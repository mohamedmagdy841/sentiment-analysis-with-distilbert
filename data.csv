"Was great until a month or so ago. Videos have constantly freezing, lagging, and just not playing at all. I have tried everything. I forced stopped tiktok and cleared the app cache and the app data. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I restarted my phone and cleared out about 20 GB of the general storage. I checked my Internet connection. Absolutely nothing worked. I put in a support ticket but received nothing back within the supposed ""1-4 business days"" that it takes to get a response.",0
"I'm tired of tiktok messing up my edits. Either they slow down my video so it doesn't match the audio anymore, they mute a lot of videos now which audio can be what makes the whole video, they remove the cover captions on the after you post so then you have to go back and edit it (which you can only do once and within 7 days of the post) and readd it in which resets your cover so u got to find your exact moment again for the cover and then when u post it the caption gets MINIMIZED to ant font!",0
"This is getting less and less optimized for my Z Fold 3. About a year ago, it was absolutely fine. About six months ago, after an update, the comment section was only visible with a quarter of what it should be. Now the most recent update gives me a black screen, sometimes cuts the used space of the video in half and the other half being black, sometimes does that except cuts the actual video in half. Even more irritating is when it works for the first couple, then goes into one of those bugs.",0
"This used to be my go to video editing app. Within the last 2 months it has had so many issues that I don't even bother trying to make a video anymore. Waste of time. I create a whole video, edit, add music, spend time making it perfect then after upload all my work is GONE. It shows the first 5 seconds then freezes and ends the video. So frustrating. This has happened so many times. Even after waiting a few days to try again. It is so incredibly frustrating.",0
"Would rate higher...but what the heck is up with this throwing my text around and everything I've edited to be precise, only to have it look like trash and make zero sense. It looks good, then when going to publish, throws text and overlays all over the place, off screen, etc. Is this a push to get me to delete the app? Cause I'm about at that point. Not the first time, but definitely getting worse.",0
Everytime I upload a drum cover it gets muted. I see others with the same drum cover posting there videos and not a problem they have their videos just fine. I do a drum cover and my stuff gets muted. I'm to the point of uninsalling this app. Every single time I upload a video it gets muted. This is a big pile of bull right here. I'm almost over TikTok period. YouTube and Facebook and Instagram don't give me them issues. But TikTok gives me nothing but problems. Trash!!,0
"In terms of function, videos are difficult to make and every time you exit the app the page restarts. So if you had an interesting video up and clicked the home button then went back into the app, it's gone. And recently I am completely unable to follow literally anybody. If I accidentally unfollow somebody I was following before, oops! Gone forever.",0
"Used to be a good app, but then the updates screwed it over. They got rid of their dark mode for Android, making it difficult for people with visual issues to see the screen from the HARSH white mode, they messed the comments up, and the pre-post to posted editing ratio is all messed up. Ex: I edit and upload a video thinking all of my text is in the frame when it isn't and half of it isn't legible from it being blurred or cut out. Used to be good, got worse.",0
"In app editing became impossible to use. Every time I edit a video, I can't save a draft and so I edit on the spot but the app freezes, crashes, and I'm left half an hour invested into the editing process with nothing to show for it. I use a Pixel phone but didn't start having issues until I started posting 3 times a week. It progressively got worse until now I can't do anything to edit inside the app.",0
"Has a number of bugs that support has put in zero effort to fix. If you minimize the app to go into a different one, tiktok will reopen itself if someone messages you. Saying ""not interested"" and blocking certain audios doesn't work, and I have specific tags blocked that STILL show up in my feed. Also now it turns on my phone's volume whenever I open the app and there's no way to stop this.",0
"Worst customer support I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. For almost half a year, I've been completely unable to log into my account due to an error. The last time I sent a ticket, customer support essentially said ""Okay but have you tried logging in?"" in a response that was almost certainly AI, and promptly ghosted me afterwards. Don't even bother. Genuinely.",0
"The editing tools are gone now and all of the good music is too. So many of my videos have been muted after I used the music they have available. I had to dispute a charge w my bank and when I got back on almost all of my videos were muted, even ones that were not copyrighted and had been previously approved and the songs are still available on the app. They definitely target accounts.",0
"I've been getting so many spammers as well as spyware. That has come from this app. I. Also, I don't understand why this app does not function correctly for me. I have the latest updated version, space, ect, but for whatever reason, it does not post my videos if they're over 3 minutes, and it also does not save to my drafts. So, all the effort I put into editing my videos. TikTok just throws my effort down the drain. If it does not improve these issues I will be deleting my account",0
Stopped letting me upload videos correctly. It would show the full video in the selection part but once I tried to edit the video it would only upload a couple seconds of each video. On the rare occasion it would let me edit the video it wouldn't upload more than the first 10 seconds even though the video should have been a minute long. Tried to get help from TikTok but they didn't reply. Uninstalling didn't help nor did restarting phone.,0
8 months ago my TikTok started loosing major features... the ability to edit.. use filters... use sounds... etc. Several friends have had similar experiences. No matter how many times we have written & requested help from TikTok...none of us have heard back. We have all tried to erase & redownload many times. Some friends have left the app now & I have barely any basic features left. I suspect that TikTok is made for iPhones and anyone with a less common phone gets issue after issue.,0
"Don't know what's going on, but I can not see the comment section. All I get is black screen, and I can only see half videos. Some videos are cut in half (screen not length), and finally I'm seeing the same videos over and over again. This started happening after an update. It worked perfectly before. SAMSUNG GALAXY FOLD 4",0
"It been several days until tik Tok completely freezes on me, whenever I try to post a video it freezes, then it crash couldn't upload video, now the tik Tok is worse than I thought. When I upload a video and play I don't hear sound. I have to keep going to app settings force stop,clear data,clear cache, restarted my phone, I unistalled reinstalled again and nothing is working. The latest update ruined the app. Y'all keep messing up the apps. I'm uninstalling it right now.",0
Honestly deserves 1 star. I've been dealing with this issue over the past two years and l've reported it previously but you guys never fix this issue for me. I try looking at filters and I try to enjoy the filters that I see in my for you page but it never gives me the option to even see them. My friends and other people are able to see these filters and use them but in my case they don't show up on my end. Please fix this issue for me it's been far too long for this continue happening.,0
"Useless after the update. I cannot log in via username. You put in the password, complete the authentication, and then it just makes you put the password in again. Top of that, my videos are disappearing? I post them and they're completely gone within less than 10 seconds. They're not getting flagged for community violations to my knowledge, they're just getting pulled. I even tried reposting a video that is currently on my page, and the same thing happens. Bricked.",0
"There's definitely been some issues with the app freezing my phone screen. Just did a restart and now I can't see any of my notifications within the app. I tried to report this to the help desk, after I tried all the recommended ways to fix the issue (which didn't work) and all I get is the ""something went wrong try again"". So, I get notifications but can't actually view comments, likes, etc.",0
It's like every time there's a new update they add something random for the commercials. Such as of course phone promos and now it's to download movie or series app. The worst part about these movie apps they are very disturbing. Having to do with SA or SEXUAL CONTACT. THAT'S ONE WAY TO KEEP ME OFF OF THIS APP. I wish there was a way to turn off commercials but unfortunately there isn't. Tiktok has been able to make me feel uncomfortable ONCE AGAIN. Thumbs down if I could write a zero I would.,0
"The algorithm in this app is broken. I keep getting recommended asmr and mukbang videos even though I hate that stuff with a burning passion. I've tried just scrolling, I've tried pressing the ""not interested"" button (which never works), and I've even tried blocking the accounts, but nothing works. Tiktok, please for the love of God fox your algorithm to where it permenantly never shows you stuff you don't want to see, it would save me and a lot of other people from being thrown into a spiral.",0
User data is out of control on this app. I have to delete my user data in Android settings just to get rid of 2 gigs of nonsense. Clearing cache is not what I mean. It's user data. Went from 0mb to 2 GB in 2 days. Unacceptable. I unfavorited all videos. Didn't help. I cleared it and it was at 50mb in one video that I didn't even click like on. One video. This is suspicious. Why does this app need that much user data. The answer. It doesn't. FIX IT or go away.,0
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE NEWEST UPDATE! Used to love the app until The new update made the transition screen spin... genuinely considering closing my account because of it. And having photosensitivity turned on does NOT change it. They give the option to avoid videos with flashing lights but put it a potential trigger that can't be removed. I would give no stars if I could. Very disappointed,0
"MALWARE!!!! Keeps moving out of the folders that I put it in after device restart. MALWARE!!! Also won't even update itself unless I tell it. Figures another pos from China. Tries unsuccessfully to censor content. The idea and concept are good to bad it's from a Chinese company. And ads are malware, try taking control of the device without authorization. And the ads at malware too.",0
"This app has gone completely down the drain lately. Every time I come back onto the app after a month or two away, I come back to find most of the audio on my old videos have been muted, which leaves me no choice but to delete those old videos. All those years of making content on Musical.ly/TikTok has certainly not paid off. If you want to be a content creator today, stay away from this app. You're better off making short form content on YouTube.",0
"Video thumbnails/previews quit showing About a month ago I lost the ability to see video previews on any profile, to include my own. If I go to a creators profile to view their videos, or even my own profile, each thumbnail is blank. **After new app update, still can't see thumbnails/previews and the long press to select playback speed has been moved to the bottom when it was conveniently at the top. What is that about??!",0
"i have used this app regularly for over a year. i really enjoyed until the most recent update. now, between tabs, it does this awful ppt transition on the screen. like it spins the entire screen a couple times and then goes back to where you wanted to go. it's not only deeply annoying because the transition is too long and too overt, it causes a headache. i like tiktok and the info i get from the creators i follow, but this update is the most bizarre and unnecessary app change ive ever seen.",0
"The content on the app is enjoyable and, sometimes, informative. However, the new pinwheeling screen transition between menus is headache-inducing, and makes using the app 1000% worse. I have tried reaching out to the support team in the app, but have not gotten a response, and there is no settings option to turn it off.",0
"Lately, I've had so MANY issues with this app. To begin, my saved audios have all disappeared. I have them saved (if i click on an audio, i can save it), but when i go to my saved audios it is all blank. Please fix this. Also, sometimes filters will just stop working out of nowhere. My account got deleted because I was under the age of thirteen... TIK TOK.. I AM 18! I changed my username, and the app suddenly refuses to work and kicks me out of the app. If this keeps happening, I'm uninstalling",0
"I haven't been able to save videos to my device for the past several weeks, I've updated the app, cleared my storage and cache, switched between wifi connection, and I still get an error message claiming I have to try again, in which it will just stay frozen until I cancel. This app is decent content wise, but the fact I can't save that content even when the content posters allow it is absolutely absurd and I feel as if it requires an update to that portion of the app.",0
"I've had tiktok since it was musically and always loved it and every update. This new update, however, has completely ruined the repost feature. It's annoying and inefficient. I liked being able to comment on someone's repost. Now though, to comment on a repost It's not gonna be in the original comment section of the video. I also can no longer download videos before posting them with the new update, which was a great feature to have. It would also be nice to be able to search slide shows.",0
"10/31/23 Still unable to see what filters are being used so I can use them. But now, for the last week, there's a bug/glitch going on. I'm either unable to scroll after 10 minutes or if I do get to scroll it's the same three videos over and over and 90% of the time it's useless ads. Tiktok is broken. 1/19/24 new glitch, if you pause a video, after a few seconds it will start playing again.",0
"Has not been tracking anything. I've been liking for two days now. I have tried everything from exiting and reopening, opening w/o wifi, clearing cache, and uninstalling and reinstalling. Nothing, its really frustrating, and nothing has worked. I would like a video on the fyp and go to my liked history and refresh my profile, and the video will quite literally disappear. I dont know what else to do about it.",0
"The app was going great when they suddenly removed my ability to add a location which resulted in a massive drop in engagement. I reported it several times. They replied that using location is only available to select people when I HAD access to it just a week before, I explained this to them and they responded with the same reply. This is a STANDARD feature of any social media app and it seems like they don't want to fix it for me. I uninstalled and reinstalled and am still having the issue.",0
"I've had a pretty good experience so far on TikTok but I'm now running into an issue. It was working normally until I deleted it and then reinstalled it. It now won't let me long into my account saying ""no Internet connection"" when I have a clear connection. I've tried uninstalling the app again, restarting it, restarting my phone, clearing the data. Nothing is working and I'm pretty bummed.",0
"I used to have absolutely zero issues with this app and I loved it even, but recently I haven't been able to watch either mine or most of my mutuals videos and it's really annoying. I keep getting a ""couldn't play video"" error/message. I have gone through numerous different troubleshooting techniques and nothing has worked. Fix it please or I'm deleting.",0
I miss the app tiktok used to be. Now there's ads that will pop up during a video that your watching. Three times now I've had a video basically ruined for me because an ad cuts off the end. I find it crazy that started happening as soon as people started blocking the shop hashtags. TT developers if you're listening the ads are too much it takes every drop of fun away (I'm sure you don't actually care anything to get that money right) the app is trash!,0
"Video thumbnails/previews quit showing About a month ago I lost the ability to see video previews on any profile, to include my own. lf I go to a creators profile to view their videos, or even my own profile, each thumbnail is blank. I have to physically tap a video and scroll through each to view the content. I've tried clearing cache, data, uninstalling and reinstalling (which fixed it for about 5 seconds) to no avail and there is no update available so that is not the issue either.",0
"Unsatisfactory Glitches with Uploading and Posting Without Resolution: I thought I would post a first video to this app which was a picture with a sound file attached. It all acted like it uploaded and posted but no sound. Yes my speakers work, no it's not a business account. Sound is enabled, etc. I googled the question and nothing works, yes the sounds tiktok has available do play and they suck, so this app must just be randomly glitchy. I'm not about wasting my time on cheap buggy apps.",0
"When I creator uploads a video, and wants to purchase a promotion pack, sometimes the music needs to be changed. When the sound is changed, it can remove parts of the video like a voice recording, which can completely ruin the video. When you try to fix this, it doesn't let you. I hate using this app as a creator, because it doesn't automatically recommend promotion-compliant songs to begin with, and it doesn't let you edit or delete the video.",0
"Glitchy. Record a video, edit it, selext music, save it as a draft, go back to rerecord...all the work has gone. The video is back to its unedited form with different music. Original sound gone from recordings. Crashes constantly. Laggy. Used to be good. Then they got lazy as they got rich. If Tiktok was a new UI, it would die. Awful app these days. They don't care.",0
"I love TikTok, it's entertaining when you are bored and wastes time, but there is just one problem, everytime I try to record a video, nothing happens at first, but if I mess up or I need to re-record the video, I re-record it, and then that's when it starts to lag, sometimes, I record a video only one time, and then I go to edit it, it starts to lag again, I already tried updating it, but it still didn't work.If the developers can fix this, please do.",0
"A good app but all of a sudden .ow one of the most worst app you will ever found on Google playstore, the customer service is very very bad, no they will never attend to your problem no matter how hard you try. You can't follow some certain accounts that needs request and most of the time You can't even chat your new friend, it keeps showing message limit reach, you can't chat anymore. How I wish I can give 0 star.",0
"After 2 year, reinstalled the app due to glitches, but the issues persist. It's even worse now with lagging and freezing, making it impossible to watch anythink.i reported this before, but no action has been taken. Tried troubleshooting steps like clearing cause, restarting the phone, but the problem seems with the app itself. Until it's fixed,i'am uninstalling it again.",0
"Have used this since musical.ly and I have always loved it but since the new update I cannot get into the app. Like every time I click on the icon on my home screen it flashes the black screen with the logo for a split second and then closes again. I am absolutely not gonna uninstall it, I have so many important drafts but I actually can't open the app. I'm so mad at this.",0
"Bad UI, makes it easy to make irreversible mistakes without any confirmation, as buttons don't always appear in the same place, opposite actions are next to each other, popup appears unexpectedly under your finger and you don't know what you pressed; unintuitive settings. Easy only to mindlessly scroll, which, btw, I have never seen more mind dumbing content.",0
"Its been giving me problems after every update everytime I update it, it doesn't want to open at all, it completely kicks me out if the app, I tried restarting my phone, switching my phone off for hours and deleting and reinstalling the app, but nothing works at all this is really frustrating, because I usually go on this app often, and now I have no access to it",0
"I just can't take it anymore my app isn't responding for a long time. When I tap in it it seems like it's opening but suddenly it all goes black and refuses to open goes back to the home screen that's annoying it needs to be fixed. It happened to me last year. I thought maybe it's fixed but not yet. I am telling if it's not going to fix, then I have to delete TikTok. I am deleting TikTok if TikTok is not working anymore..",0
"The more I click ""not interested"" on videos, the more I get them. Video after video is clips from shows & and movies, and it's extremely annoying. I've tried resetting my fyp but the same thing. Fyp is not what I like to watch anymore. tiktok just pushes low quality content. I'm going to lose my mind if young Sheldon & Grey's anatomy clips show up again. Anyway, this is get deleted. So trash.",0
"I haven't had many issues with tiktok, the only reason for the one star is the absolute lack of dark mode support on Android, as someone just moving over from an apple device it's so blinding. I mean there should be absolutely no reason for this, even the desktop PC version has dark mode!!! There is no excuse!",0
"I can't edit any video at all! Every time I try to edit a video the app just crash! I can edit like 3 video clips and then it says that TikTok is not responding and then it shuts down. I've tried to forcestop it, restart my phone etc, nothing. I can't delete the app and reinstall it because the first time it crashed it somehow managed to save it as a draft. So if I delete the app it will go away. And I spend quite some time on this one. I'm going crazy, been sitting with this sense yesterday!",0
"I have been using this app for a few years now and never had a problem with it. All of a sudden, they started to mute some of my videos because the songs were 'copyrighted'. The songs from those videos weren't if popular songs. They even muted a video of mine with its ORIGINAL AUDIO. The video had a small bit of music, which was copyright free in the first place.",0
"I've had tiktok for pretty long, but recently there was another update (which is normal).tik Tok had updated the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, I don't like the captions on my screen blocking most of the video . I know how to take the captions off but even if I turn the setting off, the captions will still show up. The is very annoying, hope they fix the problem soon:)",0
"I liked it better when you were able to pause slideshows because half the time, I don't want to hear the audio. Also, I can't use tiktok for more than twenty minutes because then the videos stop loading and I can't watch them for over an hour. It's apparently an issue with my WiFi being slow, but if I have my WiFi and data on it still doesn't load. My WiFi works perfectly, so I think it's a problem with the app.",0
"It takes too long to update! Not only that, its the lagging and the battery usage, one app shouldnt take up half my battery in an hour aswell as the fact that when I make Capcut vids, it will put the video straight to draft after I've tried posting it, OR it will put me back on capcut, tiktok's issue is they got lazy after how rich theyve become. Fix.Your.App!",0
"This app works once in a while. I have issues with not being able to view videos on my fyp. It's just loading, I hear no audio nothing. It's starting to get annoying because I like to scroll through in my free time. When it stops working, it could go for weeks at a time. I did everything refreshed, Uninstall Reinstall nothing seems to work. If yall hv such a big platform please ensure to listen to comment with issues to try to fix them.",0
"Lately, the app has been awfully slow. For some context, I usually have a 5G internet connection, and I live in a country that has one of the fastest internet. The videos load, but take awfully long, and the only ones that work properly are slide shows. I tried reinstalling the app and restarting my phone, but nothing helped. I am not the only one with this problem, since my friend also has this problem.",0
"I've never had problems with this app before. Last week it stopped working. I have tried everything. Uninstalling it, restarting my phone, logging in and out, cleared the cache... Nothing works. It's just a black screen when I open it and says I'm not connected to a network even though I have data and wifi and all my other apps work.. I can see a few videos on my for you page but can't login to my account and it won't load more videos.. I'm pretty frustrated.",0
"After 1 year, reinstalled the app due to glitches,but the issuse persist.it s even worse now with lagging and freezing, making it impossible to watch anythink.l reported this befour, but no action has been taken . Tried troubleshooting steps like clearing cache, restarting the phone, but the problem seems with the app itself. Until it's fixed,i'm uninstalling it again.",0
"Until tiktok makes a fix for their brightness issues with certain videos changing android screens... you get a one star... I have checked all settings possible, I have never before experienced these issues until I updated a few weeks ago. IPhone users already have their temp fix. This is absolutely not acceptable to have an app adjust screen brightness when everything possible is turned off so it cant... meanwhile it chooses to do it on every few videos every day. A Samsung user...",0
"goes through phases of being overrun with ads every 2-4 videos and then going back to normal, often the search bar resets if i try press space, content generally very repetitive with most being ads/sponsors/tiktok shop/businesses/""hussle"" content, 99 blocks is far too low, full of pro-eating disorder content despite not interacting, hate speech filters are useless, always shows content from previously blocked accounts, generally glitchy with audio, needs an accessible content exclusivity toggle.",0
"Request liked it better when you were able to pause slideshows because half the time, I don't want to hear the audio. Also, I can't use tiktok for more than twenty minutes because then the videos stop loading and I can't watch them for over an hour. It's apparently an issue with my WiFi being slow, but if I have my WiFi and data on it still doesn't load. My WiFi works perfectly, so I think it's a problem with the app My tiktok I'd @Saharul0007",0
"I have loaded the app on my Samsung 23+. Whenever I try to start TT after someone sends me a link or I try to get the full clip from one of the short teasers, it takes me to the Google Play store and demands that I install the already installed app. If I go back to the link I just repeat band if I open the ap it just does a normal cold start and ignores the referring link. This used to work. Frustrating.",0
"Going back in & finding all your vids have been muted. Copyright changes. Fine. Fixed the issue. Now videos that I just created have ALSO been muted. Videos that I've fixed the sound on have been remuted, my ORIGINAL audio - as in our voices - are missing, OR replacing sounds with the exact same song that has been muted?!?! An absolute waste of users time. So what exactly is the point of this app any more??",0
"Usually enjoy this app and making videos but when you find half of the sounds removed to the videos you spent time making, makes me not want to upload and post videos anymore cos it's just a waste of time when they mute the sounds. Sucks big time. Also videos are freezing when trying to edit them. About to uninstall the damn app it's so frustrating!",0
"Updated the app , now it crashes within 2 seconds of opening it. Updates are supposed to fix things nit create problems ms that didnt exist, i also remember this happened before with an update and it took weeks for them to sort it out. Haaaaa new update releases day after i updated but that fixed nothing , still crashes, unbelievable, 3rd update still hasn't sorted out the crashing upon start up, unbelievable",0
"I have the same problem in Tik Tok that whatever sound I like or save to make my video, then at the time of making the video, that sound is not audible to me, so fix it, update the application. I have also seen others in my friend's Cape, so they are not preferred, even if they prefer the sound, the sound that is there is not audible to us at the present time.",0
"My tiktok app just won't open from the past few days. I don't know if it's the phone storage or something but I tried deleting alot of stuff and I do actually have enough storage to get an app running, but it's still not working. The app just won't open up. Everyone I click on the app it just brings me back to my homescreen or my phone starts lagging. This hasn't happened before and DOES NOT happen with any other apps ONLY TIKTOK. Please help I need to use tiktok.",0
"The app works terribly! It always has for me but now? 2024 tiktok? Awful. Literally I open the app, watch one video, if I scroll the app will crash. I have tried several different WiFi,data, everything. It just isn't working anymore. Idk if this is a new update crashing the servers or because this app is optimised for iPhone but this needs to get sorted out because it's SO BAD!!!! I like watching cat videos/silly tiktok series but none of them are worth it to watch 1sec of then crashed out yk?☹️",0
"The app worked fine before but now I can't post videos no more.. I will finish an edit and then when i post or save it to my phone the video will stop playing half way. It's odd bc even when it's been posted already, it doesn't play the full edit.. it just stops playing half way and freezes the video but continues to play only the audio!!!",0
"Makes my phone lag like hell anytime it's opened, or if I even get a notification. Uses an alarming amount of storage. I installed yesterday, followed one friend with 8 posts, posted nothing myself, gave no permission - and somehow have 1.56gb of ""user data"". Never experienced anything like this with any other app. Makes me concerned with what it's trying to do in the background.",0
"When I close the app to do other things the app will pop up and reopen itself randomly. Getting spammed with fake ""you are selected as winner"" accounts. At first all my reports came back as not against their tos but now they're just ignored. Also they direct you towards an unhelpful FAQ and at the bottom it says ""is your problem resolved"" and the no button literally doesn't work. It's not a button. Only yes is a button.",0
"Does not open when I press it, it always rejects and when it stops refusing, it froze along with the other apps that froze as well. I had to restart my phone to work (it's not my phone this the problem but the app that is damaging it). I would rather save my phone than to break it by pieces from a ridiculous error in the app. Do what you can to fix it.",0
"Every once in a while it comes out of me and I have to delete the program and download it and it keeps working fine and you find that it went out on its own and it keeps downloading. I hope you can solve it so give me some time If I upload videos for a long time, I will be prohibited from doing anything that does not comply with the law",0
"Loved the app, I followed the rules. I didn't make videos, but I would comment. Till today when I got randomly permanently banned. But they don't make it easy to find any information on how to get it appealed. So. Stuck permanently banned from one of my favorite apps that allows me to send funny videos to friends and support people, with no way of fixing it.",0
"App was fine until today, I can't open the app, I tried switching off my phone but still nothing happened and this actually the second time this is happening and I uninstalled it and settled for tiktok lite but unfortunately you can't view pictures in tiktok lite so I uninstalled tiktok lite and installed the original tiktok and now it's doing the same thing again, it wants me to uninstall and install again and I can't keep doing that everytime I encounter this problem please fix it",0
"mainly have this app to stay updated but it does definitely glitch a lot at times and its quite overbearing. countless times the videos, profiles and audios won't load, despite uninstalling and downloading again, clearing cache or simply logging out. do better tiktok!",0
"Yeah I still can't follow one my new account. Works fine on main account. Please fix. Driving me up the wall. I am making content but cannot engage, and soon the algorithm will tag me as non engaging and I will lose views. I have just updated the app. I use WiFi and data and on only 1 account can I not follow. I have cleared cache and still the error persists. When I reported a problem I got the same advice back as I visually reported during my bug report.",0
"[09/23] Crashing when try to open, not fixed since aug 28th update. Fix your app or let me save my drafts externally from the app. [04/24] Every time there's an update I have to reinstall the app. This sucks. I just lost 6 drafts -_- why are you this incompetent to allow this for more than 6 months",0
"It is annoying, I'd open the app and they'd just show the black screen, and for the next 5 minutes, it's still loading, I can't use it to do ANYTHING.. It's just taking up space. I updated it, hoping that would change something, it didnt, I'm updating it again. Nothing changes? I'm done I officially hate this app, just used over 100mb updating it for nothing to change... Uninstalled",0
Why does all of you lives continue on even when I don't click on them! After I pass a live the live audio just continues. I actually have to close the app and reopen it to stop it. They've even had updates since and nothing has changed. If it continues very much longer I'll go to YouTube and never look back,0
"TikTok app is the most intrusive app. I did a packet sniff and my data is being tampered with. Also why is the app so laggy? YouTube runs flawlessly but this app seems like a beginner wrote all the code. I will open again on one month if it continues to lag met out I am for sure never coming back. Tell your Programmera to learn OPTIMIZATION LOOPS, and error Loops. Once I got on it it wanted my contacts. That is so intrusive. I kinda don't trust this app now at all and I only had it 10 minutes",0
"Tiktok has been having this issue for awhile where it doesn't open and sits on one page for 10 minutes and still does nothing. Or just doesn't open at all. Now after being redownloaded, it's reverted back to before all the updates when it was first released, and once the app is closed, it doesn't load and I have to uninstall and reinstall again only for it to be of unupdated and showing there are none needed. Please fix this.",0
"If click the button that I'm not interested in any live videos, I shouldn't keep getting them. I block someone or say an ad is irrelevant........ I shouldn't keep seeing either. Especially repeatedly, I've blocked the same account multiple times and the app will wait a week or two and suddenly they are unblocked and on my fyp. Lol I bet they never actually change your ads or adjust anything when you tell them you don't like an ad. Just give a fake message.",0
Never liked this app or any apps for the matter. This isn't a developmental error or anything. I love the Sounds feature for music over short videos I think people do that all the time with snapchat but Instagram is sorta at ease with the Targeting your most probable audience and showing you what that is and to likeit.,0
"For some reason a bug has suddenly popped up where the app crashes immediately anytime I try to open it. Clearing the cache hasn't fixed it, and my phone suggests waiting for an update from the devs to fix it. Also, aside from the functional problem I'm experiencing, I do have to say that the moderation is absolutely abysmal. People could say the most vile things on the planet in a comment and it'll still come back ""no violation"" when reported.",0
"The app was fine until it started getting rid of all of the sounds the app legit used to be called MUSICALLY but now all we have is silly budget songs I had a song on my video that was from MY LITTLE PONY and it got taken down due to ""copyright"" reasons? That's silly bring the sounds back. Me and a lot of other people have videos based around a specific song but nearly everything good has been taken down which is stupid fix this TikTok there was absolutely no reason for it",0
"with all due respect, this app had a huge downfall in all ways possible, this used to be a music app, dancing app whatever it was literally called musical.ly when it became tik tok it was fine at first but this past year and a couple of months ago it became horrible, first of all removing half of the sounds ever made on tik tok due to ""copyright""??bffr.. copyright was never a problem before but all of a sudden it is? second of all the animations/transitions in the app remove that bs.",0
"You guys are a music app, so I can't understand why you'd take the music away when it's literally the main concept. 90% of my liked and favorite videos are muted, and multiple editors, much like myself, are forced to delete their videos. It's so upsetting when you spent hours on edits that get great reviews on it only for tiktok to mute the music.",0
"This week it had to receive kind of new update because now I can't SCROLL EVEN 3 TIMES WITHOUT THE APP FREEZING, the same happens with when I try to see profile or see my reposts, favourites,liked videos etc. I know time goes on and it's supposed to fit new phones but man at least make some ""for older phones"" feature when you can actually scroll,see profiles and do stuff",0
"Trash app. First, their annoying website constantly pushes me to download the app. I cave and finally do that. Now I can't even register an account because it says my account is suspended when I never even made one in the first place. Tried this with multiple emails. Same issue. Most broken app I've ever tried to use.",0
"Dear TikTok Support Team, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to report an issue I am facing on my TikTok account. I am unable to find the option to add playlists to my account. Despite exploring the settings and features, the playlist addition option does not appear. I would appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter as I am eager to organize and share my content efficiently. Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue. Sincerely @wadiha74",0
"I hate Tik Tok, and don't want to see it at all. But it's ads, have killed my devices. If their so confident about their baby (The App) why aggressively advertising it! I never seen so many ads back to back, when I'm try to watch a 2 minutes important video? Stop bombarding people devices!! I wish I could give you - stars",0
"""YoU hAvE dIsCoVeReD a PrEmIuM fEaTuRe"" (basic functions like showing my my goddamn liked music ever since I stopped paying premium). Disrespectfully decline, I'll switch back to owning copies instead of paying for streaming since not only that, but the company seems to be remarkably greedy with that sus EULA for audiobook publishers, too much greed for an app that hasn't received any UI improvements in years... Seems they're too invested in licensing and profit, not in giving us better service.",0
There are so many lags and errors and it's so annoying.This time i couldn't even open the app. I restarted my phone so many times and it still didn't work. Then i delete it and downloaded it again and some facilities/features are GONE. What am i supposed to do. I can't repost and it's absurd,0
"Its an entertaining app but for the past month only two or three effects will work for me. I tried to update, clear catche etc but nothing works. I let some time pass thinking they will start working but still nothing. Please let me know how to fix this problem and ill give tik tok more stars.",0
"I used to have an old account, which I posted probably around 4 videos on before I deleted the app, all of them were drawings / animations, nothing against the guidelines. Recently, I've tried to make a new account. Whenever I even open the app, it keeps refreshing the login screen, and telling me my ""account has been permanently banned due to breaking multiple guidelines"".... I've never posted anything other than back in 2020 which were just innocent drawing animations. Tiktok, fix this please",0
"The apps from device to device vary so much its annoying. One phone gets 10 min videos ,another doesn't . The desktop version is a dumbed down its not even worth using , when in fact that would be the best way to edit and post quality videos",0
"Using this app has made me appreciate how much effort goes into YouTube shorts The app has no dislike button (only ""not interested"" which is hidden in the long press menu And that's not even mentioning the complete lack of a dark mode entirely on android which is just lazyness it's on PC and iOS and the UI does not feel native i wouldn't mind that if they used a dark mode but no darkmode Overall I wish I could like this app but it feels like a worse version of YouTube shorts.",0
I can't make new account. Please fix this!,0

"I'm now starting to get ads mid-video. So, so many Lives back to back that get stuck and freeze for almost a full minute and if I try and scroll past it, the audio continues into the next video. I don't want to see a Live every other video, and I don't want pre-roll ads in the middle of whatever video I'm watching. These money grabs are getting ridiculous.",0
I have a couple of issues with this app. 1. It sometimes crashes when I switch to a different app and then return back to it. I also experience crashes sometimes when I exit someone's profile. 2. No dark mode. iPhones got the feature several years ago and the Android app still hasn't gotten it. Every other social platform at this point has implemented a dark mode on Android except for TikTok.,0
"I usually love the app and love being on it, but in the new update, there's ""transitions"" when you go from screen to screen and when you start recording a video and discard it, the whole damn screen spins for a few seconds. It is the most inconvenient thing and it gives me such a headache. Theres no option to turn it off either. Its keeping me off the app as of right now thats for sure.",0
"More and more problems everyday. None of which i can actually get help with. There's a certain video I can't download at all, but every other video is fine. Sometimes my likes don't go through cause of ""server issues"" so I can't find them afterward. Too many times I can't favorite a video so I can find it later. And before you say it, yes, I've gone back and all these videos still exist days/weeks/months after my problem, including the accounts. So in short, it's starting to get worse.",0
"Video editing in tiktok is a nightmare. There is no way to split audio tracks, and editing a video to line up with a song is nearly impossible without a huge a mount of trial and error. Additionally the option is there to change the cover of the video, but it isn't actually possible, there is no way to save the new cover only to go back and discard it.",0
"I was automatically logged out of the app on April 7th and each time I've tried to log back in, the error message ""Please try again later or use a different method"" is returned. I can still login via the browser, so my account isn't locked and my information is correct. I have a support ticket open, but support takes days to reply and I am worried about having to reinstall the app and losing all my drafts. Super frustrating situation.",0
"Earlier today posted some videos on my TikTok account, all of them are showing 0 viewers. Just 2 videos show only 1 viewer. This happened before and after I've updated TikTok today. Along with restarting my android phone. The updates/notifications are really messed up. The inbox button usually shows a red dot for updates/notifications. It shows a red dot all the time. When I click the inbox, nothing new. For the love of all TikTok users, please help fix this issue, and/or glitch.",0
"Alright, I don't know if the ads you get are personalized, so this could be some past that I can't remember coming around now, but I keep getting ads of dating apps that are very suggestive and show women with very clear features ig is the only way i can think of describing it. But this is super weird to me, I just swipe away immediately and they come back after one or two different ads. Its super annoying, but the app itself is fine, i just don't know where else to post this problem.",0
"Used to be my favorite app, but in the last few months all the filters I use disappeared, and filters that other people are using can be found. And it keeps crashing due to ""connection issues"" but when I go to another app it's just fine. It also won't let me create the slideshows because I have an android. I'm seriously thinking ab getting rid of the app, but don't want to because I don't have anything else.",0
"Recently bought the Galaxy Z Fold 5, and this app struggles while the phone is unfolded. At times, videos get shifted off the screen to where you only get to see half of it. If the video opens correctly and you open the comments, this can shift the video off screen and never return when closing the comments. Additionally, if you accidentally click to recharge your coins, the only way to get out is to close the app.",0
"The main issue that I have is that downloads go into the camera folder. On any other app, they would go to internal storage/pictures/(name of app) or at least DCIM/(name of app) but TikTok just puts them in DCIM/Camera which is extremely annoying for organizing my pictures and videos when they get mixed together. Please at least include an option to change where downloads are saved!",0
As the app keeps being changed. It causes issues trying to make a video. It keeps closing and glitching making it hard to finish an editing. So not able to build effects for the videos easily anymore. Now only 2 effects can be put on. Then u have to save video and reload what is done to it. Then add more effect by 2. Otherwise u chance not getting the marks u needed for skit. Or messing up the small 4 count it gives to try and add extra. Without a DL already edit vid or another app to edit 😒,0
"One of the worst apps I've ever used. I'm late to the party but who cares. The app crashes multiple times, logs me out, can't log in and so many features that it'll take me a year to figure it out. If that is I can ever get in. It keeps me logged in for like a day before kicking me out and then I can't get back in. I'm trying to promote a business here on the most popular app and I can't. I have to uninstall it and then reinstall to get in.",0
"I love to waste time on this app, but recent updates have made it so hard to navigate on a Galaxy ZFold 4. (tablet mode specifically) I go to check comments and it pulls half the video off screen. When I try to go back to the video, I now can only see half of it. And the comment section disappears completely and I'm left with half a video and a black bar for any other video I try to watch. Please fix 😫",0
"it's always taking so long to play videos as I flip through the app. it's one thing when it's a 3min video or if I have bad service but even on strong wifi and great phone service, the tiktok app has been lagging SEVERELY with their videos. inwatched reels in Instagram and Facebook and they have no issue so it's the app. and this is even after I updated it.... very disappointing",0
This app messes with my whole phone. It makes it glitch out and turn off randomly. When I open the app now it turns my volume up to full and I can't fix it. The type board is horrible I'll be typing and it just disappears and then when it appears again I type something and then it just turns off the whole app in general. The support team on tik Tok is horrible as well I've reported issues and they have not been fixed at all.,0
I love the app! I'm looking forward to creating more on there! I don't like that the app can get slow when editing or posting a video. For instance today I picked out the cover of my video and it totally didn't set. Now my video has a weird cover. It's happened to me multiple times. I think there should be an edit feature for that specific default. Even for editing the caption! There could be a lot of great fixes! Please listen to your users! 🤘🫶,0
"Good app, great time killer. I wish it didn't save content to my default camera folder. The same folder I use for taking photos with the default camera app. This creates tons of confusion and wasted time trying to find my actual photos, it'd be more convenient if it made it's own folder labeled ""TikTok"" or something, just not the default camera folder. Will add the 3 missing stars for that feature, until then I'm turning off the ability to save content to my device as a result",0
"I've had TikTok since it came out, and I never had any issues with it until recently. I don't know why, but it would essentially stop working all together. Delayed sound, video, and just overall poor performance. I thought it was my phone at first, so I've factory reset it, but now I have a little warning sign stating ""recent data has been collected on similar devices, this app may stop working on this device."" So now I'm unsure if I should install it again or not :l",0
"Reloading videos I've already seen and liked, not loading videos at all even though I'm on wifi and have good cell reception. Over the past week, nothing has been loading. I'll be sitting next to my router and the videos will be waiting to load like in in an area with bad cell reception. I've never seen any problems like this and I'm considering deleting the app cause this is ridiculous.",0
"Ever since I knew it was a thing I've had TikTok and enjoyed its capabilities. I am however leaving you with TWO stars as of right now. Your latest update is complete and utter trash. Slow loading, voice is slower than the usual when it comes to matching up with the video. I haven't gotten ANY notifications in days, among other issues. If this continues to happen I will no longer be using it. It's more of a headache than an enjoyment with captain LAG",0
"Tiktok is great and I'd give it more stars, except ever since the update I can't send my friends videos. I've logged out logged back in, yay, I can send! Jk no just one video. I cleared my cache, yay! Jk no, only one, then they get taken off the list and I can't see them, but I can still text them, I just can't send videos. And it'll let me send to people I've NEVER SENT VIDEOS OR TEXTED! It's really frustrating not being able to share videos with my friends. Pls fix this 😭",0
I would give it a better rating but the app can be a little difficult to navigate or work at times. Personally my biggest issue is that I can not edit captions or tags on posts I make and this is a big issue for me because my phone is slow and sensitive so there's times I spend time making or editing a video and when I go to put my caption and tags in sometimes it will just skip the caption part and just post the video and then I have to delete it because I can't edit and restart,0
"Too many issues. Went to upload a video, it came back completely black with audio, no video. Saved my posts to my phone as just black with audio. If I deactivate my profile temporarily, all my posts are marked as ""Violating guidelines"" I lost 50+ posts because of this and haven't been motivated to pick up the pieces by making new posts. You don't truly enjoy this app unless you have money. I've lost interest in TikTok. What a hassle.",0
"It's a good app but it has flaws. For me, the app keeps freezing and going mute. It also freezes my whole phone. If I try to leave the app, I have to power off my phone before going on anything else sometimes. And it lags so much. It might be my phone, though, I really don't know. Make it work for other phones, not just iPhones. The app can't function unless it's the only thing on my phone. It needs to be fixed. It's taking over my phone like a virus. Also, too many ads and pop-ups. Fix it.",0
"It's okay, but there's a bug when your searching videos. When I search something up, the first few videos are related to what I search up, then its random stuff, or if im searching up a show, it will show the results of the show, then start focusing on one character instead on the entire show. It is extremely annoying and I recommend you fix it.",0
"Too many commercials. Too many scammer ""winning"" pages constant contacting me. Tiktok refuses to stop or remove or check malicious sites in the bio! Algorithm gets messed up if you accidentally click o. A random vid not in follow. Also changes Algorithm and ads if i stop or click on and ad once! No humans to fix things! We are NOT in a place were AI can be fully free to run stuff!!!! Only good for fast swiping up until maybe one makeup vid is good enough to stop and watch 1 tip",0
"Their ""support"" is honestly a joke. I've been stuck with commercial sounds for 5 months with little to no help on correcting the issue. The algorithm is trash, and there are multiple content creators experiencing the same issues. Feedback is always asked, but nothing is ever really fixed. It's kind of a major bummer.",0
"The app functions well, but I do dislike the fact that most features are either exclusive, or get removed after a certain amount of time (for example, Dark Mode, Slideshows, Lives, Picture Replies, Video Replies, etc.), I also find the lack of free speech and truthfulness in content /comment posting, comments will be shadow removed without any notice or alert, saying the wrong thing will get your comment / video taken down, even if it's something light. These issues probably still wont be fixed.",0
"The video editing features are the most frustrating I've ever encountered - so buggy, constantly changing/moving options, no real tutorial about how it works or when it changes. The level of anxiety and frustration faced when doing the simplest edits makes it not even worth trying to connect with people online anymore.",0
"Captions have stopped appearing, and the option to turn them on has gone. It's not in accessibility settings, it's not in options available from pressing and holding white watching videos, it's not available in the share options of videos. I can no longer view closed captions. App is useless. (Also lots of issues with censorship and data control and how it takes days or weeks to train the algorithm to show you content you want to see but only a few off topic video interactions to ruin it)",0
"I've had TikTok for pretty long, but recently there was another update (which is normal).Tik Tok had updated the generated captions which is actually really great! But not for me, I don't like the captions on my screen blocking most of the video. I know how to take the captions off but even if I turn the setting off, the captions will still show up. The is very annoying, hope they fix the problem soon and effect problems:)",0
"Love this app, expecially for editing and creating videos. But lately it has been terrible. It's been glitching and having frozen moments and doesn't want create videos smoothly. Its extremely frustrating, it would be nice if the app could have more editing options as well as longer music options. Very annoying to always have shorter ones. Otherwise it's a fantastic app and some really great content. It would be nice if monitor of abuse and inappropriate behaviour towards animals are monitored",0
"i've used tiktok for a year now and it's really good but i was gonna post a video and it didn't let me crop at all, since there's a new update it's kinda hard to find the buttons from before. I've had this happen to me since August and it annoys me. ANOTHER PROBLEM: It doesnt make me slideshows? If this is a bug please fix it. Nov 2: Okay this is getting old now. Im not making tiktoks anymore, it says ""we make it easier to shoot videos!"" But you just made it worse💀 2024:it doesnt show my notify",0
"I love this app so much, but I have not been able to open the app without it crashing instantly.This happened at the beginning of October as well.Other huawei p20 users are having the same issue. Please get back to me about this.I have emailed and you say you have flagged this issue, however nothing has changed and you won't respond to anymore of my emails! The issue was solved around mid October. NOV. 6 edit: This has happened again :( edit: MAR 2 this has happened again, unable to open, APR 21",0
"Hard to Find Stuff: Sometimes, it's tough to find what you want on TikTok. There are so many videos, and it can be tricky to locate specific ones. Also, the Explore page doesn't always show things you're interested in. Same Stuff Over and Over: TikTok sometimes shows the same kinds of videos a lot. This might not be so good if you want to see different things and explore new content.",0
"App works relatively fine most of the time, except this one major thing. Now idk if its only happening to me, but it has happened multiple times. I try to send a video to my friend, so I hit share, and the correct person. Yet it sends to someone else. I double check before hitting send, it is not my fault. Please fix this. Another issue is you can't delete messages. The option is there, but it doesn't go away for the other person. If you hit delete message, its gone for you, never for the other.",0
"Everything was working well until they started to mute my videos for ""copyright issues"" because of the sound. I used the sound from Tiktok itself and after a few months the sound has been deleted from the app so I have to choose another one. And now most of the videos I post are muted because of copyright issues because there's music in the background. Unfortunately it makes want to stop posting on this app because there's too much restrictions now",0
"For 2 months, I have not received notifications from the creators I have selected to get all notifications from. All my settings for notifications are set properly. Nothing has been turned off. I uninstalled and reinstalled with no change to receiving notification. Submitted screen shots to tiktok help, only for them to ask for more screen shots of the same pics I already submitted. Is anyone else having this problem?",0
"With the new update and I'm only able to save sounds and not videos to bookmarks? Is this the only way to save videos in the app without having to download them?? And why can't I ""like"" someone's repost, I can only like the original creators video since there's no other way of actually seeing someone's repost without coincidentally stumbling upon the video itself? The update has been slightly frustrating and disappointing..",0
"Some of my favorite lives show up in my feed across the messages and activity board and then some don't. I can go on my old phone and look and they will be live but not on my new one. And yes I follow them. This app has so many problems, constantly freezing up. Taking forget to load. It's frustrating.",0
Having issues with tiktoks new update i got yesterday. Freezing up. While in others videos surfing around I get to hear that video but I kicks you back to a random place you looked at 10 15 Mims ago also freezing up it close the app for me but the voice just keeps talking i either reopen it again close again and the open it then fixes or i have to restart phone this is a new phone too like a week old. Also it say I have 4 new messages in inbox and there isn't. I'd appreciate it,0
"Entertaining but several issues and problems with algorithm and ""for you"" page results. There are also a myriad of upload and editing related quirks that make it difficult to control content, as well as security risks associated with permissions that are prompted continuously. Additionally, most rewards are misleading and do not actually grant ""gift cards.""",0
"TikTok used to be fun. I used to see all sorts of entertaining videos. However, now the app has turned into a glorified ad space. Ever since the rolling out of TikTok Shop, my fyp and the fyp of friends have been filled with nothing but constant ads for products. At first it was minimal but it just keeps getting more and more frequent. The last few days I haven't seen a single video that wasn't an ad for a TikTok shop product or a third-party app.",0
"tik tok was great back in the day but it's gotten a lot worse. the content is boring and every third video is an ad, it won't let me repost my videos and my tik tok slideshows keep turning my images to the side or upside down. its really started to get on my nerves and I've done everything I can to fix all of these issues. overall insta reels are better🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️",0
"It's been about two weeks since I've been able to like videos. I've cleared the cache, reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, tried on my computer and on my old phone, but nothing works. I've reported the problem on the app several times now, but I've still got no answer.",0
"Been on this app since it was still musicaly and honestly I never had a problem until recently, for the past few days now I've been noticing that an ad will just randomly start playing in the middle of me watching a video and the first few times I thought I accidentally pressed refresh but since recent discovery that is not the case. Absolutely ridiculous. And to add a note I dont think children under the age of at least 13 should be able to access this app because its clearly not sensored.",0
"I have an Android phone and the app randomly crashes. This is the 3rd time it's happened. When I open the app and it flashes the black TikTok screen and closes. I tried to clear cache, restart my phone and once I had even waited upto 2 weeks, but nothing worked. It seems like there was an update on 11/03/2024 and today (12/03/2024) my app decides to crash. TikTok need to be more user friendly to Android users (Huawei p30). I've lost so many drafts and memorable videos that I'll never get back.",0
"I'm EXTREMELY upset at the fact this app gives us the option to disable contacts and yet SOMEHOW they STILL show up. I had to block everyone I recognized in order to avoid getting them to show up on my page. If I wanted to talk to them on this app, I WOULD ASK. It's very offputting this app decides on its own, even when you deny permission, to show IRL contacts to you.",0
"so far I've loved TikTok but then the photo slideshow is not there anymore and I can't post pictures without it automatically switching to video mode, I'd appreciate if you please look into it and add the photo mode back, and also it's media from my phone is not showing on my TikTok so i can't upload it and I checked all the permissions given to TikTok on my phone but still.",0
"It's entertaining, yet they need to start using the community guidelines in a fair sense. They don't enforce them in situations that desperately need to be enforced, and only enforce them in situations where it's not needed or wanted. It's quite annoying. So unless you don't plan on interacting with videos or talking to others, or even uploading your own content, it should be fine. If you want to though, I suggest you do it somewhere else, because it's out of hand and they never use it for right",0
"Good app overall but theres a bunch of little annoyances. It doesnt always show the date of the video im watching. I think that affects the algorithm of my prefs and potentially skews view counts cuz i have to refresh the vid a couple times. I don't mind a feed that varies uploaded dates, but id like to kno how old the vid is im engaging with. Also the live notifs still show me notifs for people i disable the notifs for. Whats the point in having this option if tiktok overrides it anyway?",0
Every other video the brightness changes to super bright for no reason. It only goes back to normal if I swipe past the video and go back to it. Ruins scrolling in low-light situations when it shines brighter than the sun,0
"The app keeps telling me ive edited my profile picture too many times. It's a new account. I've never set a profile picture. I also cant follow anyone back. Seems there are issues with the app, the app and samsung, or it's just badly created.",0
"This app was great until my child's account was getting banned for apparently being too young (he's 13) and when trying to appeal it said that the documents didn't meet the requirements and that his face didn't match up with his passport, but his passport shows his face of him a few years ago... He clearly would have looked different from that year to now. This review will change after a lot more appeals... We did everything you asked and still can't get back into his account. 😔😩👿",0
There a lot of Videos being recommended to me and with them clearly being viruses links that are just trying to scam people or if people want to see ice spice video to click on mysterious links. Definitely not okay if that just keeps showing up repeatedly over and over after few swipes.,0
"Live videos keep playing audio over other videos! Even when I exit the app... the only thing that stops it is force closing the app. Please fix this, it's really frustrating!",0
"I'm changing my 5 star to 2. This app has gone way downhill for creators in the past 3-4 years. It has become a skinner box. No rhyme or reason to views, fyp has more misses than hits showing me stuff I have 0 interest in. Accounts I have followed dissappear from fyp and my following feed just puts the 10-15 most recently followed accounts on shuffle. Its a shame. At least I'll be getting my free time back from this black hole of an app.",0
"Start to notice that once I enter the app, the videos will start to glitch or freeze. I thought it was my phone, but it's the app, and there are too many ads, so I can't even enjoy an hour without seeing like 15-25 ads",0
"THIS NEW TIK TOK STORY UPDATE IS SO BAD. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!!??? That concept works great for Instagram or Facebook but not for this platform. It feels like you are ruining user experince on purpose, I don't understand...these last few updates were abosolutely terrible. DO BETTER!! Or better yet, stop changing/ruining things that work well!!",0
App keep crashing when recording video as it slows down with unbearable use of the app and contuines to close when trying to make video or watch any tiktoks on Motorola e13 model and this happens to many time please fix this asap and I haven't make content for over 3 weeks because of this issue and I wish to keep making content on here,0
"Tried to sign up as a seller, application was denied because they ""couldn't verify identity"" when social, address, and photo ID were provided. Contacted support who asked for screenshots of the issue, when I replied to that email I received a do not reply and other garb. I have products to review and sell in the mail and no way to do it. Do better tiktok....",0
I love the app but I have been permanently banned for no reason I wasn't given one notification saying I did anything wrong and reached out all day no response besides contact a different email and then when I email them they told me to email the same email that sent me to them. I wish there was a way to call or have an associate to talk to to fix it faster since I didn't do anything wrong and you can't make a new account nor will they answer my appeals.,0
This app is such a distraction to the children and I've been watching since forever and what I noticed it has alot of adds and it's so annoying and also tik tok should not be watched by children . Tik tok is exciting to much for the children. They are not focusing in school and I think it should be not having adds but otherwise great app anyways.,0
The perfect app for when you feel like bricking your phone if you have any background apps open when you decide to use it. It's definitely frustrating to navigate around and use some of the more obtuse features.,0
"I can't post videos anymore. They glitch to only the first clip and just keeps repeating. I have tried just posting the video it saves to my phone, and that one just freezes. Please fix this. Tiktok also won't let me access all my photos to change my pfp and now I can't change it to what I want.",0
The edting in app is very laggy and will freeze after a time. There is no dark mode on android which is a absolute joke. The in app messaging is also very bad because even if i delete my message the other person is still able to see it,0
"Been using the app for a while and usually loved it but recently it removes sounds,glitches out,cant make videos smoothly cause the sound and video don't add up and I'm still watching then it kicks out saying ""tiktok runtime expired"" and now past few days refuses to update",0
Tiktok hasn't been able to open for some days now. It makes the open animation but swipes to the side and closes Update just a few min later: won't open AT ALL Edit: I uninstalled and it worked for a while but it's happening again. I need my drafts and idk what to do,0
"When its working, its fine. But every time there's an update it crashes on my phone. I have to uninstall and install it again and i never know when thats going to happen, one day it just stops working! 😤",0
Really wish it would stop force closing on me. I wish the search feature didn't freeze my whole phone. Wish the video would stop playing when I close my phone. The app has really went down hill the past month or two.,0
"this app has always been decent to me but for some reason whenever I post a video with my clips cropped they'd look squished, when I post slideshows the transparent texts wouldn't help covering a normal text, and sometimes texts wouldn't appear when I post a slideshow. Along with the fact that sometimes it would take like 20 minutes to upload a post and I don't really understand why, there's still a few more I have to say but overall this app is a meh",0
"It's an awful experience, recently I just can see Russian videos, I used to indicate that I'm not interested in that kind of content, but nothing happens, All the time, I only see Russian videos and is horrible.",0
"2022: Everytime l create a new account it gets deleted...for no reason and tt just sends u a message that they cant do anything abt it.... 2024: This app has been really good to meeee. But for some reason its not allowing me to open it any more, its like everytime l open it or try to ot doesn't allow me to. Its not like lm banned or anything its just it won't allow me to go into it. Its so weird but hopefully it will pass and js go back to normal 😕😔",0
"The adds are annoying, my for you page is full of weird things even tho I always click not interested and I don't like them, It's always laggy, when I make videos in capcut and post in on tiktok it completely ruins the quality of the video. Honestly just an annoying app and it's fun to watch videos on but I can't make any cause they're very laggy and it's Honestly annoying so I have to rate it 2 stars. Used to be a great app but the updates ruined it for me.",0
"I really like tiktok but when I search anything the first like 4 videos that pop up are about what the search was but after that, the videos aren't about anything what I searched, but something random. Also when I click on the second video of my search, there is a video before it but I can't scroll back, I have to click off of the video and click on the first one specifically. Tiktok really needs to fix that problem because I know a lot of people who are frustrated about it, but overall it's ok.",0
"It kicked me off my TikTok account, I literally can't get back in. It's not hacked or anything I checked. It just won't let me log in, takes forever to load after I press enter. Won't even send me a password change for the right account. I literally can't get back in and the app won't load completely or register me pressing the button to log in. It just keeps getting worse, more laggy, I wish reposts were capable of being put as only friends again. Wish I could comment on my reposts again.",0
You can watch lots of videos but sponsored ads and regular ads are mixed into the point that they count as regular ads. You can't really get through videos without it being more than half ads. It's definitely gone downhill very quickly. It used to be a lot of interesting content. Now everything seems to be taking you to the tik tok shop so that you can buy things suspiciously cheap. It makes me wary and feels like Temu which I would never give my card information to.,0
Tick tock is 100% profiting at the cost of people's identities health and safety. Cannot send an email because the email is not accepting emails. Hmm Is this why the federal government is involved with you guys You don't care about your app or identity theft. Or or even your app working correctly to the point where it's running in the background and you have to use the icon to stop it.,0
"Although the ability to have my messages filtered is nice, it would be significantly less annoying if it were actually possible to find and view the filtered message requests. It appears after doing an online search that nobody knows how to find them. Fix this, it is not user friendly.",0
Live videos won't stop playing even if I close the app. I'll quickly skip over one and it'll keep playing over the next video. I'll close the app and it will still play. I'll reopen it and it'll play over the new video,0
"This app needs a lot of work. the algorithm is not currently functioning properly, most people's videos are automatically labeled AI after uploading, and I have an issue with two accounts being linked to one email, which has gone completely ignored by support even though I've tried reaching out. They need a way for users to talk to a real person for account issues, especially since many spend real money on ADs and promoting.",0
"TikTok is a nice app, You can watch videos and create videos.. but half the time it either glitches or kicks you out, Or it will mute most of the videos on my profile and my FYP. How are some people allowed certain filters and other people arent? Different phones aren't allowed certain filters. This is VERY frustrating. When you first open the app most of the time it glitches and says ""TikTok is not responding please close the app and try again"" and it does this all the time. Please fix this..",0
"My repost button is suddenly gone. My friends still have the repost button, even when they update or reinstall the app. Ive tried updating the app but there is no luck, ive made new accounts on another new phone and it didnt work either. Ive tried contacting them for help or to fix it but its gone. Other poeple and see my reposts and it been a while so ive changed since then, the reposts arent like me anymore and i cant delete them or repost new videos to chnage them. Fix this immediatly please.",0
"Tiktok is great, but I don't have many updates that other friends have in this app.....I tried everything, and I had an excellent connection, and I tried updating the app but still didn't get the swipe photo thing in the camera, it didn't get the messages update which you can send messages to a friend on tiktok. I want these features in my tiktok account, so I want a solution to my complaint.",0
"It was good and I could find something interesting to watch but now almost every 2 swipes I am just hit with an Indian Tiktok video.Which would be fine if it wasn't just the same thing just from a different person over and over again. And it was actually interesting to watch, you're better off just watching YouTube Shorts as you can actually customize the content you watch there.",0
It's an okay app. It's not really my cup of tea and I don't use it often. But one thing that bothers me is when my friends send me a lot of tiktoks and everytime I reply to one I have to scroll alllll the way up to see the next one they sent me and it's very frustrating. I wish if you could click on the message you replied to and theyd automatically scroll up to that message so you dont have to scroll manually. That would make my experience much better.,0
"There have been some minor advances in the app, but there is still room for improvement in the editing UI. I was originally going to give 3 stars until I saw how long people have been waiting for dark mode to work on Android. What's the hold up?",0
"Since the update, I've been having trouble making videos. All the filters that I had saved are gone. And it won't let me search in the search bar to look for them. But on my second account, all the same filters are on there. And just stuff that was on there before ain't on there it's very weird TikTok, go back to the old update..",0
"I could not add pictures to my drafts. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Now, every time I click my profile, I get kicked out with a notification that the app is updating. I have automatic updates turned on... I find it hard to believe it's needed to update four times in 10 minutes.",0
"Everything is perfect but one thing that has annoyed me and overtaken me into giving it 2 stars is that the search facility is useless as a whole, even when I search the most precise things (keywords) the video I am looking for doesn't come, only the videos in my region shows up (with similar but different keywords), I am super annoyed with it",0
"I like the this App and i spent a lot of money but the ""help center"" is very bad. They don't reply when you send feedback and don't fix the issues. I have been complaining about my problems and glitch for 2 months, and they never gave me an answer or fixed the issues. Is really frustrating when you see your requests got expired before they reply you!!",0
"I really liked to watch videos on the is app but recently there are way too many live streams and ads. Really sad about this change, please add an opt-out off at least the live streams.... Spending less and less time using this app otherwise.",0
"I don't like how it's crashing, I made a special video to post and it took months to make it, so when I opened tiktok, and when I pressed the + button, it always kicks me out and it keeps on doing that. Pls fix the crashes it always bugs me.",0
"The app worked amazingly at first, I enjoyed it for a few weeks. However, while on a vacation to hongkong the app stopped working. At first, I thought this was normal as my other family members phone couldn't use tiktok and the fact I learned tiktok was banned there. However. When I returned back to Canada, the app wouldn't work anymore. However, my family members tiktok worked so I uninstalled it multiple times yet to no avail. Please fix this as I would like to use tiktok again. Thanks.",0
"I use this app most of the time but since yesterday, whenever i try to open the app it crashes. I am a small content creator on the app and I am very upset that i can no longer access it. Please fix this problem as i have seen many of the same problems for older android users and i would like to have my account back.",0
"The updates now are just useless aesthetic updates that make the app run worse and worse. They tried to add transition animations between windows and its glitchy, useless, and awful looking. I spend a lot of time on this app, but ever since the american servers have been added, its awful and only getting worse.",0
"Prolly steals my info but uses it to 'give me the content I like' nah, I watched on instagram the stuff I like and it still gave me stuff like gacha club, and when I was trying to use the camera on my device, it said 'the camera is being used by another app' so I closed tiktok and the camera started working. Proof that it's watching you. But if you don't mind that it's actually an app that's easy to use and when you search something it gives you good results, and that's why I added a star.",0
It takes a long long time to load and it freezes alot when I use a filter and try put a song on my video. Kids are starting to get the app and they are learning things they shouldn't know,0
"It was an awesome app, but now everytime I try to login it says ""maximum number of attempts reached, try again later"" .I just recently got the app after MONTHS and I don't even know why it's doing this so it looks like I can't even use this app. I was re logging in the publish and boost my YouTube account..",0
Does not give the option to block people and I'm constantly harassed on my videos but can't do anything about it Also why does the green screen filter go in and out? Sometimes it's missing,0
The new update is not longer installing on my device,0
I don't know of tiktok and android have each other I don't get every single detail notification and unlike iPhone when I click on a message it just takes me to the 3d bar option which is not cool instead of opening notification direct,0

Look tiktok I don't create my videos for you to mute them so what if a song isn't available I didn't have it in background when recording for nothing! Also I don't put the work in for my other creations like the one I have been trying to post for last couple hours just for you to mute it and I posted a video about that! Would be nice if you had a email to reach you but here everyone can see only 2 Stars for now,0

"Tik Tok is so boring and uninteresting. The livetreams ain't nothing but a dating platform because half the people who use Tik Tok only flirt with their favorite content creators, and it's so intoxicating . I would love to see the gov't shut down Tik Tok because that app is annoying 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬",0

"In the future, when we discuss the downfall of American society, I will definitively point to TikTok as a major contributing factor. With that being said I do like messing around on it and I even made a new lady friend that I could have met in person if I was the type to pay for it 🤣🤦🏼‍♂️",0

"This app can be my most used app at times, but lately videos audios will keep playing and leak into other videos and the only way to get it to stop is closing the app. Which is very annoying because I'll be trying to watch a video but can't understand what their saying, to close the app and never see the video again. Just cause a previous videos audio didn't cut out when prompted.",1
"It's a fun app, but some times if I accidentally hit to many buttons or like videos to fast, it will not allow me to like videos for many hours after. This gets very annoying. (Update, it just took away the 'not interested button', which is very upsetting since I used to use it to keep content I'm not comfortable with seeing away)",1
"For the last 2 years it's been telling me nonstop to ""connect to internet"" ""your connection isn't secure.."" when I'm literally connected to the internet and everything else is working! If I switch between apps,for a sec,I can't go back in to same video; wish u didn't have to save vids to my camera either..it's slow to load, too..it's been getting progressively worse no matter the updates ..",1
"Fine app. I use it a lot. One thing they to change. Please add a scroll feature! So many liked tiktoks I'm never gonna see again because there all the way at the bottom of the liked page. Or if that doesn't work, make it that you can search tiktoks or search a specific date that when you liked it.I don't know if you could make it work but if you can please add it!",1
"Not successful for my purpose. Microphone is off when sound is added. Every time I try to record on Tiktok, the mic is enabled, but soon as I add a library sound, the mic turns red for disable. Only option is voice over but the sound do not play in background while doing a voice over. Bottom line, I would like to sing or rap over a sound from the library but it won't let. Maybe its not allowed, but how are other artist uploading these type of tiktoks.",1
"The app isn't well formatted for all types of phones such as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3. When I am trying to see videos on the inside screen, some of the videos will only show on half of the screen, and opening the comments will do this to videos that are displayed normally. This issue cuts off a chunk of the video as well. They need to look into this to make it work better for more than just the average iPhone or Galaxy phones.",1
"Update: The app is still pretty good, but there's a persistent issue with logging into all my TikTok accounts. Whenever I log into an account on TikTok, it always says there's no internet connection or that I've exceeded the limit. I recently got a new phone, and it's still doing this with all my accounts, even though I've reset the passwords for them. Please fix this in the next update, or people won't be able to log into their accounts.",1
"Here lately any time I scroll past a live the audio will keep playing for a few seconds over the next videos audio and every now and then the lives audio will just continue to play even after scrolling a few times and even if I leave the app. The only way I can make it stop is to completely close the app. It's getting really annoying and frustrating especially if I wanted to actually watch a video that the audio interrupted, then it's a hassle getting back to that video",1
"It's a very great app with videos and music, I really enjoy. But as an android user, i think it's very dumb about the fact that there is no dark mode option. What's the point of giving iOS dark mode but not android? Some android users can go to the settings app and force it by turning on a third-person app display, but some android phones, including mine, can't do that either. I think there's no point in giving IOS dark mode and not android, please, and thank you so much!",1
"Greatness is but 1 bug fux away. Ignoring the steadily increasing amount of ads being shoved in my face as the platform tries to monetize itself, there is a really annoying live audio bug that seems to be ignored by the devs. Recently switching from iPhone I noticed that when I scroll post some live videos, the audio lingers and overlays on every subsequent video I scroll by. Even when I background the app I can still hear it. Only an app restart fixes the issue at times.",1
"Was working fine until the recent update. I've been having problems with commenting. When I try to post a comment it will randomly only post part of the comment, or if you hit the wrong person to reply to, your comment bar freezes up at the bottom of the screen and won't let you close it. Have to close and restart the app, and even after doing that, it still does it every time I want to comment on something.",1
"TikTok has many amazing creators but quite the horendous format in which they are displayed. I deleted the app many months ago for the same reason I am writing this review today. TikTok will not let you mute videos unless you pause them. There is a setting that has videos muted upon first opening the app, but you can't play any other audio on your phone. Once you unmute the videos, you can't undo the action. Please add a mute button. It is the bare minimum, and please, let us play our own music.",1
"I have loved this app ever since I downloaded it back in 2019, and I have probably used it far too much. But the most recent update that makes a ""pinwheel/spinning"" motion effect when you touch something like messages or settings makes the app so hard to keep going on. The transition takes way too long and gives me a headache. The app was a lot better without that effect. There should at least be a way to remove the effect or change it via the settings for people or are motion sick easily.",1
"I have had tiktok since it was released and ever since then I had no problems with the app. But now, as a content creator the filming is horrible. The sound is all messy, my videos are delayed sometimes and when I try to duet, it messes up completely. I've cleaned out storage and do anything I can think of but still no change when i film my videos. Edit (12/2/23): Tiktok has yet updated again. I wish it'll stop giving things just to take them away.",1
"Lots of entertaining videos and it's nice that anyone can post videos, however I wish photos would show up when searching for things and also videos look good when filming and previewing, but once posted, it becomes grainy and or blurry. Overall, it needs better quality, and you should be able to search for photos, not just videos. Edit: the transitions recently added were funny at first, but are EXTREMELY annoying and also makes me and others feel queasy.",1
"Have had tiktok for about 2 years now and never had a problem. Loved it. But for the problem started about a month ago, where there was an ad for some product that I was interested in, so I clicked on it. I didn't get it. I also clicked on 2 other ads. I bought one of those 2. Since then, every 3-5 videos is a review or ad for the other 2 products that I didn't buy. It's frustrating. I don't want them. And I don't know how to stop seeing the stupid repetitive ads and reviews",1
"Fair warning, this app is insanely addictive. I've had to uninstall it like 5 times just to keep myself off. I've noticed the algorithm is getting worse lately, it used to show me a large variety of content from lots of creators that I really liked. Now, it shows me the same few topics from the same 10 creators, even when I go out of my way to search things, like, and comment on other stuff that I actually want to see. Nope, doesn't matter. Same 2 or 3 topics instead of the variety I'd like.",1
Tiktok is great to watch short video or skits. The only problem I have is when you report a video and you click other it doesn't let you describe what is wrong with a video which is for me to report NO FLASH WARNING..... people who watch their videos don't expect flash in their videos all the time and go into a SEIZURE. When you click other it just wants you to select submit and be done with it instead of taking the actual time to read what a person has to say about the video what wrong with it,1
"It's little glitches I get after being on there for a little while (for me 10+hours) it used to be a live video every four videos now it's a live every two videos,sometimes three and it's getting out of hand. I know it shouldn't be that big of a deal but the lives be so unhinged,so abnormal and it's just getting on my nerves it's like basically an ad and I also have ads too but only some rarely times when I open the app. I just wish there was a feature where we can disable the lives.",1
"I love this app, it is so fun and I spend hours on it. When ever I have free time I always go in here. But there's been this bug. TikTok recently added a photo slide when you can manually swipe the photos. But my phone doesn't have that. And it's really annoying because a lot of other people can do it but I can't. TikTok please fix this bug.",1
"Frustrating and unfriendly user interface. This app does what it is meant to do on a base level, but it makes it very challenging to do basic things such as setting a default image for a video, and editing that image, or your caption and tags, after posting. A user shouldn't have to re-upload a video in order to edit those things.",1
"Constantly flooded with bots, content is repetitive. Would like a function to find real or even local/nearby people and content. Instead I get clones of real accounts following me, messaging me for information. There is no practicality in social function. The editing process is clunky. Could use extensions that provide more personalized control of the experience. Ads are also becoming more intrusive and annoying. Many more notes, but it is what it is. Safeguards could be better as well.",1
"Tiktok has a lot of good things as well as bad. They allow you to connect with others effectively. However, the app has some glitches. I.e Tiktok will not allow me to change my profile picture when it already has the permission. This is very problematic, as it gets in the way when posting videos. If Tiktok could update this problem, it'd be great.",1
"The algorithm is hit or miss. Either it reads you right and gives you everything you want or it gives you whatever they want you to see. Other than that, my only complaint is that when streaming on smart TVs and things like Chromecast, there is no audio leveling and I'm constantly changing the volume.",1
"I'm giving it 3 stars for a couple reasons,it lags alot and on the photo swipe videos the photos don't load at all.then the lives,every 2 times I swipe up there's a live and when I try to skip it it takes me to the live instead of skipping. Also,when I edit any of my videos the text does not show up when I press done,this app is entertaining but it does need some touch ups.",1
"Its all TEMU ads! The platform was alright until they made the store a central focus among other tweaks that were solutions looking for problems, but the quality of most videos has been getting worse and worse. AI voices reading everything, low resolution videos that still have the previous tiktok watermark, and 1 out of 10 videos telling me to download Temu. And once things start feeling fine, the algorithm decides to spam me with stuff I have never shown interest in and never will.",1
"Mostly good, enjoy fun facts and funny videos. My algorithm could be better. It used to be right on point but now all I see are new filters and stiktok shop videos it seems like. Yes I've done a good bit of shopping but that doesn't mean I wanna go to relax and watch ad videos. Also, they could 3ase up on the giving you bad points for cuss words, they are words... They express emphasisism when used correctly. Other than that it's good.",1
"It glitches a lot and there way too many adds, I go to swipe my 4th video and there's an add! Every 3-4 video u watch there is usually an add after. And I'm not a fan of how lives are shown on my fyp bc when I try to pause the video it always ends up being a live and then I just click on to the live, it's very annoying. But overall the app is pretty okay.",1
"If I had to rate a month ago, it'd be higher. WTH happened with this app? It's killing my battery, now it's constantly draining my cell and only way I can stop this is to delete the app (which I am very close to doing) All of a sudden, shows one ad after another & don't see the creators that I follow anymore. Also been freezing up & lagging so much, not worth the headaches right now. This is getting to be more annoying than enjoyable.",1
"I like it. But the advertising has gotten so bad. It's almost every other swipe. It's annoying. Wasn't like that in the beginning. I'm also starting to notice that when I like a video on a particular person's page and come back to that video later on, the like is no longer on there so you're having to press it again. Seems a little bit fishy to me because then feel like count isn't really authentic now is it? I started noticing this . And I go back to the exact same video.",1
"It's perfectly fine to watch content on, but for me, if I want to make any myself that involves any form of interactive filter, I can't. Since a more recent update all filters appear twice as big as normal making interacting with them next to impossible yet if I record a bit and watch that back the filter is shown to be as it's supposed to be so I'm not sure what that's all about but it needs fixing. Also, stop taking down the audios. You've even taken down one of me talking ffs.",1
"I love tiktok, like most people. However, the app crashes my phone every time to use it. I thought it was my phone at first, so I cleared everything up to memory, fastnest the lot, but the app always crashes the phone. I still use it as it only happens once, but it's frustrating as there is no other app like tiktok to use. Otherwise, I would download that instead.",1
"I like the app and the algorithm model, it works well and it stays relevant to what I like. However, it's currently taking up 15.3 GB of storage, I've seen it reach over 200 GB for others. No app needs to store that much data. The issue is that it downloads watched videos as part of the user data and rather than sending them to the cache and deleting them, it stores them in persistent storage. This issue was found at least 2 years ago and still hasn't been solved. Please fix this devs.",1
"Seriously!!! TikTok help please!!! I'm having trouble selecting images. Images are clearly in my gallery however when I go to select via tiktok to upload in video, I can't find them. I even moved relevant pic into separate folder on my phone, yet when I went to that folder via the upload on tiktok it says there are only 3 pictures in it! I've also been having issues selecting music, when I search for certain songs/artist I get karaoke versions only.",1
Love this app but I one thing I hate is that some features aren't available for everyone. I have tried everything to get photo mode to work and no matter what I do it's not available for me. It's available for friends in my area and every creator I follow. It's really frustrating because I'm a content creator myself and would like the opportunity to utilize these posts! There is no technical support either which is extremely frustrating,1
Every time this app updates it keeps crashing when I try to open it!! The only thing that fixes it is uninstalling and downloading it again but you end up loosing all your drafts when you do this. So infuriating can you fix this please. The app deserves 5 stars other than this issue. Edit: Yet again another update and I've to delete the app and loose everything 🤷🏻‍♀️,1
"Some of the pictures aren't loading . It'll load one, then I swipe to see the next one, and it's not working. I'll show a blank screen with the tiktok logo . I've uninstalled and checked for updates. Cleared data . Still nothing. It's very annoying, especially because most of my feed is pics .",1
"Yo, this is 5 stars. But you muted some really good videos. Occasionally, drafts will glitch out, and will no longer be accessible to edit or post. The loading percentage will always stop at the same number. Theres nothing you can do to recover the draft. The only option is to delete it. Please fix! But other than that, the app is still fun 👍",1
"TikTok is a really good app for sharing content and scrolling through endless entertaining videos with so many genres to choose from. My only complaint is— When I try to post a video, TikTok compresses it beyond any expectation. Even though my data saver is off, and even though i limit my video resolution to 1080p and post them with the ratio suitable for viewing standards, TikTok still proceeds to resize my video. Not just that, it crops my video by zooming in.",1
This application is amazing 😍 I did have come glitches happen while using the app For example when you press button record a video with a great sound player while the camera just is stock in the position and no on the camera app. This has never happened.This glitches has been occuring about one month and a half. Sometimes it work but not often . I herded ever record video anyway but I do however posts edited and it's work just fine. So it doesn't really brother me that . I love ❤️❤️❤️,1
The videos are excellent but difficult to control. They jump around all the time and don't give one a chance to plan what and how one wants to watch what's available. The concept Tik Tok has ìs great. They just need to tweak it until it's on par with other apps. I wish them well in their efforts!!,1
"So I've been using this app for a long time but recently I'm facing these issues that slide shows aren't playing music or sounds at all, and whenever I go and try to listen to the music by going to my favourite saved option or by tapping the music that is on the tiktok those musics don't get played. But those are getting played on the tiktok (not on the slideshow tho) but not when I tap it to listen to the full version or in my favourite collection. Whatever is happening please fix this fast.",1
"Great app, really entertaining and helped me get through lockdown in 2020. However, the last few updates have (personally) downgraded the app. I dislike the 10 min vids, I don't see the point in the longer videos (that's what yt is for) tik tok used to be a fun app to watch quick 15-30 sec vids on now its just like every other social media app. I have loads more I could say but sadly my limit is 500 words.",1
"after a while of using it, the app will crash whenever I try to open it. clearing cache or app data does not solve the issue, I have stable internet, enough storage on my device and the app is up to date. the first time this happened, I had to delete and reinstall the app, losing all my drafts i had saved. It's happened again.",1
"The newest update feels so unnecessary. The interface feels clunky and whenever I'm trying to repost something , it shows me a big list of my friends that cover up half of my screen. No one asked for that. The The previous interface was great already! Same with the video sliding up when going into the comments. It's not as annoying, but I think most people dislike it based on what l've seen people in the app itself say. Overall, the newest update feels very unnecessary.",1
"I'm pissy that it's hard to understand... I don't like that it self inserted music and then I don't know how to keep the original sound. That, and it's extremely overwhelming with the amount of things it does, like.... It... Uh- let's just say that it's not for people who can't keep up with the fast world. I'm sorry. I'm going back to Facebook and YouTube where old people live (btw I'm 22, it's just... I'm slow and I prefer slow)",1
I enjoy the app a lot but it's not working since the September 12th 2023 update!! :'( Edit: I uninstalled and reinstalled it and it worked for a while but now it's not working AGAIN!!! I'm losing all my drafts 😭 edit:everytime it updates I have to uninstall and reinstall it :(,1
"While the design for sending videos to friends keeps changing, which is honestly annoying, the worst part is the fact there's NO DARK MODE. NONE. I keep blinding my self every time I check on my notifications cause of how bright the damn app is.",1
Great app! It's just that I hate how i can not find the filters used in the videos anymore. I hope they bring back that feature where we can see the filter used right there above the username in the video. Apart from that's it's great so far!,1
"Love this app, but its really laggy for me and when I scroll by a live stream the live freezes my screen and when I exit the app I can still hear the live playing. And when I go to record a video my whole screen freezes. Please fix the issue!! Besides that, I really hope TikTok does not get banned.",1
"Today, the app is repeatedly crashing. I reinstalled and still have the same issue. I can view videos, but when I create a video of photo slides with few effects, it crashes when I hit NEXT to get to the hashtag page before publishing. I've tried and lost my work three times. Still doing it.",1
"It's a good app overall, and I've had it for years on different devices as I've got new ones, but with this phone, I have updated the app multiple times and have yet to have the slideshow option. Please look into it.",1
"It's fun and all but it glitches every second and every minute and every hour bro this app will test your patience I can't even post a video without it going out of the app or glitching I so tired honestly I'm thinking if deleting it the videos are amazing I know that bc I was using tik tok lite but the original how can you enjoy a video while it's glitching every time u try to watch it u can't even save a video without it glitching,lol tik tok lite is way better honestly",1
"Its a cool app but u started having issues daily. I cannot open the app no more, have to delete the app, restart the phone, install it again and then it works for about a day until i can not open it again. Thats very frustrating. Issues started about a week ago. I have a Huawei P30 Pro",1
"Fairly frustrated with trying to post- I just got a new phone and thought it would fix the error that occurs when attempting to save a draft. It definitely didn't, and once again I'm out over an hour of my time. Maybe this just isn't for me.",1
"It doesn't save the videos i like. Like if i refresh the liked videos section, it deletes my some of my liked videos(Not all). And this just suddenly started. I tried reinstalling the app, but it doesn't work.",1
"Updates Review : After a long use of the platform, i can say without a doubt that it does a great job at showing you content that you're interested in and show you other stuff you liked. My issue is how the app is managed. User selling, displayin and making ads for cheats etc... Blatantly ( Big words on their screen advertising it ) and other things against the TOS. Reporting those incidents will results in Nothing. Even with reviewing. But somehow get yourself warned for commenting on a vid",1
"The app is generally great. However, this most recent update has caused my comments to disappear and not come back until I uninstall and reinstall the app. And I don't mean every once in a while. It'll happen at least every other hour or so..",1
"I'm changing my rating,and giving 3 stars. Here's why. For 5 years I've been using tiktok. Alot changes over 5 years. Yes I still use the app,but the updates,and at times issues while in the app where nothing is accessible. It makes the app very untolerable. When the app is working it does its purpose and is very entertaining to use. That's why there's 3 stars. Do better.",1
"Hello, I give 3 stars for this app for reasons, 1- Community Guildness warning for no reason: I didn't know that saying were you get the video on it recives this, like ""On Youtube, just search 3 |Number lore"", I keep receiving recently! For no reason! 2- Even an art, an ART I get community guildness warning for no reason! The art has nothing bad on it, it just makes me feel that this is the worst app you can get! Please.. stop giving warnings for no reason.",1
"My videos keep glitching out and restarting without warning and keep doing so, making the videos it happens to unwatchable. Not to mention the frequent fraudbots, scam shop posts, and (these are STILL a problem yall havent cracked down on)literal $3×bots on this app that SOMEHOW MAKE IT TO MY FEED, I DONT WANT THAT ON MY SCREEN!",1
"Tiktok is a very good app, I enjoy it very much! But there are somethings that are overbearing, I cannot create a playlist no matter how Many times I update the app and even though only the lucky ones get to be viral the flopping is too much!! Ive been on this app for three years plus and each and everyone of my videos flop! Honestly I think its time to uninstall lol but apart from this tiktok is a great app!",1
The app has been great since I downloaded it. But for a while now I can't watch videos properly!They are stopping and when I get out of the app the sound from the video keeps playing. It's so frustrating especially when I use it so much. I would be grateful if you fix the issue,1
"So I gave the app 3 stars because of its preference of Apples' devices over any other brand for insance the new features are added there first and one of essentials features that almost every app have that is the dark mode is not avialable for all phones ,thus the app is good then if improved it will be almost the best media app in my opinion so I hope such small improvements won't take long.",1
"Awesome the fact that ads don't pop up a lot is amazing keep up the good work :) - Edit, 2023, oct 9 mon, I am way older now lol but uhm this has quite a few ads, and it's quite annoying, but overall tiktok is fun the people on it is fun to hang out with (if you don't get on tiktoks bad side) but yeah (also l wrote the first paragraph when l was 10 so uh)",1
"The app is useful and fun but I don't ever get updates and I've had multiple problems in the past were I've had to re-download the app because it wasn't opening. I can tell other people are having this problem and we all have one thing in common, a HUAWEI phone. Do better :)",1
"So I love TikTok it's a great app but recently there was an update and now the screen spins when I push tabs in the tiktok shop?! Uhm absolutely not the screen shifts when I click into my profile as well as individual chats. Edit: So turns out tiktok added ""transitions"" to the tiktok actions and there is no way to turn it off it's absolutely horrible it hurts my eyes.",1
"The app works smoothly, and everything looks good. But it's really annoying that after years Android users still can't use the app on dark mode. It was added on Apple around four years ago and we are still waiting, it really makes no sense. I hope it won't take much longer until we get access to such a simple option.",1
"The app kept crashing so I uninstalled and reinstalled it, now it seems to be working ok but the sound has been massively reduced. I've checked before you ask, it's not my phone, it's only happening on this app.",1
"I enjoy the app but with the current system for algorithm, my videos no longer get the amount of views as before, not even from my followers, which is a bit disheartening. However my biggest issue is it also messed up my FYP with content I DONT even like or care about, all the content I do enjoy I have to specifically search in order to watch. So the FYP is NO LONGER a ""For You Page"" if it's giving content the user has 0 interest in, no matter the like or interactions with content they DO enjoy.",1
likes to act up doesn't like to scroll doesn't like to close it doesn't respond with the buttons to well it needs some work done with adjustments to the button mods to work when you select them and the scrolling is the same non responsive when swiped music still plays when the app is closed,1
It's great I love it. But i can't get rid of repost notifications and it's so annoying. When I'm trying to respond to notifications I get I can't find them all I can see is someone liked my repost or someone reposted the same video as you. Its so annoying.,1
"Not sure when it started but the algorithm is using cached data to feed you the next video. We're talking about accounts you follow. The catch is your cache data is outdated, so you don't see your followers new videos or the time line is bad. Not sure how you plan on fixing using outdated cache data vs actual server pulls to supply your users with fresh correct content. This app is starting to be a very poor experience for every user.",1
"It's not that good I just go up there to look at interesting tiktok videos so really nothing wrong but it is kinda laggy and the video editing doesn't work at all I wouldn't say it doesn't work but it isn't really appreciative so I would say put in a work on that video editing. Also about the lagging it's a pain to try and look at the video. And when the videos are laggy I can barely even scroll. But, all I know is that it's not that good of a app and I do appreciate this app.",1
"It has been a nice app however recently, it's becoming so RAM GREEDY ,uses almost 2 GB ram to startup, random crashes, Secondly is twice as data consuming as before . Phone freezes on opening it. Sound library is not that appealing too. It's lite version seems to work smoothly than the original.",1
"Keeps lagging and glitching, sometimes the audio keeps going when I switch my apps or turn off my phone, honestly yeah I feel like I'd be better off on a different entertainment app, but oh well.",1
It's been a year using this entertainment app for me till my last update it's good but suddenly I updated my TikTok app last day before after that now when I add a favorite song... It's not showing on favorite list I try many times but it's not happening.. Please do fix this issue 😔😔,1
"Used to be 5 stars but every other day it's asking for an update and videos keep crashing. Useless when I get interested in a video and the app crashes and restarts. Doing another update which makes 3 in 6 days. I'm about to just go back to YouTube and forget this app. Update: right after latest update, watched 3 videos and crashed again! Another update 3 days later on 6/14.",1
"I'm trying to duet videos, but the video and audio keep lagging during the playback. idk this has been happening for years, and I don't know how to fix it. Because of it, the end result, my half of the video isn't synced to the dueted one and I can't edit because it's a duet.",1
"It is a good app but for some reason they always want to take and mute music I use or silence it saying copy right but I notated in the video that I do not own the rights, etc. I do not see anyone else's videos being muted when they use music/songs that they don't and they do not notate or give credit. I think I am being singled out.",1
"Tik tok has removed a lot of their translate features, I used to be able to see videos in other languages, and tiktok would have the auto translate features in their closed captions.. I really wish they would bring that back. Don't understand why they would get rid of it. Better experience recommendation is to offer the user to see what language videos they want to see (checkbox all that apply) and then develop translate features.",1
"A really good social media app, however on android devices it doesn't have dark mode and does hurt my eyes when watching at night. I know Apple devices have dark mode so why can't android do the same as this is the only app that hasn't developed it. Would be much better if it had dark mode! And would rate it a 5 stars",1
"Hey Great App but my only issues is kindly make it possible for users be able to control who can view their followers list. ie. Setting privacy to only Followers, me only or mutual followers or whatever. Similar to what other apps have that is only able to see mutual followers. That will make sense. Otherwise people will just be texting people from others list without their consent and it's very bad! It's not just about blocking such people, just kindly do something about it ASAP.",1
"The main reason I rated TikTok three stars is due to the lack of dark mode accessibility on Android devices. It's surprising that such a popular app has not yet implemented this feature, especially considering the strain on the eyes when using the app late at night. I believe adding a dark mode option would greatly improve the user experience and make TikTok more accessible to everyone, regardless of the time of day they use it.",1
"I love to watch YouTube but lately there has been too many ads especially in the middle of the videos and it's making me not want to watch YouTube, as the ads aren't relevant and they are very repetitive. not happy at all",1
Ok. It's a good app. It's fun to post on and watch lives. But I no longer get notifications from lives that I set for every live to give me a notification. On one of my accounts it didn't even show ppl were going live and when they were live it never showed. When I join in the app it won't let me like the first vid I see and if I try to text someone I have to leave the app cause all the messages are tubbled up and backwards.,1
"This app has banned me multiple times with no reasoning. It has also let inappropriate things go thru its moderation BUT it will give a warning for a slight bit of blood. I got banned twice with no warnings on my account. Once with one warning. It's very unfair to many content creators. But, the app can help you find out about more stuff. And it can help past time. Would rate higher if they treated all accounts fairly.",1
Okay for some reason it would not post the video when I'm done making one. Instead it would go into my drafts. Also when I press the middle button on the bottom my phone would end up crashing😑.,1
"Great app, lots of people and good recommendation feed. I would like them to add the slideshow to the Google pixel platform. It really irritates me knowing that I don't have it and I have to use the video slideshow. But other than that, great app!",1
"It's a great app, although it's weird how some features aren't accessible. I've compared two of the same phones, one can post slideshows and the other can't. Would be cool if all the features were accessible on all devices. Great app overall! Gets the job done.",1
"Hello TikTok team I'm writing this to adress an issue with my account. I believe that my account has been freezed. The reason for this seams to recommend to other in their foryou and explore. To help you understand my problem,I've attached a screenshots below I kindly request your assistance in reviewing my issue. your kind attention would be greatly, thank you 🤗",1
"Would be perfect but I have had this on all my accounts unistalled than reinstalled tiktok, turnt my phone off completely yet its still not showing I followed ppl, I have followed loads and my following count is still 0, they need to fix this bug since I'm debating going to shorts 🤣",1
"It's a good app, but you can get easily addicted and it can really shorten your attention span. Also, tiktok can randomly ban for no reason, and it can be hard to make another account.",1
"The app used to be fun, but it seems like the only thing on it anymore are scam sight ads or bots trying to sell you on something. The tik tok shop is cool, and honestly, the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1.",1
"This app is an amazing thing you can follow people that you want and like,you can also get loads of people followed by you and even tho its buggy its still cool Download now! 7/11/22 tiktok will not let me gonnonto my other accounts it says ""too many attempts ""even if its my first time trying... FIX IT TIKTOK 30/3/24 im back 2 years later and we want the photo swipe back",1
"This app is great, I dont really have any issues except it is glitching... so... bad. My comments are freezing so that i cant get out unless i exit the app, my comments are sending 4 times?? Whenever i open a video someone sends me it has these weird transitions. It is really irritating to have to deal with😖",1
"Navigation is still confusing, and there aren't enough simple options for editing existing videos (like mirroring). Slow. Too many fake accounts and spammers.",1
"Love it but the automatic captioning overlaid over all videos disappeared, and the option to toggle this on disappeared from the accessibility settings! This has been really detrimental to my user experience. I submitted a ticket over a month ago and have received no response.",1
"Am having serious problems with this tiktok app, infact an giving up. How can someone post videos and the videos don't go viral & this happens every time. I started using this app over 3yrs now, but non of my videos have reached 1000 views, but other people keep having a lot of views. Why is my own different. I have done all I could, every time I keep resetting the app, but the same thing keeps happening. Infact, am done with this app. Pls @tiktok make my videos go viral. Thank you😊",1
It's a great app. It just would sure be a lot better if they didn't always remove the music quote to copyright reasons. If that's the case then why do you offer that sound on your sound options to put as a background music to the videos or pictures?,1
"Resend bug is that a lot of time I will lap on the app on my home screen and it just refures to open it will make the animation that it's opening but then only flash a white screen and immediately close this does not happen with my other apps sometime I have to restart my phone just to get it to open once other that on my Android phone making tiktiks is completly impossible and the app kept crashing so I just gave up and only which otherwise I do enjoy the app, good app @mandialye",1
"I love tiktok so much it's a great app,and the fact that you can get instant views a few seconds after posting. But I really wish you could create on option where it tells me whether your video is eligible for the fyp or not before posting not after,it takes up so much data Editing in the tiktok app is wack as well...It really hurts being told your vid is not eligible for the fyp after hours of editing",1
"Way to many ads and can you for the love of god add a mute button. Update: thank you for allowing the app to be opened muted but i would still like to see a mute button. Also please send ""live"" video feeds to their own tab. I hate having ""live"" feeds pop up on my FYP. Now i see more ads then before. Please make it so you can opt put from ads.",1
"There is no picture in picture, background audio, or any way to play a video in the background. Some people would like to go out of tik Tok and do other things but still listen to videos. But I guess that's too advanced.",1
"amazing, but, I wish there were more options to this app, and more space to watching videos. and I have a big problem; tiktok keeps on not letting me open the app. it closes whenever I open it-I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it, it worked but bam, it happened again. dissapointed.",1
"I got the new update today and it keeps saying ""in tapping too fast"" even tho I'm not. I had to delete the app (and lost all 100+ drafts) to see if it would work with the tapping issue and it did not. I risk my drafts for absolutely nothing.",1
"It's fun and a nice app to scroll on when I'm bored but lately these updates are getting a bit out of hand. Taking out the front flash, which everyone used and adding random commas? And don't get me started on them removing all of the sounds. They also made videos sit on top of the comments, and it's just annoying in general. I'll still use it but if I get more of these dumb updates I'm uninstalling and moving over to ig reels.",1
"Look i enjoy the app as much as anyone else but you can't tell it your screens aspect ratio, so people like me with tall thin phones get the sides of videos cut off with no way to fix - this has since been fixed, yay. Why are comment threads not a timeline? It's so difficult to read a discussion - menu transitions try and do like 3 different animations at once and it looks awful",1
"even though this review will be kinda useless for play store, im writing this for a friend: please fix the following tab issue! ive seen many people complain that its gone and no one knows how to fix it, its the fact that its gone and no one knows why. my friend uses an iPhone so it may be different depending on the OS. I personally havent got an issue with the following tab but im here to tell you that there is an issue with it. other than that, this app is mid, 3 stars :p",1
"It's a great app actually, but lately I've been facing some problems such as, whenever I'm editing my bio or try to edit my bio, it says tiktok isn't responding or tiktok has stopped which is really really annoying cuz i can't edit my bio, and secondly whenever i send a message to someone it goes to them aster a while which is also annoying, please fix these things if you want me to give you a five star.",1
"Very entertaining and monetizing app, but please differentiate between friends, followers and following. Friends shouldn't be included in following. We have to be able to go through following list without seeing those we're friends with. I'll drop another star if it's upgraded. 🤩",1
"Hi there ticktock, I must say this is a good app, but on the honor phones, basically I opened ticktock, and I couldn't faviroute any videos so I went to the play store and updated it, I went to open it again, and it would show me the loading screen then kick me out. Just un-installed and re-installed it, I can now get in, but I still can't faviroute videos! I've checked Google play for any updates, but my app is all up to date, please fix this!",1
I wanted to look through someone's reposts but when I check it didn't show the repost icon 😭😭 Everytime I uninstall and reinstall it'll show up but when I reopen the app it just stops showing it.. I'm on my 6th reinstall rn. Tiktok would usually take away features I would usually have for some odd reason and it's hella dumb,1
It's okay for the most part but suffering from chronic migraines my phone has everything in dark mode except for this app because it doesn't offer it. I recently switched from apple to android and just a bit disappointed that tiktok doesn't have dark mode on Android. Definitely should bring it back or update it to allow dark mode.,1
"I've been on this app since 2021 I must say it doesn't get worse nor boring but there are some inappropriate videos but I really enjoy this app but it has problems with ""Copyrighted"" sounds/music. I know UMG has a problem but I hope the sounds/music comes back may not sooner but later",1
"I had to create a new account with my current phone number bc my original account was linked to a phone number I no longer have access to. No big deal. But now when I try to follow people back, it doesn't show that I followed them back and I end up following the same people multiple times to the point where I get put in ""tiktok jail"" for liking too many people at once. Idk if this has anything to do with the new update, but it's very discouraging when I'm trying to rebuild my account.",1
"3 stars. Only because when I try to log in/sign up it ALWAYS says ""max amount try again later"" even though I only try it twice, it does get annoying so can you please fix this?? And another issue is that when I'm signing up it says ""enter valid user"" or smth like that and I go to fix my user even though it show the check next to it so I don't really know what to do when I'm signing up and it says this (NOTE) I will update this when I make my account to see if anything here has changed!",1
"2.13.24 Y'all seriously made it worse! We don't need these blinding transitions just to go into notifications. Just stop! 12.23.23 What in the world did y'all do with this most recent update? The crazy, unnecessary extra movements/ transitions are annoying! I promise there's plenty of visual stuff going on! I wish I could undo the update!",1
It's so annoying when I'm watching something on tik tok and message Pops up and asking for to on your location and give no choice to skip it. We should have the choice to choose whether we want that option or not.!!!!,1
"The app often crashes and becomes slow after using it for a while despite my phone being overall fast. There are too much ads every 2 or 3 videos. Although it's quite a good app, not really recommended since it's very addictive.",1
"Annoying most times. Takes time for stuff to load. My network is good but I'd be watching a video and it will just stop as if it's loading but it never loads. I have to scroll up or down, come back to the video then forward it to the place I stopped before it continues.",1
"I have an Android phone. Sometimes when I open the program, the main screen of Tik Tok appears to me, and after that it takes me out, and I can't open it again until I delete it and download it, and this is a problem that bothers me a lot. This happened to me 3 times, and here I am, downloading it. I said I would say maybe the problem will be solved",1
"While I was watching my videos, all of a sudden my for you page turned into something called ""restricted mode"", I don't know why they did this, but Tik Tok please fix this. It is incredibly annoying, because I can't look at my following, lives, the Tik Tok shop, or search anything. And everytime I try to log in to a different account, it asked me for a passcode that they never told me about because of the restricted mode. Tik Tok please fix this it is incredibly annoying.",1
"I really enjoy this app normally, but recently the new videos of a channel I follow don't show up in my feed. I've checked with the person who runs the channel and they said they don't see any reason why that would happen. I've updated the app and tried refreshing, but still nothing.",1
"Good experience but the Lives keep on glitching and it repeats itself and loads and never stops, I keep getting so annoyed because I have to exit of the app and go back in only for it to work for 4 minutes and glitch again. This bug is so annoying so please fix it <3",1
I would given it more but with the live stream feature is a bit questionable as it started kicking me off due to inactivity even though there's always something happening. Something needs to be fix quick as this is beyond annoying me and creators alike. Sort it out!,1
I can't believe you're moving all the music like this is what made her up if it's for copy right purposes but still you still remember that music and now most of our edits are going to be playing and now it's going to be so plain and it's good on our videos are just going to look stupid and it's just going to be no sound at all okay so yeah all of the background noises so wow how do you like it how do you like how people are getting mad at you .,1
"Besides what happened with Universal Music, with the latest update, the title I choose to show, doesn't show at the end of the upload, besides that everything is good, please fix these 2 things, it's irritating.",1
"While the app is great it can be difficult to use. I wish it could detect when your wearing a mask on certain filters, but other than that it's good. Edit: my videos keep glitching and its annoying 2nd edit: I want music back damn it",1
"Highly entertaining & addictive, I've noticed something suspicious lately though 🧐. I will be in another app, and tiktok will randomly take over my screen. It happens in the blink of an eye, but you don't notice it if you're always on tiktok.",1

I had this app for about 3-4 years now and don't get me wrong it's great and entertaining especially cause you get to choose what you want to watch and have lots of options for videos your for you page your profile etc... but i still don't have slideshows???!! Like i always want to use them plus anyone who uses them is always viral like it's not fair i just get effects like? Anyway please give me SLIDESHOWS!!🙏🏻 Overal i rate this app 3.5/5 stars thanks for reading!,1
"Love the app but having an issue seeing the content creaters I follow. Can only see that section if I sign in and out of the app. I have to do this evertime since I had the update. Tried restarting my phone, Uninstaller and reinstalled. Doesn't work. Really annoying",1
"The comments have been effing irritating! I either can't post a comment or when I do half the sentence is gone and it spam posts it. I deleted the app, redownloaded it with no change of the bug. Sometimes I have to add the video to my favorites then access my favourites in order to post a comment at all.",1
"Honestly I like watching tiktok and the videos are so cool, but there are tons of complaints. First of all I can't fund my REPOST BUTTON. This is very annoying 😑 also I can't even send messages on tiktok even though u did nothing, I can't even find the msg button also. Plz I'm to check this out... I'm very upset at this point.. like what's the use of using tiktok 😒. One more thing I don't have the button to like... select emojis... there are only 5 emojis I'm using.. tysm",1
"This app was much better before they decided that every time my contacts publicly shared a video that it should register as a private message. All that did was ensure that I will NEVER see actual private messages. What a silly, boneheaded change!",1
"Still frustrated that it won't fix phone number issues. Seemingly, another ""Chinese communication"" issue, as with crypto, bandlab, et al. Regardless, as 2024 starts, tiktok is the most functional social and business tool.",1
"I hate that they try new arrangements in the buttons, me as autistic i like how is always or if it easier. The new update for sharing is horrible, the friends icon its too big unnecessary. And for sharing to other apps i need everytime choose other because it will only save 2 app on the fast share.",1
"Been a user for 4 years. It's a shame that the updates don't improve the app. First they deleted the option to pin comments, then they changed the fonts, and the repost button. No one had a problem with those things, why change it? The most annoying thing though, is the report system. Tiktok takes down videos and comments that don't deserve it, yet they can't find violations in the videos I report, which clearly go against the violations. Please fix this, to keep your app and its users safe.",1
"Update has ruined the app yet again. Several of these updates have caused my app to break, the app will not open passed the tiktok logo and force closes every time. This is maybe the 5th update to cause this issue. No idea how long it will be this time before I can use the app again.",1
This is a very great app but it is very stressful when I enter the app and I tried to watch something or edit some videos it's just kick's me out like it's very stressful and I have been dealing with it for some time now and I don't know if it's glitching but other than that the app is great it has very funny videos and I love that,1
sound on videos has been notoriously spotty. like new videos that don't have music and are just the creators voices are muted for me. I've cleared my cache and restarted. also some videos that I watched are not visible even though the creator has not deleted or changed video privacy. super buggy,1
"Idm the app, but the repost button is gone, and it's really starting to bug me, and my sideshow keeps stopping at 5% or 0% when I upload it. I keep having to delete tiktok so I can go on my other account or post another video all bc the slideshow won't post😭😭😭",1
"This latest update has now made the gift goal banner for viewers unable to close & this issue here is if guest boxes are in use, the viewers then CANNOT see the chat to properly engage. PLEASE FIX THIS. that banner has the ""x"" to close, but it won't close for nothing. Frustrating",1
"Great app, but I do have many problems. Photo mode keeps on dissapearing. I've restarted my phone, checked for updates, updates my phone but nothing has worked, and I've tried several other ways, it's still doesn't work! Another problem, is that sounds have been removed for copyright issues, but I disagree with this, because I can not use any sounds whatsoever, so I can't make a good tiktok video, this gets very annoying and I need this to be fixed, ASAP! Thanks! (Edit)",1
I had the app before then suddenly it stopped working and just loading and loading I decided to uninstall it and install it back but still the same thing. Please can you help me to fix my tiktok back. Thank you 🙏,1
"Keeps logging me out and saying to try a different method no matter the method I pick to log back in with. I go thru this every couple days and it's getting old and becomes a ""process"" to even access any content. Finally did get a shop approved at least!",1
"Not good at all. Each time I try to create a video post, something would go wrong and mess up my work. I downloaded the app using wifi connection so I'm not sure if all the features are in place",1
"TikToks new story update is absolutely AWFUL⚠️ The app is still okay, but what the flip happened to stories? And why doesn't the like-count go up when someone likes my stories, THEY'RE STILL LIKES!??!? Can you just go back to the old srories.",1
Personally my tiktok is always hanging and i have very good data and when i scroll to another page i will still be hearing the sound of the previous page and it is annoying and also some videos should please be banned from tiktok or ban their page how can i open tiktok to be seeing one person flashing us with their bikin it is so annoying i think that is most of it i have uninstalled tiktok so many times and installed it back and it is so annoyin like what am doing at has taken so long,1
"I'm close to giving it 2x & make it Both photos & video centered Not just photos. I legit use TIKTOK to ask any questions,cos it replies with video, which Google doesnt & youtube is faraway. Bcos of its IG(photos), Youtube(talk to camera & edits) & google(ask anything) feature- while still keeping you creative & noticed, but now, best way to be noticed is via Photos, how many swipe do i need to do, to post a detailed recipe?",1
Only thing letting this down is not being able to filter on friends or following. That way if not being followed back you can see them all in order rather than have to scroll through 1000s of friends or following,1
This app used to be great and had good sounds then they went and took have the sounds out thinking that it would be ok I had half my drafts and videos with sounds that they deleted and it really gets on my nerves.,1
"It's an alright app but the age banning system is stupid because I have been banned twice because it said I was under 13 and to save the account I need an ID, driver's license, or passport (I have neither of the three) and there is certain ages in between the drivers license age and 13 and there's nothing you can do to save it other than a passport which idk the age on",1
I got a new phone a while back and the favorite button is gone. I can't even make a favorite folder or anything I can only favorite sounds and that's it. It frustrating and I just want to have favorites again.,1
"I used to live this app and it was my go to when I was bored or sad. I don't know what's up with this phone discrimination, but I have a Google pixel 7, and I cannot use most filters at all. This really annoys me and I wish it could just be like before when this didn't happen.",1
The brightness fluctuates randomly through tiktok. Instagram did this. It's a method to keep you from dosing off while scrolling. Keeps you on the app longer. Hope it helps,1
"I'd really like if Tiktok had dark mode for android users, like it's not even fair anymore, It's been 3 years man. On top of the fact Tiktok can randomly glitch out and its super annoying.",1
"The app is really amazing and I've been using it for years now. My only issue presently with the application is not being able to schedule contents as a content creator and a business owner. Sometime devices may not be available at the right time for contents posting, if this feature is added I believe it's gonna be one hell of an app for creators and business owners to enjoy. Thanks. Best regards, Odaf",1
"I personally use this app on a daily bases and it's really easy to post on, however it is soooooo slow which makes YouTube shorts better by like 110%, and I always get creeps massaging me, and when you report someone they don't get banned, and sometimes people get banned for no reason, it's honestly not really worth people's time, and people scroll on it for way to long~",1
"This app is entertaining. But despite the fact that tiktok is updated, and I live in the same region as others who use new filters, I am never able to see, find, or use those filters.",1
"I really enjoy tiktok, it's a great way to fill up free time. But I'm constantly having this glitch where my tiktok is stuck at an old version. My repost button disappears then turns up randomly which I find is really annoying and I'm missing alot of features. I've tried updating which hasn't worked and I've also tried reporting it as a problem but nothing happened. I'd would really appreciate if you fixer this.",1
"Entertaining but mindless stuff mostly a waste of time (we only have so much on this earth, why waste it on tiktok just food 4 thought) but the algorithm gets tiring after a while showing me the same type (sometimes exactly the same vids!) Over n over.",1
"I like TikTok. I have an issue though where it says that you can edit the caption and then the next day it says you can't edit it and I don't know why. Can you help me fix it pretty please? I also would love it if you add a feature to where you can change your pictures, videos and the songs after it's posted.",1
App is problematic and poorly managed and moderated. Videos of explicit content especially involving minors are prevelant whereas creators will get videos taken down or accounts removed for doing literally nothing or simply showing a brief second of a weapon in a not dangerous context. Not to mention recently they have started a program which allows creators to buy views and subscribes through promotions. This will no doubt destroy the integrity of the app and my enjoyment of it.,1
Most of the time when i open the app it completely glitches out my phone to the point it don't want to turn off when i press the power button multiple times. Another thing is that the room for characters in the comments section is sometimes annoying because an opinion is bigger than the character limit resulting in me deleting the entire comment because that said opinion can't be summarized withought crucial details missing,1
I can't create a slideshow for some reason? Even though i have the latest version aswell as i chose multiple photos. The overall experience is alright besides that problem.,1
"Tiktok is a great app, however there's a lot of bugs on it. For example, sometimes my/my friend's direct messages don't show up for eachother. I don't know what causes this, or how to fix it, but i know it's very annoying. I really don't like when i send a message, that is visible from my device, but ISN'T available on my friend's device. It goes both ways. TikTok, please fix this issue.",1
"Overall a good experience, but every three months or so, TikTok will start crashing when I try to open it and it's very frustrating because I have to reinstall it every now and then.",1
"There is always an issue of like and follow, I have reported it several times but no response, it's really a rude behavior for such a popular platform. I request from tiktok team to kindly look over this matter and resolve the issue of the likes and follows. Whenever I like or follow someone it doesn't added to my followers list. Hope team tiktok will take it seriously. Thank you.",1
"Love the app, but everytime I tap not interested on a video it gives me more like them instead of less. Also, it's overrun by bots liking and commenting under any comment I make, and trying to follow me. I'm sick of this algorithm issue. Also WAY too many tiktok shop ads now",1
"Love tiktok, amazing app. But seriously, where is the slideshow option?! 😭 I haven't had access to making a slideshow for months and it's slowly sending me loopy ;-;",1
I do love this app been using it since it was musically into tiktok but I hate they've changed the camera when recording on android it looks very zoomed in and off centre when it didn't use to be must of been the new update but it makes the videos look off because of it. (I have a huawei p30 pro),1
I would rate higher but when I edit my vids with text and choose a color no color pops up it depends on what color and it'll turn white or black and I really liked using colors and other people that I've seen on they're vids has the colors.,1
"Almost every single time this app updates (bug fixes and whatnot), it refuses to open on my phone, clearing cache won't help and restarting does not work. Each time, I need to re-install the app no matter what. Another issue is that hateful behaviour is allowed, despite terms and conditions. Multiple times I've reported genuinely awful stuff being said, only to be multiple times ignored despite the clear violation. Otherwise app is fine, good to pass time.",1
"It keeps crashing , ain't uploading nothing. Even it crashes and stops working everytime I open then app. It has logged me out several times.",1
It's a really good app for fun and giggles but there's a lot of content that is absolutely a no go for me. Tiktok certainly entertained me for a really long while and it still does depending on its content.,1
"its a great app if you want to get over your boredom or just want to have fun and scroll through videos, but i have a problem and i think its only for me. i had tiktok from the first time i got this phone and never deleted it. but i had to delete it yesterday and since then, when i open the app it automatically kicks me out a few mins later. how do i solve this?",1
"I love the app it's great but I've recently had a problem with following people, it says I do follow the person but when I click their account it says follow this creator and when I refresh my account it goes back to the original number it was before Update 1: now I can't favorite or unfavorite videos Update 2: app was great until sounds started to get muted",1
"On a side note there appears to be severe censorship and 1st amendment violations The problem I have with terms and services #5 bullet six, second half. Is that if im doing it you can't stop me, because im bypassing what you're using to stop me lol. and you may not even know how it's being done... it's not worth it for me not interested in the app anyway",1
Amazing app but 3 stars for this reason. Tik tok is a music app yes? Well as of this comment tik Tok is not renewing their license for music and will be muting millions of videos that have music which is so stupid. Tik tok will really no longer be a music app and a lot of people are wanting to delete tik tok for this reason.,1
"Wow so good app but there is so much bug network issue and so much bugs and in draft my vedio is not downloading and when i post my vedio it only seems 99•/• but it is not posted so fixed it soonly i am not alone which is this problems is facing in nepal tiktok is banded but we don't have any suitable and comfortable vpn so, tiktok will be better than past so good luck",1
They only give specific people certain updates and editing things they only give people with high views those things. I've never gotten the photo swipe mode it's not fair to anyone. Don't recommend this app.,1
"The editor can glitch out at times. Videos are never fully viewable for samsung z fold 5 anymore. No matter if the chat is open or flipped. it's always cropped somewhere now, and i can't even zoom out.",1
"I can't with the constant disappearance of features I was using whenever there's an update. I can no longer make video responses to comments, now? WTH? It still works on other devices with older versions but not on my phone with the latest update 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️.",1
"I used to really like TikTok, but now I get ad, ad, live, vid, ad, live, vid. I honestly never want to see a live unless I go to live. Theres a lot of really bad live content too, and even if I mark it ""I do not want to see live videos"" or ""I do not want to see videos from this creator"" it doesn't matter, they pop right back up minutes later, days later. I gave Youtube Shorts a try and honestly this is how I wish TikTok was, so I've switched.",1
"I love tiktok but lately it's been acting up. Less views on my content, hashtags have changed with how many people used the hashtag in their post, some have gone away completely and there is something going on with the recent update as of today. It keeps glitching. Please go back to what it was before and that includes the hashtags and stop monopolizing the views on videos.",1
needs to be updated so that if I come off the app with a live open the audio should stop! annoying when you've come off the app and the audio is still playing,1
"Great app, for People who wanna download it I would 💯, so I gave it a 3 because of max limit for typing is to short Please make it longer I would have given it a 4 if it was longer but why 4 and not 5 well its because whenever I first downloaded it it asked what things would you like to watch I pressed arts and crafts but it didn't give me any of that? it's A great App Anyways.",1
"I am incapable of seeing 'Display' so that I can change it to dark mode, I've seen my friends tiktok stuff, and they all have it. Tiktok on my phone has already been updated, and it annoys me that I can't see it.",1
"Tiktok is good.... But it is not working... Like i can't send and receive message..... Whenever i text trough tiktok everytime, they show me, Due to multiple community guideline violations, you are temporarily prevented from sending and receiving messages. 😔...please do some action against this notification 😔",1
"don't get me wrong, I've had tiktok for over 4 years now, and its great! I just absolutely hate that they keep getting rid of helpful things, like comments on reposts, pinning comments, etc. I also hate that you can't search up slideshows. Its really unhelpful. Ive tried to search certain ones up multiple times, and all i get is videos of people screen recording them, and over time it got really annoying. please add/fix this.",1
"Live bar missing, woke up today and when you go to your inbox the lives at the top are not showing, just the stories. I updated last night. I have no idea how to fix it. I've tried everything. Help.",1
"Really great app, one time tiktok crashed and they told me to restore my account, its now gone and I'm logged out, I have tried getting it back,but unfortunately I think that it's now officially gone. Overall: 3 starts",1
"Tik tok works well, but there is a problem. l do not have a chat on tik tok. if someone sends me a message that it is susoended, delete the orogram and download it again, nothing will change. please solve the problem as soon as possible. Thank you.",1
"This app used to be awesome. Now I can't watch 3 or 4 videos without tiktok shop trying to sell me something. I just want to be entertained, not told by some nobody that the product they are getting paid to promote is the best thing they have ever purchased.",1
"The spam on this is ludicrous. ""You're selected"", and ""You are chosen""...ect are persistent and unyielding. No matter how many you block, they just keep coming. I'm really getting tired of it.",1
"The last update, live streams (even if you don't join them) the audio plays over other videos and keeps playing even when you close the app. S24",1

"I use Tiktok a lot, and it's alright. What gets me is when I go to check messages from friends and the UI has these weird transitions that makes me physically sick and gives me a headache. I've shown friends screen recordings of this happening and they claim that it's weird and they don't have that. I'd love for this app to not give me a headache and make me feel sick.",1

NO MICROPHONE FOR VIDEOS,1
"I love tiktok, but it has so many bugs. For instance, when I get out of tiktok the audio of the thing I was still watching is still There!!! Please fiz these immediatly",1
It's good but then it's bad you just got to be careful,1
This app is so amazing . my only problem is that my videos are always on low quality not on high quality.,1

"Very frustrating that I have had TikTok for over a year and still I can't access the TikTok shop to buy items ... Why is this not easily accessible for everyone .. it's a common issue apparently , I've followed all advice that many other people have googled and answered ...",1

Its one the best social media app That you can easily access content even from those that are not in your contact. Its super cool,1
Every time this app updates it keeps crashing when I try to open it!! The only thing that fixes it is uninstalling and downloading it again but you end up loosing all your drafts when you do this. So infuriating can you fix this please. The app deserves 5 stars other than this issue. Edit: Yet again another update and I've to delete the app and loose everything 🤷🏻‍♀️,1

I would say its 3 stars just be cause I would put my age and it never let's me in!!!!!,1
Irritating app.,1
"Since the last time I've reviewed this app I made the point that it fails in enforcing community guidelines fairly. Since then I've had no complaints, but instead new complaints have come up in the past few months. Lately with their TikTok Shop ads and repetitive view/gift-bait content. I cannot tell you how many accounts I've had to block trying to filter out the spamming TikTok Shop ads, gift-bait content, and sexually explicit content. Keeping a 3-star for it's available information",1
My app just updated a few days ago and now the previous video's sound continues to play over the next video which is frustrating.,1
Stop sending this ads short vides yooh,1
Well,1

"I love the app, but I can't like, follow, or even save videos... I can't even do anything on any of accounts It keeps saying I'm unable to like or save videos... This happens when I get a new phone...",1
Good,1
We can't see anyone when they battle the screen is black you can hear and see the gifts It's works for a few people,1
Frozen Screen when turn on Camera and I did new update did not have this problem before I did update please do a BUG FIX,1
Its alright ig.,1
Tiktok is glitching way to much lately. I can't recharge when live or it kicks me. Both screens are blacked out during battles. And it freezes up when I'm live. I am a content creator and thisakes it impossible to do my live streaming. Please fix it!,1
"I don't usually have a problem with tiktok, but now I do. I reported someone for saying the n word towards somebody that I know, just for them to say, ""No violation. Another time somebody was bullying a friend that I know in the comments saying some hurtful things and reported it but yet again ""No violation"" I mean Tiktok you must have a report button for a reason because to me. You are doing absolutely nothing. 3.5 stars and will rate lower if continues .",1
"It's a great app, but the people on it aren't so great. Whenever I tried to make another account it needed my birthday,so I put it in but it got rid of my other accounts and gave me a private one. I tried to make it public but I couldn't. And I keep getting strikes for stuff I said that aren't even bad and I bought a new phone but I don't have the favorite button",1
Jjt Kekt,1
"It's perfectly fine to watch content on, but for me, if I want to make any myself that involves any form of interactive filter, I can't. Since a more recent update all filters appear twice as big as normal making interacting with them next to impossible yet if I record a bit and watch that back the filter is shown to be as it's supposed to be so I'm not sure what that's all about but it needs fixing. Also, stop taking down the audios. You've even taken down one of me talking ffs.",1
Very sharp,1
Nyccc better app,1
"I'm pissy that it's hard to understand... I don't like that it self inserted music and then I don't know how to keep the original sound. That, and it's extremely overwhelming with the amount of things it does, like.... It... Uh- let's just say that it's not for people who can't keep up with the fast world. I'm sorry. I'm going back to Facebook and YouTube where old people live (btw I'm 22, it's just... I'm slow and I prefer slow)",1
It lags and Wont let me do the picture scroll and it annoys me and won't reload my fyp so I don't like it that much but it's still good I do like it recommended not to make lots of drafts though 😾🤗💊,1

"A really good social media app, however on android devices it doesn't have dark mode and does hurt my eyes when watching at night. I know Apple devices have dark mode so why can't android do the same as this is the only app that hasn't developed it. Would be much better if it had dark mode! And would rate it a 5 stars",1

Not to mention the frequent fraudbots, scam shop posts, and (these are STILL a problem yall havent cracked down on)literal $3×bots on this app that SOMEHOW MAKE IT TO MY FEED, I DONT WANT THAT ON MY SCREEN!",1
@ayoub.brohi please unfreeze my account,1
Wow,1
No experience,1
"I love this app. You can watch short videos and watch stuff or tell stories about their life. It's so interesting, and there is basically no ads, just endless scrolling. The messages are pretty good, but sometimes I don't get the notification, or it says someone messaged me, but they didn't, so its just there for a while till it fixes itself. Good app overall",2
"Tiktok is very entertaining and there is so many different categories of videos to watch! Just search a topic, and many videos will pop up within that topic. I do have one problem with this app though. I have an Android device and usually when I'm scrolling, I see videos with a slideshow effect, but when I try to do the slideshow effect, I don't have it. This makes me a bit aggervated because even though I have an Android, I would love if all effects and changes appeared for every device.",2
"I enjoy tiktok a lot , and it is very addicting but i would like to help you guys out. I wish yall would make a feature to go back to your first ever liked video. The reason why is most of us used tiktok during the beginning of quarantine and scrolled for a long time and liked every video, so it is impossible to see your first ever liked video without your app crashing. We would be very happy if you decide to make this a feature and implement it on tiktok.",2
"It's a really, really good app, the idea is really good, but sometimes it just does not work, I am trying to do like the photo thing and sometimes it works, and sometimes it dont, just like, you know, pisses you off so please fix that like, have it as an option again, like it used to and bring it back, because I really want to do a slideshow and it will not work. Some of the sounds are getting deleted like the really good ones.",2
"Love this app ao much, but it has so many problems. My friends will get an update, but when I go to see if I have the option, it's not there! Whenever I ask people what to do, they say, ""Just restart your app😒"" BUT IT NEVER WORKS! plus, they are slowly deleting more and more features to add new useless ones. There are many ads, too! When on my fyp, I just get really random stuff,and it's either a video my friend made, an add, or a video with over 10,000 likes. Never give's me any videos I want.",2
"It's a good app, but there is a problem to where if I do something like accidentally unlike a video in my likes and then I go to like it again, it just dissappears when I exit or refresh the app. It's really annoying at this point because I've been dealing with it for a few months now, and it never did seem to have this problem before. I tried uninstalling the app and downloading it again, and I've tried clearing my cache to even using a different device, but it all didn't solve the issue.",2
"Was working fine for a while but now everytime I search, click a sound, or click on a video that isn't on my FYP or following the app crashes and reloads. Tried cleared out my cache and restarting to no avail. Update: looks like it's been fixed for a while now. Thank you for responding and taking action. editing my review to four stars",2
"great app honestly, it's really fun to watch and make videos. I do have an issue though - in videos where there's CLEARLY an effect being used it doesn't display the little button that has the effect name on it if yk what I mean, then when I try to search for the effect it isn't there. if this is because of the device I have then it's stupid as hell because I have a brand new samsung phone. please fix this issue and also make dark mode available to samsung users 🙏",2
"App is amazing however it says I can't use certain filters because of the region I live in, yet my friends have it and live in the same state as me and they don't have a problem at all, and the filters used to work for me but now they dont and I never changed regions. As soon as this gets fixed I would love to change this to a 5 star review.",2
"Great app, I love all the relatable, funny, and useful content on here, but sometimes there are problems that occur that are really not supposed too. I don't know if anyone else has been having the same problem as me, but my recently every time I like a video from my fyp, it doesn't appear on my profile in the liked videos section. I tried refreshing multiple times, I don't have to update the app because it doesn't need to, and I have cleared out any other tabs that may be open on my phone.",2
I hate the fact that you updated the way videos are put into a playlist and the most recent are at the bottom now. Could you change it back to where the most recent are at the top ? Also I don't know if it's just the server but I'm trying to use the search function and it is so glitchy and laggy to the point it flat out just freezes before the video appears playing music where I'm having to exit the whole app because it gets so Frozen and stuck.,2
"It's an okay app, but I continually have issues with the favorites page. It stops scrolling down after a while, and things often don't favorite to the right folder when I put them there. I've reset my phone and reinstalled the app, and yet it still keeps happening. It's really annoying to have to favorite the video 60 times for it to work because of the feature that notifys the creator when you favorite it. Either than this constant problem, It's a well working app and it's nicely developed.",2
"Great app just wanted to give you my experience. It works the best on iPhone I'm on a Samsung btw. Some filters missing, on accident I deleted tik tok and when I reinstalled it. All my drafts were gone! Wich is okay so also don't delete tik tok if you post or just want to save drafts. Some times tik tok acts up but not very often. This is my review hope it helped!☺️ Update: I'm a little slow it says in drafts unless you download the drafts it wouldn't keep them.🙃💀",2
"Inbox stopped working. I can no longer see dm's. I get notifications that I received them but can't see them in inbox. I can see them on the computer but not on my phone. Updated the app, uninstalled and reinstalled. It worked briefly then stopped working again. Reached out to support but they couldn't offer a solution. Seems like the app got glitchy after the last android update.",2
"Amazing!!! My only social media app to be honest, literally my only complaint was if i log into the app and my fyp just happens to be playing a song, I'll have to pause it before clicking off to look at my profile or to start recording because if not, im hearing the audio play as im trying to look for the sound i was wanting to use or when im trying to record just my voice. messing with the app as a whole, its just getting annoying",2
"The app is fun with hilarious videos and content. The ads are a bit too much for my taste. However, since November 10th 2023 the app is not opening anymore. It's weird, a message appears after it crashes that claims the ""App Has A Bug"". I know some of us are thinking if the government has something to do with this sudden crash problems and supposed ""Bug"" after trying and failing to ban the app in the USA....but who knows what to think 🤔",2
"I rarely have any complaints about this app but my number 1 problem is this: there should be a way to sort favorited audios into playlists like videos. As someone who makes videos, I have collected thousands of sounds to use but most are almost completely unaccessible due to the amount of scrolling that would need to be done. If a feature to sort them was added, I would definitely give 5 stars.",2
"Can't seem to figure a few things out yet. New to this app. I guess some things will come along. I'd like to know how to remove photos out of a folder so that new ones may be put in. I'm been in the help section, perhaps I'm not understanding something. I think to tic toc is pretty cool. I just wish some things were easy to access and to select and layman terms /options like other types of apps.",2
This app is really cool and put together well but the only thing I have to say about it that makes me rated at 4 stars is that when you go to upload a photo just very little editing options and if you're wanting to upload multiple pictures you don't have the choice of what order they're going to... So please update your uploading options and editing software if this was done I'd rate at 10 stars!!!,2
"I loved this app, and I've used it ever since 2019. I gotta say, this has to be better than YouTube. You can say whatever you want without getting in trouble for no apparent reason, and there is no ads you gotta skip, just scroll on by and continue watching these tiktoks. It's absolutely amazing. But, I don't like it when it sometimes glitches out or lags. Overall though, it's a great app. A lot of funny videos on here too.",2
"It is a wonderful app to use! But I have a problem and some people also have the similar problem as me. I cannot find the favorite button anymore when I try to favorite tiktok video, I am hoping Tiktok you will fix this problem because it is infuriating and annoying for most of all people who have the same problem as me. Overall it is a good app, JUST PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM",2
"Can be fun once you start uploading. I really like this app now that I've started uploading and editing inside of it. The editor is slightly more clunky compared to Facebook Reels or Instagram Reels(my very first experience with short-form content), but not as limiting as YouTube Shorts and it's 60 second time limit. You can either upload a bunch of photos in a batch as a slideshow or upload them one at a time to edit text and titles.",2
My favorite app it really is my only problem is if I accidentally swipe then try to go back to the video I was watching I can't fast forward through the content I have already seen in that video. So I have to wait another 3 mins to actually get to the punchline that I didn't even hear in the first place. But u know I can hear it all over again it's fine 🙂 (sarcasm) PLEASE PUT A FAST FORWARD OPTION.,2
"It's an okay app, but I continually have issues with the favorites page. It stops scrolling down after a while, and things often don't favorite to the right folder when I put them there. I've reset my phone and reinstalled the app, and yet it still keeps happening. It's really annoying to have to favorite the video 60 times for it to work because of the feature that notifys the creator when you favorite it. Either than this constant problem, It's a well working app and it's nicely developed",2
"My favorite app that I have, it's entertaining, very few ads and you don't even have to watch them. The only problem I have is, after USG got all their songs removed from the app, tons of filters also got removed. the issue with this is, I see plenty of other people using these filters that got removed for me (and no, I'm not seeing old videos, these videos are very recent, most of them being posted this month) and I've tried to update tiktok but I can't get the filters back.",2
"This app is just perfect! If you're having a bad, you'll even forget what happened in less than 10 minutes. Yes, sometimes theres inappropriate content, but there's an option where you can block and report in appropriate content! But overall, you won't even need a TV if you have tiktok. It's television it's self!😂 Install it now if you haven't, cuz what are you waiting forrrra. You're missing out!",2
"For a couple months now everytime I try to listen to my more older saved audios, it takes forever to load and sometimes glitches. I find this to be very annoying and frustrating when way before it worked perfectly fine. Additionally, nothing is loading, and if it does it takes way too long. My internet is fine, as other apps are working well. Please fix this issue.",2
"Good app and all EXCEPT how some different device types have more features. The one thing that I want is to be able to post a photo in a comment. I have a Google pixel and I'm not sure which type of phone (I'm pretty sure it's apple) that can post pictures in the comments but I would like that on every phone type. Overall, its a pretty good app. Would recommend if your fine with a few less features then others",2
I noticed a recent flaw in my TikTok app. I'm an Android user and when I open it there's no sound. It's the only app that does it. I had to turn the volume up or down to get the sound to initiate. Crazy flaw. I have three different accounts I don't want to uninstall it and reinstall it. I have a funny feeling I'm going to have to!,2
"Very addicting, easy to use, rich in preference settings. The only thing I have a problem with is the organization of comment replies, everything is jumbled up and people miss corrections (due to the inability to edit comments) because it's mixed in with all the other replies. I would suggest a cleaner way to organize replies and comments, possibly a thread like structure for replies under replies. In order to avoid the comment section looking like a program script, I would also add collapsing.",2
The sound keeps going up every time I enter the app even tho it was turned off beforehand and it has not been very pleasant as there were times when it was supposed to be quiet and the volume just went up. Other than that the app is ok. P.s. there are some filters that do not work on my phone model which is a bit annoying.,2
"I love Tiktok, but since the new update you can't make slideshows anymore? Every time I select my photos it somehow turns them into a video...and that's so annoying...Also...if you swipe across the screen you suddenly see some filters... WHY?! Otherwise good app :)",2
This app is amazing!! I appreciate how Tiktok helps you find your community! I love how you can use filters and other cool stuff. The search bar has EVERYTHING just search something up and it will pop up. The only bad thing is that it takes up space and it is sometimes really laggy. Other than that Tiktok is a very useful and fun platform for endless scrolling!,2
"Good app. Only complaint is that when you try to search something, it deletes what you were typing when you click space because Tiktok doesn't recognize the word. For example, If I were to search for an artist with a unique name, it would delete the whole word after I click space.",2
Dear TikTok team! I have an idea for you to improve TikTok. As we know that TikTok saves one video at a time. Sometimes we want to save more videos at a time but we still wait for that video. Improve the saving policy. We could save at least three videos at a time or we pin three videos for downloading at a time.,2
"It needs a ""last watched"" tab where it shows your previous videos. It' be prefect then. And youtube can't claim tabs that bring you back to previous videos because it is a form of recreation. Especially if you name/use it in a different way.",2
make slideshows available for all phones! when you watch videos in history it should not add them to your history. when using a template please stop making it play in the background so I have to go back and pause the music. do something about the sex bots. if you read this thank you very much.,2
"Dear Tiktok, I have 3 requests. 1, please remove that tiktok logo outro sound at each & every video. It's annoying! 2, make an option to edit the comment after we post it. I had to delete the whole comment when I need to correct a mistake! 3, please bring back showing what I have commented when someone liked it. When someone liked my comment I don't remember which, so I always have to open the videos. That option was so very time saving & useful. Hope you guys will consider. Thank You! ❤",2
"I love this app so much and it's a great app, but I wish TikTok would bring in something new for people to collect their virtual coins for free without purchasing. I wish you could do that for us. Please make that happen. Also let's not forget that my following list seems to have a lag whenever I follow people. TikTok needs to fix this.",2
This app is nice but sometimes it has alot of badwords and most kids love to watch it so I recommend you not to make your child watch it but otherwise it's very fun and it also helps you in a lot of ways the app is always freezing I thought it was my phone so I bought a new phone and it didn't stop freezing so they need to fix it 😊😀 50/100,2
"Great app usually, been laggy as of late but great app to learn new things, the search function within the comments is great and lots of topics to explore and learn from. The shop is great although buyer beware with ur money as with any store. Their earning programs are good and getting noticed within ur niche seems more doable and relatable than insta. Filters are also great and overall enjoyable and great for endless scrolling. Happy scrolling!!",2
I'm having issues with my messaging. Everytime I open my dms on the computer it only shows part of the list. When I open one on my phone it doesn't show the message I have to open and close so many times sometimes.,2
It's a great way to learn a couple of easy and fast life hacks or share funny videos with friends. But it is horribly time consuming.. like I personally spend over 4-6h a day on tiktok just mindlessly scrolling trying to find something interesting.,2
"I love the app so much,from watching cooking,to dancing. It is very helpful that i can pause it during slideshows as i dont want to hear the sound. But there is some inappropriate language used and its very dirty.",2
"In the last week, the messaging component has been troublesome. After writing a message, you'll realize there is no SEND button....just an icon for emojis. Generally this is a fun app, but the communication between users is broken. (S24 Ultra on Verizon)",2
"Bugg? So my best friend and I constantly send TikToks to each other. So it's really nice that you hit send and the three most recent people you've sent TikToks to are right there so a quick share. But my best friend isn't there for a quick share. I have to scroll to ""More"" and send videos to them from there. It's not a bad bug it's just mildly inconvenient. And we're both friends with each other and everything.",2
"I love TikTok. Except the fact that it crashes often, while I'm LIVE and I switch to another app to do something real quick. I should be able to switch apps while I'm LIVE and come back to TikTok without having to reload the entire app again, just to join resume my LIVE. Also, I'm hardly getting viewers whenever I'm LIVE. There's a promote option, but I don't like the fact that I have to pay to get more viewers. I used to get hundreds of viewers when I first started going LIVE.",2
I've used this app for 3 yrs and I've been having issues about it. Sometimes the sound of the video just magically goes silent and nothing helps especially when I'm trying to film a video and I try to look for a sound but the sounds are unable to unmute I've tried everthing to ipdating and reinstalling the app but nothing works. Please fix your bugs great app overall 🫶🫶,2
"I really love tiktok, but can you guys make it so that the subtitles doesn't go away when you hit clear display. Sometimes I like to look at the full screen but I still want to read what they are saying.",2
"I love tiktok but ny only issue is, as a person with an asymmetrical face everytime i want to do a tiktok with the back camera i have to put on the inverted face but sometimes we have a funny filter on so I cant use 2 so I was wondering if you can add the inverted filter as a basic choice like the flash and beauty bottons!!",2
"it's a good app, it keeps me entertained and i get good laughs out of it, just wish there was dark mode on android. also there's a lot of pop-ups which can make it overwhelming oftentimes.",2
"Would be 5 stars if they would stop trying to connect my account with friends/contacts. Literally would never want my friends/contacts to see my tiktoks or what i like, so why keep trying to show me profiles of them. I hope you guys stop sharing my profile with them because some of those contacts are work related, not friends. Also, I've noticed that whenever a Live stream comes across the audio will continue to play when I keep scrolling to new vids. So I get 2 audios playing at the same time.",2
"It's a good app and fun as well, I would give it 5 stars if I didn't have any problems following others because every time time I would follow someone and either refresh the screen or leave and re-enter their page my following would disappear, and I don't if anyone is having this problem or if it's just me but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated about it",2
"I don't get the updates I see other people get, I don't know if it's a type of phone I have or if I'm doing something wrong but I don't know how to fix it. Also I can't use many different filters, like I'll see filters on my fyp but I'm not able to use them. Another thing, it's really annoying how a lot of sounds and popular audios are being muted and removed. But other than those things, great app, kind of addicting ngl, and I've met some cool people. Overall, w 🤫🧏",2
"Its good, but the problem is, whenever you try to reset your for you page, there's ALWAYS some things you don't want, EVEN if you press uninterested. It's annoying, honestly.",2
"The app in overall is amazing, although, I have some suggestions. - Add dark mode for android devices. - Option to filter more than 100 keywords on content preferences. - Option to organize better saved and liked videos.",2
"The app is pretty good where you can watch videos your fyp suggests, people that entertain you, and can even make friends on the app. My issue with it however is how I don't have my friends tab anymore, it use to be there when I first had the app but now it's gone. Now I have to go to my profile to see what my friends upload. And everytime I view what they upload it still says there's a new post even though I already watched what they post. App is good overall but I hope that can be fixed.",2
"Tiktok is great, but when I said a strange street name in Florida they literally banned it? I'm so confused. Tiktok, I was just saying that gay was one of the strange street names and I didn't mean for it to be offensive to anyone. So I hope you fix this when people are talking about a street, NOT a person that is what ever it is. If you ever fix this issue, that will be great. But overall, the app is great! It gives me notifications about the analytics of my videoes! A 9 out of 10.",2
I like tiktok ok but it's detailed and confusing. It's got lots to offer. My in app purchases don't go through. So I have no ideas how to purchase things or maybe I shouldn't buy anything and save my money. 😃 I only give it 4 stars because I haven't seen a tutorial for it so I'm just learning. It's easy to post but the rest is confusing.,2
"I enjoy this app sm, I would enjoy it way more if it had a search bar for Favourite Collections because this would be easier to navigate way better to find a specific folder and video and this would be less time consuming and I'm sure a lot of people would agree with me.",2
"I was on tik tok since around 5 years now. really good app, many content creators, chats where I can finally delete message for both.. but since few days ago on my fyp appear more vids that I don't like. I picked that vids as ""not interesting"", but there's more of them now. if yesterday I had at least few manhwa vids that I liked, today it's even worse, bc there's almost none of them",2
"Honestly, there's a lot, and I mean A LOT of bad content on this app, lots of cringy creators, ""thirst trappers"", extreme political account, and more, and that honestly can ruin the experience. However, once you finally get around all that and the *holy algorithm* finalizes, you can find some genuinely funny, original, and emotional accounts who fit just your style of entertainment and enjoyment. Just be careful, the bad content is hiding behind every swipe.",2
"Overall one of the best apps I've ever used, but I do not get slideshows on my FYP or following and I've tried everything but it does not work. Aswell I cannot use the repost button and it only works if I uninstall and them reinstall the app, and only works the first time I open it. I've had this app since 2019 and it has always been like this. Fix it please.",2
"I overall love this app! I always look forward to watching funny videos, learning new dances to songs, and making TikToks absolutely love this app it has its pros and cons but I think it's a pretty good app if you wanna go thru and binge watch random videos I highly recommend but watch out for creeps scams etc, love this app tho!",2
"My own personal experience with TikTok is alright, I mean yes there are a few small bugs that happen once in a while, I'm not exactly bothered. I like to scroll on TikTok in my free time. However, the one thing I can't tolerate is when you are watching a video and then some random ads pops up and it's not even about business for me it's something really irritating and irrelevant and not exactly innapropiate for anyone. So please TikTok if you see this please fix you ad algorithms.😅",2
"First of all, you can't search for slide shows, which is Hella annoying. Second, Give back adding comments to our reposts, Third, stop taking down random videos for no reason, and take down the videos of women literally breastfeeding. Also, fix the search option. When I search something and scroll not even 5 videos I get something I don't want. Besides all these issues and more, the app is amazing and is a great source of comfort. If this app is banned in the US I'm moving somewhere else ong.",2
I gave 4 stars because every thing is okay but i only facing two problems first the way of patment for any thing on the platform Nd the other issue i started to get bord from the high restorations that prevent creating creative ideas and different ways,2
"I love Tik Tok and I have it on my phone and on my tablet. I am currently having a problem with it starting, on my tablet, the other night I went to use it and it wouldn't work, and it's still not working. It will try to connect and shows me the sign in page and I try to log in but it won't let me and starts flickering and just shuts down. Won't work. I've tried uninstalling the app and installing it. Still not working. Please someone help!!! Very frustrated.",2
"The app itself is good you can post and watch videos get advice,learn new tricks but every time I go to put in a text, when I'm putting the text down it's fine but, when I post the video the text is either small, stretched our or bigger and it's really annoying hopefully it gets fixed soon!",2
"The app is amazing in ways like all things but allowing all these fake pages and allowing people to fake issues with creators page and now the app won't let me block bots, it's not showing my messages, its spinning when tryong to send in issues and wont load. I have emailed and sent in issues with my app and nothing as of yet.",2
"Very fun app, but i've been dealing with multiple glitches and it's can be very annoying. By example, since i created my account (around 1 year ago) i haven't been able even once to repost any tiktoks which is kinda annoying. And sometimes i just can't watch tiktok at all and message anyone.",2
"One of the best apps for the news,content,making money and of course time killing.App is great but the things that IOS has in Android we don't have it.one of them is dark theme.And I face this problem,my reposted videos sometimes disappears so I need to repost it again,and due to this I think we have some limit to repost the videos.",2
"I don't know what's happening to TikTok?? So first, Tiktok took away my photo and video button and I couldn't upload photos. I deleted it and installed it again and I had it but I didn't have my repost button and all of my reposts were gone. Then my drafts got deleted?? I went to storage and cleared up space and downloads and I got my repost buttom back but my photo and video option disappeared. Plus I had troubles uploading videos because tiktok would lag. And no it's not my phone its new!",2
"Tiktok is cool. But I just don't believe only 20 of my 4000+ followers make videos each day. And requesting samples aren't easy, why when I tap the buttons to request samples or closes instead of open when I never tapped anything to close it. It should be much easier to put in a request",2
"The app is amazing. It would be helpful if there was a way to see the videos you liked from the first one. I've liked over 1000 videos so it's near impossible to see go through them all, if there was a way to filter by date or something like that.",2
"I've been unable to post my videos I worked so hard on. Felt I should update the app but turned out the same way afterwards, then I had to uninstall the app and install again but couldn't find my drafts that had close to 100 vids that was yet to be posted. It's painful. Please I need your help on how to restore them.",2
Tiktok it's a great app to use but since it's so laggy and sometimes I lose my edits and can't publish them. Now tiktok mutes my sounds for my edits and I get it it's ok to mute my sounds for my videos but since umg is here it's getting really annoying but I am dealing with it. Also tiktok the are inappropriate stuff like there are some girls with nothing on and it just shows which really botherd me bc I was watching and some girls was with nothing on also ppl are posting about p*rn and u know..,2
"It's a great app, been a daily user since 2020. However I'm incredibly frustrated that the new update has taken away the ""following"" tab. I no longer follow people or they dissapear from my FYP. There is the friends tab but unless they follow you back (which a lot of big creators don't) they don't come on your FYP very often. PLEASE BRING IT BACK",2
"Good app! I just can't do the slideshow mode, I tried everything, updating, uninstalling it and reinstalling it, clearing cache, reporting it, but nothing is working, please fix this soon!",2
Good app. and addictive. But the only issue is that the slideshow keeps being on video mode. even though I want it to be manually swiping to see the photos. I think it's called photo mode.,2
This app is very best but when we need to save without watermark it doesn't work so i need to fix this bug plss. I have this problem only and all of things is cool filters and affects and capcut all of things is very best 5 star for them but this bug is not fine so please fix it..,2
Very good and accessible app I love the features and it's pretty easy to edit with ..the only problem am having is that after updating the app I can't follow other tiktokers of I follow them it doesn't reflect on my following list and it won't reflect on their page that I have followed them I hope tiktok fix this soon enough Thanks,2
"This app is very good, but I have some issues. Whenever I update the app, I will get a feature I've never had 6 when I update it again, it's gone. My ability to repost videos will change every time I update, and I can't view friends' reposts.",2
May we please have a feature that allows us to block content by sound. PLEASE! And I mean block sound not report sound. I may not like the sound but there are those who like it. I just want it to stop appearing on my wall only. Not to remove the sound entirely.,2
"The app is great but I don't understand why it any time I tap a like it removes and tells me that I'm tapping fast meanwhile I'm not, I uninstalled the app and installed it again but it's still saying the same thing whenever I tap. Pls fix these, I would have given it a five star if not this problem",2
"As a YouTuber I love to use TikTok for making videos and such. Having many followers feels amazing BUT.. I wish that inappropriate TikToks wouldn't be everywhere on my FYP. I've seen a bunch of LIVES about Win=I go to sleep with depressing music in the background and the streamer is placing Amethyst blocks and there is this ""THANKS FOR THE FOLLOW"" every two secs and this ""Kuru Kuru Uwu"" sounds going off every second. I just want them to stop being so repetitive, overall, INCREDIBLE APP!",2
"It was great but I absolutely hate how a music app is letting UMG remove all the good sounds. And when I try to post slide show videos I'm not able to slide,the video is sliding on its own. Tiktok please fix this",2
"Really buggy with recent updates. Audio continues to play after window closed, app randomly self-launches, repeats same sequence of videos OFTEN. Still world's better than youtwatface",2
"It's great, be careful or you'll lose precious time in your day it's so addictive. 😂 Only real problem is see, is that you create a profile. It can be seen by other people. You can interact with others etc.. but there is no way to report other profiles that you don't want interacting with you. (Ex: fake profile claiming you won something). Another thing I haven't confirmed , is the possibility to make a profile for minor / children. parents should be able to create a limited profile for kidd",2
"I love this app with a passion!! but tiktok, please update my account. I STILL don't have the slidshow feature, so could you please figure out how to get me that feature? iv been really wanting to use it, please, and thank you!",2
"Well, it's tiktok, everyone knows about tiktok, but the quality has gone down, I see hardly any funny videos or even entertaining videos, just boring stuff and the same song over and over and over, it gets boring, the only reason i still have the app is because of my videos and my friends, I got banned once for absolutely no reason, it said I had to be 13+ but when I verified my birthday it said I wasn't old enough, it's still a good app though, there are a few good videos every now and then",2
"It just stops working for no reason. Keeps saying I have no internet connection, but I'm connected to internet just fine. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling and now I can't even log back into my account and it still says no internet connection.",2
"Hello Tiktok developers, I love using this application, but why is there no option for dark mode yet for Xiaomi phones? I searched in all the settings and did not find it. I did the latest updates and did not find it. Why haven’t you added it yet? My eyes hurt, please add it,I waited too much",2
My experience on TT so far has been a good bag of mixed emotions really. Beware though the thought police are en masse there policing every single thing that's said. TT really is for free speech but they correct it if they get it wrong. So for that I'll give 4 stars for informative posts and messages and entertainment.,2
"This app keeps crashing when I try and open the app. I click on the app and it won't open. My phone is working fine. However I have to uninstall the app, go back to play store and re install tiktok again. There must be a glitch in this app.",2
"I like the app but theres some problems -many unnesesary updates- they often ruin the experience when nobody asked for them -the deleting account procces. I think you should be given the option wether you actually want to wait the 30. Also the fact that if you havent waited the 30 days and want to use the same gmail account it automatically renews it -The ""not interested"" button not working especially with live videos -adds, even if youre looking at someones account -optimalised only for iphone",2
"It is really great to show your creativity to everyone, but since it is missing one star cause every time I kept trying to open the app, it kept crashing or bugging out and kicking me out",2
"It's alright, however posting videos may be difficult with limited sounds. I recommend to pass time and entertainment. Some pick this up as a job!",2
"It's a great app to explore but I just needed to tell everyone reading this that IT IS NOT FOR KIDS,there are multiple slideshows that have inappropriate images (🌽 with a p), I also noticed that your have different features on different accounts, for example,on one account I can't make slideshows but on another,I can, I find it very unfair and unreasonable,but so far I haven't had any other issues with this app.",2
"Tiktok if fun and let's you watch many variations of videos but one thing I have is whenever it says ""would you like more videos about this"" It will give you the options to click ""yes"" ""no"" or ""custom choice"" and I always pick custom. It used to work but now when I put it in, it doesn't give me any videos related to what I put in. I usually ask for volleyball stuff because I'm very interested in volleyball but it never shows me anything to do with volleyball. Other than that it is a great app!",2
"It's a really good app, but sometimes, whenever I scroll down and back up to watch a video again if I'd I scroll to live and scroll up fast the live will forever be playing",2
Nice good app,2

"Sir,I have about 18.2k followers. A few days ago almost all my videos went viral. But for the past few days, a video of mine has not been circulating well. There is no name to be viral. If the video is not viral then how do you say I will be inspired to make a new video. I showed you both the screenshot of my previous view and the screenshot of the current view. Please review and fix my problem. I am with you too, stay with you too Username: antor__1",2

"Good app. Only complaint is that when you try to search something, it deletes what you were typing when you click space because Tiktok doesn't recognize the word. For example, If I were to search for an artist with a unique name, it would delete the whole word after I click space.",2

"I love watching the tutorials. Also gives me a chance to support small businesses. F/U 4 yrs later: I have learned so much as far as crafts in TikTok. Also, pop-up videos are so amusing. I don't use it for news or politics cuz it can be the Devil's Playground for misinformation and sowing of evil, which, when reaped, will only cause more divide in this country. The dangerous challenges leading to teens harming themselves was awful. However, it can be improved. I would hate to see it vanish.",2
Pretty darn good app. Love the idea of being able to connect with other people to get information on different subjects with different views!!! Awesome creators out there for sure. Only issue is with the new update is the constant freezing and buffering. Never an issue before now it's a big one. Does it both off and on WiFi so yeah pretty sure an app issue. Please fix this 😁 it's not just me I have asked others and they're having the same issue as well!!! Other than that excellent app.,2
"This is the best app on the Internet. So easy to install you can't possibly make a mistake setting it up, even for the simple minded. You can search for the type of video you would like to see and the algorithm locates videos based on what you have watched, liked and commented on - so like and comment only the type of video you want to see more of. You can download videos you would like to keep. Also you can change any setting under profile. Oh, TikTok collects less data than Google or amazon",2
Tiktok is a great place to be i can Express myself. And have fun . On this app. It allows me to talk to all of my friends. And i love to cosplay as well 😍💜🧡 I hope that tikdoesn't mute all of our videos. I heard what happened and I'm praying for a way that will allow the app to continue to let us use audio and music. This is not right. We should be able post what we like and continue to Express ourselves.,2
"Edit: This review was from a long time ago, and these issues have been fixed! Orig: I love tiktok, but for some reason the option to turn captions on or off is missing for me. It is just not there under Accessibility. I usually love captions, but they often overlap with text on the tiktok that the creator put up so it prevents me from being able to read either.",2
"Love the app it rarely has issues. It can be annoying when it prompts me multiple times about adding my contacts to my follows. The report function is decent, some things that are clearly against community standards are returned as ""no violations found"". Also a little annoying the amount of false info spread by fake experts, but hey that's life. All of that said, great UI, video editing capabilities, love the filters, great place to find entertainment and spread info.",2
"I love this app very much! It's so addicting to scroll and see other people's content, or what's going on in they're lives! Ever since I started scrolling on TikTok, I never went back to YouTube, or any social media! This app only has one problem with the slideshows.. when you even click off the app or turn your phone off, it deletes all of the typing you made and it's been very annoying! I'd be very pleased if you fixed that. Thanks, TikTok!",2
"It's not laggy, it's not Constantly trying to have pop-app ads or have a text messages or anything like that and it's really good because. You can have like unlimited friends . These notifications that someone liked something or like someone. Like a post that you did. It'll just be on the thing that's. On the bottom of your phone or tablet or any other devices.",2
"I love this app, just some times it's glitches, I would like it if when you leave the app while watching a video, you could go back to watch the same video, and I would Like if there was maybe a pop up when you accidentally refresh your fyp that says like ""Are you sure you want to refresh"" so that way you didn't lose your video. But over all, lovely app",2
"Always loved the app and how tiktok has continued to advance. The new update though, when you click on a message or profile, the transition to the next screen is horrendous. At first i thought it was just my device, but it apparently is everyone. I'm not sure if it was an attempt to jazz things up or what, but, that definitely is a no go for me. Please take that out of the next update lol!!!",2
"I rely on TikTok the most when it comes to cheering me up, making me laugh, or just being on it when I'm bored! I'm glad there are so many people to make videos for the sake of others. I'm super thankful that we can just skip the ads even if sometimes the ads are fun to watch X3. I love all the topics and the different kinds of TikTok you can end up on. I first discovered it when it was Musically but it changed to TikTok soon after. But overall it's great! :D -Lee",2

"If you need a distraction from monotony, this app has short videos on health, ufo uso phenomena, conspiracies of all kinds. I drop in and listen to the next generation, that is probably you, expound on the Word of God. Some miss the mark entirely. When the Living Word abides in you, You can't help but to preach The Word.

"The best app in the world! I use it for everyday search, and discovering new music! A now trending creator in the United States! This app can change your entire life for the better! You can make serious money with Shop, or the Creator Rewards program! Have fun and give it a shot! You don't have to look like a runway model, or make perfect videos. I wish everyone success. 💕",2
"Good but pls add a not interested in this sound option istg my ears hurt and soul cries when I have to listen to some of these sounds. Thank you Update: you know when you watch a video and go on the page to watch second one. It gives you the ""\\// Just watched"" it sometimes fails, and then you are stuck because it usually happens when the vid is too old I was wondering If there is a fix for that caz old vid= alot of scrolling and sometimes you can't even find the just watched video.",2
"Title: Great App with Room for lmprovement Description: TikTok is a great app for entertainment and creativity. However, l've encountered instances where my videos suddenly faced limitations in reach without clear explanation, causing frustiation. More transparency on video visility algorithms and cleare communication for content limitations would enhance the user experience. Overall, a fantastic platform witih potential for further improvement. 5,419 people found this helpful",2
"I've never been more peaceful with an app in my life. I truly am connecting with people and have really started to love this app! Video editing is great! Slightly irritating when the song clips get removed, but other than that I love tik Tok ❤️",2
"However, there are some missing features that I feel would enhance the user experience. Firstly, it would be great to have a modern trending page within the 'songs' section, showcasing the top trending songs of the day. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include regional soundtracks by official artists to avoid the upload of copyrighted material. Lastly, users should be able to use 15-second clips of any sound within their TikTok videos, similar to how Instagram Reels allow for longer clip",2
"Earlier today posted some videos on my TikTok account, all of them are showing0viewers. Just 2 videos show only 1 viewer. This happened before and after I've updated TikTok today. Along with restarting my android phone. The updates/ notifications are really messed up. The inbox button usually shows a red dot for updates/notifications. It shows a red dot all the time. When I click the inbox, nothing new. For the lo",2
"Currently, Tiktok is one of the most useful apps, through which all the funny videos from all over the world can be seen very quickly, and this app has many features like uploading and downloading videos, sending likes, comments, sharing and more beautiful options and in this app. From excellent privacy and going viral to gaining exposure and making new friends through communication. So I think Tiktik is great and great medium than other apps, so red rose from me to Maki of Tiktik company.",2
"Well folks, after a couple of years as a user, viewer, contributor and reviewer, I feel that now is the time to be fair dinkum, and rate this platform as I see it. The app is very easy to navigate, 5 stars, the content on the site is, at times, informative and relevant but never boring, 5 stars. To date, I have had nothing eventuate that could make me change my initial rating of 5 stars. So guys, well done and may continued success be your constant companion. Cheers.",2
"This is the best social media app that happened to the world. simple to use and empowers All categories of human Financially with its unique features. TikTok remains the best social media app in this generation. But TikTok team needs to add certain features like voice note on message, and the possibility to edit already sent message after few minutes of sending. l love ❤️ TikTok.",2
"Since the update, the chat in Lives is way too hard to follow. When someone joins, the chat scrolls and you miss so much. Please change it back to just flashing on the bottom. 4/3/24 - Chat no longer scrolls up showing every person that joins on the guest side at least. 4/12/24 - Seems as though this was fixed so I changed it to 5*. Keeping original so they know it's bad for the lives to scroll when people join",2

"TikTok isn't just an app; it's a cultural phenomenon, redefining social media as we know it. With its addictive short-form videos and personalized algorithm, it's become the ultimate destination for entertainment, inspiration, and connection. From viral dance challenges to heartfelt storytelling, TikTok offers something for everyone, making it the undisputed champion of social media platforms. Join the millions who've embraced its unique charm",2
Depends on the algorithm but still 70% of the people is a bad influence. Good as an app but humanity made it a nightmare. There are still worth-your-time videos from specific creators. There's still hope this world can be a better place. That's why it gets 2 stars.,2
"It is considered the best,without competitors,the most reliable, the best,the most quality and the best in the world,if it was not reliable and if it was harmful to me and my family,I would never let them use this live messenger app With all the great features,I would not have encouraged it to be as reliable,secure, high-quality and at the level of the best and first global app live story and one of the first in the world,USA should stop its stupid war commercial with China,Tik Tok is safe.",2
"My opinion as a person who has 'Used' this app for 4+ Years is just that this app is Mind-Blowing! It has knowledge, and information, about your favourite Subjects, it has lots of different Categories to choose from, the ones you like. The thing I like the most is probably 'The Tik-Tok Live', it's a feature where people with over 1,000 followers have Permisson of going live on the platform, to talk with others and to also gain points, when people gift 🎁, and you can win 'Real' money, End.",2
"Hello TikTok, I just wanted to stop in and leave a new update for ya all. I'm still giving the platform 5✨⭐⭐Rating even throw I have some problems I just can't seem to get resolved. I started back in 2002/ up to about 2500 followers. But here's. My problem. I used to be able to pick where else I wanted my videos to go other then TikTok, IE/Facebook, Instagram, and the others that are available. I can't change that setting at all😕 It posts to Instagram story every time.",2
"Love it, but I hate when I make content that gets accidentally deleted. It should be easier to back up drafts that's it though. Love how they changed the time you can record for to 10m!!! love TT editing features!",2
"Finally an app that allows us to see and learn so much information from people just like us anywhere! I think it's incredible the extent of the U. S. government trying to ban it, that would ruin our freedom of speech. I hope platforms like tiktok constantly keep running, as long as they allow everyone a voice and ability to speak!",2
"People if you don't update allot of things on tiktok won't work like filters and stuff like that it happened to me, now I update. I have no more problems.Thank you TikTok for fixing the filter now I can used them all. This is the only app that have no problems when update",2
"Little irritated that I spent 5 weeks thinking the US successfully banned you because two days after hearing they were trying to again, I couldn't log in, only to find out TODAY that I just needed to clear my cache because an update you made made my phone nauseous trying to sync the data together. Good to see you're okay. Now stop asking me to rate the app every two weeks, here's your damn 5 Stars.",2
"I love this app, also I have a suggestion for a new feature, if someone wants to do a live, but limit the people who are allowed in it, they could put the live on friends only! I think it would be a cool feature to make!",2
This app is very fun and funny but for some reason when l view certain videos it kicks me out. I don't know if it's a bug in the app or it's just my device. Edit I did go to report a problem I did all the steps it told me to do and it still kicks me out.,2
"I can't even live without this app anymore lol. The algorithm is jst chef's kiss, my fyp doesn't show me anything i don't want to watch and sometimes shows me news things when i jst be thinking it's getting a lil boring, it's like it can read my mind which us scary but whatever. But it's kinda getting slow nowadays and my phone keeps getting frozen often. Hope they solve this issue fast. Otherwise best video app.",2
"Honestly, i was one of the guys saying ""its an app for dancing kids whh would i download it?"" Its not. I follow more like minded people tha i thought existed. It helped me realize my views are not radical to the world but the area i live in. Its helped me connect to a world i honestly never felt i belonged too. Its not perfect and i'm only a consumer of it and have never truly tried the comtent creation part of it other than just screaming into the void but its amazing for what it is",2
I love using the app Tiktok mostly every day of the week. It is a good digital app because I can edit videos or photos of mine to make it more creatively for the audience to get more views up to 1M. I can even pick your music effects ir style to go with my content of the video. I really want to achieve more likes than other followers by posting more photos within the week.,2
"This app is very addictive with an incredible algorithm, the only downside is that tiktok is very strict. Please make the moderation less strict. - EDITS: As we can see in tiktok video trends alot people love listening to TIKTOK AUDIO, it would be a great idea for tiktok to make it a MUSIC APP! This app would be used as social media and listening to music at the same time. I'm pretty sure EVERYONE would love this update and by super hyped about this!",2

I have had this amazing app since 2019 and im in love this is very addicting so if you dont like being on your phone a lot this app isnt for you but personally i definitely recommend it. It is a great way to share about yourself and what you know. And to communicate and make friends!!,2

Love the app just one or two things. My account was fine until about a week ago when all of my saved filter were gone. I did some research and it looks like I have to change my location but in my settings there's nothing to do that. Just a bug I need fixed.,2

"It's nice. It's entertaining. It's crazy. They's drama, there's everything that you need if you want to be entertained. Go to TikTok straight away. TikTok was the first app that I downloaded on my new phone, which is the first one To be.. When I'm stressed, this is the place. is my place to be when I'm stressed. I was TikTok.",2
The interface is easy and user friendly. Really love the platform and i would recommend my friends and family to use the platform as well. There isn't much i don't like. The platform is easy for me and works smoothly.,2
"Til Tok is a great app. I stay entertained with this app for hours. It captures my attention and doesn't lose it for a long time. I stay glued to my phone watching Til Tok's around the clock night and day, laughing or intensely listening to the stories on there. I love Tik Tok!!",2
"In the beginning, I wasn't sure whether it's a good or bad app, but as I gotta know about it from a few of my friends, I downloaded it and found it very useful and interesting app. 😊 I'm definitely happy with it and give it full marks and also urge to all my friends and family members to use it as well 😊.",2
"I don't know how to do anything. I know how to watch videos. I like to do that. These videos are diverse and put together by unique people and continues through several different hands. I still really like the platform, even though I still have yet to really make any movies. However, they are very stingy with what you're allowed to say even when it comes to simple criticisms. And in my mind calling someone a doofus is extremely mild. Perhaps it is tick Tock that is a doofus. A spade is a spade",2
"I used to love this app! It used to be so much better, but now it is full of ads! My favorite contributors have left for other apps bc TikTok is censoring all their content!! Now I look at other apps much more. You are losing it.",2
"It's an amazing app, can't be watched offline but if you save the videos you can watch them on your gallery. Got a wide range of videos and content for a wide range of personalities but it doesn't make it look nice by putting any inappropriate content on FYP which is quite disturbing. If your kids was watching tiktok like 5 year old idiots do, when they shouldn't be, thats when it's bad but there my only concerns and agreements.",2
Great app 👌 a different place to know what is happening in real time. Lives are on point for the most part. It's a great place to find trending products. A nice way to learn a number of new things or try different recipes.,2
This app literally safe to my line from suicide in. I am so motivated and intrigued to see others in their most long moments of solitude or gratitude of a Accomplishment of Such expression and showings. Hey look what I did So please understand have grace and participate in you completely understand what I mean. Thank you love beautifully rare,2
"In my opinion tiktok is the best, i downloaded this app in 2018 and i still use after 5 years i still do its amazing but the ads now really bad to be honest but still you can skip it by scrolling down, and you can find alot of stuff to help you on your life, and im sure you will be addicted to tiktok like me hah! Thank you for reading i hope this review helps you",2
"The number of users(1B+) tells how people all around the world are happy to have it and enjoying this great App.but this days,after i made my last update,the audio on the next video comes while i'm watching another one.i hope this update will fix the problem!the other thing is, while searching 'Creator Search Insights', some people find 'View' on the result page,some do not.why is this happening to some of us?are there any discriminations b/n us,your users?Sorry for the longer review &Thank you!",2
First time on tiktok. 4-2024. Someone used my name on social media. Google. Yahoo. Outlook. Is aware of this. Thank you. The app is great. Little slow. I am a photographer. Actor. Abstract artist. I need to show my talent. Thank you. Tiktok.,2
"Essay on My Favorite App TikTok Posted on December 9, 2020 by Royal52 TikTok is the most popular app that has grabbed the attention of millions of people. It was developed by Bamboo Curtain country. The primary audience of TikTok is the teenagers who have gone crazy for this app. It has achieved a high rating in the Google Play Store because of the countless teenagers who are using it throughout the world. It has a lot of advantages, but the issues it has caused so far cannot be ignore",2
I like creating and sharing educational videos on here. I don't really watch many videos though. The video editing capability is great! Sometimes it glitches pretty badly though and I've lost hours of editing because of that. I know it would be smarter to make the video on my PC and then post it to the app but I prefer to edit on the go since I cannot sit in a chair for very long. I can edit my videos on the treadmill which is awesome!! Resolution could be better though that's,2
I can't believe this app is free. Looks like my country may ban it. It's a shame because this app has been so helpful and has made me a happier and better person to see and connect with likeminded individuals. TikTok is unparalleled and is by far the best social media app in existence.,2
I love tiktok because like I been getting famous and love how they show the beauty of talents and dances and all of those talented things but the problem is that it is lagging and that it is not showing Me the right filter like I been trying to use stop motion and I don't see it except other type that I don't like but it is a nice app to use!,2
"Overall it's a great tool for posting content! TikTok is a great tool for posting content - it's easy to use and offers many options on customizing posts. TikTok was not a very good tool to target our customers, however, with more attempts I believe it can be very valuable.",2
One of the most addictive streaming video platforms in use today. It will surpass YouTube mostly because YouTube is ridden with so many ads that I can barely get thru a music video complete without pausing for an ad break.,2
"It is good because you can Be poplar. it is better than instragram .it do,not have ads .and I do not care if I need internet. And I can watch people do video for ,Ideas. if you are looking at The rates in Tik Tok. You should Download it. You will like it. Like i do. So Download it Now!!",2
Best app ever!!! I love tiktok!!! I love creating videos 📸 and i love how the video's are short!!! You should install tiktok!!! I love to learn all the dances!!! I use tiktok everyday so should you!!! Tiktok is the most popular and best app ever!!! Tiktok is so good it has everything you can see. It even had Drake's leaked video 📸 Tiktok is so cool it have all the latest trends!!! Everyone should have tiktok if you don't have tiktok it's time to get tiktok!!! GET TIKTOK NOW!!!,2
"I love this app very much! It's so addicting to scroll and see other people's content, or what's going on in they're lives! Ever since I started scrolling on TikTok, I never went back to YouTube, or any social media! This app only has one problem with the slideshows.. when you even click off the app or turn your phone off, it deletes all of the typing you made and it's been very annoying! I'd be very pleased if you fixed that. Thanks, TikTok! I like creating and sharing educational videos on her",2
tictok is astipped down version of the face book app that is designed to be more lightweight and data freindly it's perfect for use whole have limited storage space or slawer internet connections tictok lite retains the most essential features of the main tictok app such as posting updates sharing photos and and vedio and staying connected whith freinds and family it has simpler interface and cuns umes less data allowing for smoother browsing even in Low network condition overall tictok,2
"I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of the application, as it shows such a variety of the human experience. It feels like what the internet was made to be. I understand the algorithm pushes more of what's interesting to me, yet, I am still able to search for other things and have them shared with me without it becoming the only thing I get or marginalized. it's not bogged down by multiple commercials and advertisements, which, in most apps, take away the enjoyment of the experience Asif khan",2
Its the best app all the people with edits and most coolest creations i love it! But kids on the app is too much.. it should be over 14 only! I give 5 stars for how inspiring it is but if there was too many kids i would give a 3!! But a five. I love it.,2
"Awesome app....am having lots of fun, meeting my old friends and making new ones along the way. Tiktok has made me love, laugh, cry, sad,happy all emotions anyone can feel but summing up to be an awesome experience. I absolutely love it. No kidding",2
"I LOVE this App. But the removing of certain sounds because of copyright is starting to irritate me!!!Half of my videos are muted, and i am NOT happy with that, otherwise im enjoying the app...and that's my review. Thank you.",2
"This app is nice! Why is it 3 stars? Because I had a tiktok account and I got off it for like 3 months. Then when I went to check on my account it said I was banned and I tried to see why but it didn't say anything. :( I now dislike tiktok for that after months later I love the app , the glitches are fixed and it's amazing today: April 22 7:32",2
"Can't upload stories or see them. The feature only works one time if I uninstall and reinstall the app again, after I close the app the story feature dissappear. Same goes for the swipe photo, only this time it's missing even if i Uninstall and reinstall the app.",2
"Enjoy TikTok, as something on here for each and everyone, young, old, variety of characters, interests, absolutely covers all. Especially, personally if feeling a bit down some really funny clips as well as informative ones. Something for ALL.",2
Having the time time of my life on this app!,2

"This is my favorite app. It's not just an app to me. It's a means of connection on a level I never knew before. I learned I was Neurodivergent, I learned new recipes, I learned facts about history that school didn't teach us, I learned about the world politics and humanity as a whole. Rip tiktok in the USA. Our leaders are not leading. They're creating a prison state and cutting off the access we have to each other. My life and the lives of millions of Americans will never be the same.",2

Good app,2
I like it,2
"Zero ""tech"" support!!! I was automatically logged out for almost a week now. I have requested an email or SMS text with a link to reset the password. Email never arrives, and texts, when I did get codes or a link, they didn't work either! No more automated responses after the first 2 days. I sent a DM on ""X"", no response! Very unsatisfied and disappointed!",0
"When I add a trending audio track over the video's original sound, the ""Controls"" button that allows you change the volume of both the original audio & the music track no longer works. I cannot turn the volume of the audio track down at all, so it is playing at full volume alongside my original audio. This is extremely frustrating because I want soft background music playing while I talk in the video, but that isn't possible anymore due to this new bug.",0
So many issues. I think every update just messes something else up. I use IG mostly for video chats and all of a sudden I can't connect to Bluetooth and I no longer have a full screen of the person I'm talking to nor do they get a full screen of me it's just two half photos on top of each other. Trash. The sound is not the best if you are in a room with anyone else since staying connected to Bluetooth is almost impossible. I would love to go back to normal video calls. Now instagram is down! 🤦,0
"I've been using IG for years but the functionality has been gradually going downhill, especially compared to other platforms. Constant glitches and features disappear and reappear from one minute to the next. Not user-friendly at all, especially when creating reels. For example, SOMETIMES (not always) there's an option to crop a cover image for the square grid view but even after cropping it reverts back after posting. Also adding sounds and multiple texts to reels is glitchy and frustrating.",0
"Everytime I try to post multiple pictures and add music behind it, it won't give me the option like everyone has. When I'm in the middle of editing pictures to posts, the screen will freeze and go black. I'm forced to restart the app and sometimes that doesn't even work, I have to restart my phone entirely. I don't always receive all of my messages, some will appear and become visible and some won't.",0
"Algorithm is terrible. No matter how many ways you try to manipulate your feed, or pick not to see certain things, the same things are pushed into your feed. Many different times I went through and selected not to see certain posts for a variety of reasons. I come back to the app later in the day only to have the exact same for you page as what was cleared out earlier in the day. Posts displayed in the same order and everything. Over, and over and over again. Meta is peddling garbage.",0
"Their AI detection bots are incredibly inaccurate, which is extremely frustrating. Tried to make a second account to share art and potentially start a small biz (as many people do) and was immediately disabled for no reason. When appealing, apparently taking a selfie of my real human face and confirming a code via phone number wasn't enough because I can't appeal again. And there is no way to get in touch with an actual human when something like this happens. Great app. Great customer service.",0
"This app has become so poor I'm so close to leaving it completely. Tagging people resets the post. Adding photos to a draft resets the post. Selecting multiple photos for a post doesn't work half the time. Basic functions have become broken to the point that I don't have time to deal with the multiple attempts and this is coming from a full time creator. Going to just focus on my YouTube content now, I'll post here when I have time to waste and a high bandwidth for frustration.",0
"The android version has always been so buggy, and it only gets worse over time. Key aspects that should work do not and it makes it hard to be able to use the app at all. Photo cropping does not work and resets any edits you've made constantly. The pin to profile/unpin doesn't function properly. If you open a link in someone's bio in dark mode, it immediately bugs out the whole UI when you return from the link... the list goes on.",0
"I used to love this app, but it no longer works for me when using wifi. Posts and stories will not load at all unless you're using data (and running up your phone bill). The problem persists even with the most recent update. I've tried every troubleshooting fix I can find, and reported it multiple times, with no change. Maybe it's time to switch to a different platform, since this one seems to be dead.",0
"It's gotten worse. Reels keep bugging out, not uploading (even when the internet is good), and then I lose my reels!! There needs to be a backup or just save it if it doesn't upload the first time and/or have an option to physically try again. One reel I waited an entire week with different wi-fi/data and was STILL unable to upload. The fact that I lose all my work just because YOUR app doesn't work is seriously stupid.",0
"So today I get an error message when I try to do anything ""cannot refresh feed"". Message failed to send. Something has gone horribly wrong. I have full bars of service and zero problems with any other apps/ internet. Recent update wiped out my actual ""newsfeed"" No I don't want to only see 3 suggested reels of people who I don't know. What is this? Slowly getting rid of yet another of the few parts of Instagram I actually liked. This app used to be about sharing photos with friends.",0
"Extremely extremely buggy. Even the help center isn't letting me report anything. There are so many things happening where my instagram is glitching. I cant send people photos, videos take forever to send, I can't send voice messages etc. And this has been going on for over a week now. On all my accounts. I'm really not sure what's happening.",0
"Worked well for maybe the first few weeks -- I've been having a constant problem where my DMs won't load, won't show new messages, or are all gone. The search bar doesn't work; no message history and you can't see their response. I still get the notification when they DM me but it won't load if I try to click through the notification. I tried all troubleshooting methods and sent several reports to support but no response even after a long time. Would not recommend as an app to communicate.",0
"I use this app primarily to post content for my clients but I have grown to love to create content. Cool video, cute meter's , reels and stickers on the stories. But recently this app has taken a downhill turn. I can't look up or use any audios, all I get are suggested music audios that quite frankly, suck. I also have to constantly rewrite a reel text 5 times because this app keeps deleting my text whenever I make a post, reel or photo. And it's getting annoying. Do better.",0
"Originally reported in 8/2023. STILL HAPPENING. I must delete then reinstall the app multiple times a day. The app continues to revert back to the old version and glitch out. Stories are affected, missing filters and features like my avatar. My chat themes are a mess.. From randomly not showing at all to missing graphics, there's several issues. After having and using the app for several years, why suddenly are there issues that aren't getting fixed??",0
"How can such a popular, widely used app still have such an awful mechanism for pausing or fast forwarding in a video? Oh, good, the reel restarted AGAIN. If only I could skip the part I already watched! Nope. Beyond being a waste of time in-general and showing you content you don't care about, even when you find something you DO want to see, this app's functionality is awful and seemingly intentionally wastes even more of your time. Trash",0
"I can't load ANYTHING on this app, regardless of my connection strength & if I'm on Wi-Fi or data! I've tried re-installing several times to no avail, along with force stopping & clearing all data. Absolutely nothing. Not only that, but the following feed purely consists of accounts I don't and will never follow. If I wanted to explore, there's an explore tab for a reason!",0
"They continually rearrange the options, making it progressively harder to use. There's no customer service number, and when attempting to delete one of my accounts, it was challenging; I couldn't find the option. Even when I located it, I couldn't delete it because the app kept crashing. Instagram hasn't been the same since FB acquired it.",0
"Every time I try to edit or add a tag , it glitches out and doesn't save anything. This app keeps screwing up my post, and it's croping my pictures in a ridiculous way. I have to use a third-party app to make the image fit. I am an author, and I see no point in using this app anymore to try and promote my book if it's just gonna keep messing up and not saving my edits. Very unreliable. Idk what they did to this app, but after all these updates, they made it worse. Lazy coding and poor management",0
"Can't upload videos to story. Can't send bug reports. Can't log in. Videos refuse to upload and fail at 90%. I tried sending a bug report. Nope. Bug report fails to send. Tried updating. Nope. Tried clearing cache. Nope. Tried Uninstalling and reinstalling. Guess what, now I can't log back in. I enter my email and password, but none of the 2FA methods are working. Won't send notifications. Won't send confirmation code text messages. Locked out and unusable.",0
"My feed is nothing but ""suggested for you"", even though I said to disable it in the setting. It's very annoying. I want to see what my friends are up to, not pictures of cats from accounts I don't know and nothing else. When I X a suggested post and open the content settings, it says suggested posts have been snoozed every time. This is clearly not true, given that I got to that settings page from dismissing a suggested post. Nothing but a headache",0
"A true hellscape of an app. Constant ads, even directly on the profiles of accounts I follow. Far more sponsored content than in the past, and now there are automatic website pop-ups on accounts that advertise to me. No matter how many accounts I block, the experience is soul-crushing. I tend to go many months without looking at Instagram because I hate it so much. Only good thing is the saved collections, because I don't want to publicly like everything that interests me.",0
"Terrible commenting system. It only serves to promote hate and fuel anger and it's clearly done on purpose to drive ""engagement"". Old: I wish there was more control over when it refreshes/auto-scrolls to the top :/ Old: It's pretty frustrating to use. The video player functions don't really work - they also removed landscape as an option, as far as I can tell.",0
"if I wanted to see the next reel I'd swipe. stop auto playing the next reel. I've turned off everything I could to stop it and it just keeps auto playing. I'm really glad insta shows how much they're trying to sensor specific pages, not loading specific pages, videos and pictures. also I wish there was a ""don't show this add"" option. I keep seeing adds for games about popping pimples and I want to vomit every time. I hate the "" invited you to their insta live!"" no they didnt and idc.",0
"I'm not sure why, but all of a sudden I can't use direct messages. I can send it, but after I do, the error message ""Message Unavailable: This message type isn't currently supported"" pops up & all of my messages can't be seen. They're just gone. Idk if this is my account or the app? But it's very frustrating. I've tried several things that i googled to fix it & still nothing. & I'm not the only one having these types of issues. Please help me figure it out & fix it.",0
"Not sure what's going on. Can't post any video to my story, can't use a GIF in my story. The boomerang/video option doesn't work, keeps saying that recording has failed. *Update* I am still having problems with this app. It's been updated, I've logged out, re started my phone multiple times and I still can't post any videos or Boomerangs or anything on my story with a GIF. The only thing I can post on my story is a picture, nothing extra",0
"This app is consistently getting worse. You haven't been able to search most recent posts in quite some time, instead given the option to search by top recent (mostly the same posts as top posts). When you search through follow lists half of the time it takes you back to the top of the list when you touch the screen after clicking a profile and going back. Terrible for a AAA app.",0
"An increasing amount of invasive ads haunt this app. Businesses who aren't even on Instagram and have 10 Facebook followers. For some reason it thinks I am into ""Hair transplants"" and ""Engagement rings"" when both of those are completely irrelevant to me and I've never searched them. I have tried avoiding those topics saying not interested only to see them more often. I don't want to see trending reels on my main page, I miss when it was just people you follow. No way to customize the home page!!",0
"Stories freeze and wont play properly cant use saved audio on a story, only on reels because IG is trying to shove that feature down everyone's throat just like stupid ""threads"" and now, when a video or reel is playing and you try to fast forward or rewind, it freezes completely. Not to mention the fact that the functional layout of posting a reel, story, or post are all different = user unfriendly! It only lets you use pics for stories from your camera roll, and not other folders. What a joke!!",0
"IG has possibly the worst interface I've ever experienced. There is a progress meter at the bottom, but if you try to use it, the video pauses permanentlt. Mute? Permanent pause. Any kind of interaction but scroll up or down? (Which restarts the video) Start from zero. I give up. Jesus people, test the garbage you write before using it to sell my data.",0
"My feed in constantly filled with ads and other ""promoted"" pages that I have zero interest in. Factored in with the consistent bugs encountered, I'm moving my ranking down to 2 stars. Still better than Facebook but it's clearly on its way to making itself a thing of the past, like Facebook. UPDATE: 1 star. Nothing but ads for lip fillers and botox. Instagram is absolute trash.",0
TERRIBLE BUGS OR TERRIBLE APP CHANGES!!! Keeps getting worse & worse! They removed the pause button a while ago - pls bring back! Now unable to fast forward or rewind videos bc the playback freezes so bad. Unable to see the button during playback that shows how long the video is or how far into the video you are. WHO IS COMING UP WITH THESE CHANGES - THEY NEED TO BE REASSIGNED!,0
"Buggy, when viewing the followers/following list of anyone, it often scrolls back to the top, making you restart. Is this a permanent feature? It's been a problem for years. I've also uploaded a reel only to have its audio constantly replaying in the background even after I've clicked away from the upload, it stops once I fully exit and close the application.",0
"One of the worst apps. If it isn't glitching out, the algorithm is keeping you buried. I've tried the boosted ad's, and they barely meet the minimum reach but somehow still get all of the money. Now the like counter is hiding a large portion of the likes I received. You can view them in the insights, but they don't show on my profile. Help center hasn't replied to any of my reports or emails.",0
"App crashes often, features randomly stop working. It doesn't show you posts in chronological order. I just end up seeing posts from the same couple of accounts and a bunch of ads. My feed will say theres nothing new and start showing suggested posts, but then I'll click through accounts I follow, and there are several new posts it never showed me. Not at all user friendly, I just want to keep up with people and share things with my friends.",0
"Whatever new update they rolled out is awful. Specifically on reels. The buttons don't work anymore, you'll press share and it'll bring you to the creator's profile, comments and it'll pause and become non-responsive to touch. The UI is horrible for such a common app. Did you hire children to complete the coding? There's a new auto-scroll feature that I blame for it - and who needs it? I can scroll on my own, I don't need the phone to dictate when I'm done on a certain video.",0
"Videos always freeze and glitch, which results in me closing the app and losing the reel I was previously looking at. I hate that posts on the explore page automatically scroll up. Now I can barely click comments, and I don't like that it pops up ""report spam, post on story etc etc,"" when you barely touch a comment. The algorithm is also horrible! I am tired of seeing the same posts that I saw days ago.",0
This app needs a serious overhaul and update. It is not for androids. Android users are getting updates late and the app is still continuously glitching. Update: 11/16/22 App is still glitching. I'm seeing posts that are 3 days old and it will not show me any new posts. What us going on with this app!? Too many bugs and glitches. When someone sends you a reel it doesn't open on that specific reel. It opens to something else.,0
"Reel editor freezes every time I want to edit a video. When I finally got through it, the video wouldn't post (may have been my wifi so ok on that one). I deleted the app to see if the bugs were just from a previous version of the app. When I reinstalled it I couldn't get into my account without 2 factor auth, and the support page was buggy and wouldn't let me submit a support ticket. So frustrating",0
"Nothing works consistently, this app is a mess and forces me to use square aspect ratios if I don't want to post one picture at a time. The desktop version is worse, after editing and adjusting pictures, almost every time it says it can't post, and there's no ""save as draft"" on desktop so however much time I spent finding the pictures and adjusting them is just wasted. Makes me want to find another hobby, because trying to post anything I make here is a nightmare.",0
can scroll down my timeline with no issue but if I try and go to somebody's profile and view a post or go to the explore page and view a post I get spammed a message that repeats itself so fast I can't even read it and the app gets stuck like that. I have to close it and reopen it to get it to stop but it starts all over again if I try and do any of the things mentioned before,0
"This app is frustrating! The bar for the videos no longer works. It makes the video freeze. You can't zoom in anymore without it freezing. There's so many ads also. Almost every other video is an ad. I keep seeing ads for a mr. breast game that is not owned by him like it says. How is this legal? Their using his name because they know how popular he is! Y'all finally fixed it to see the comments on a reel while in Facebook. But at the same time, it's still messed up. 500 characters is not enough",0
"I've had so many issues with this app over the years, but most get worked out fairly quickly. This must recent one is horrible though. I cannot even open the app. Every time I try, my screen just goes blank. Nothing comes up at all. I can't log in on any of my accounts like this. I can't check messages. I can't see any data, post anything, just nothing at all. I cannot find any way to take off the latest update so I can at least get some functionality back... just everything is blank.",0
"I came back after being disgusted with Tik Tok and YouTube shorts. It is still dismal. They constantly try to get you to watch reels, which is super annoying. I also posted something, and it was immediately buried. Imagine trying to show your friend a picture on your phone, but somebody grabs your phone from your hand and puts one hundred photos on your phone that your friend has to scroll through to see your photo.",0
"Instagram constantly closes out on me, becomes a glitchy mess when in dark mode, and sometimes doesn't open the app at all. Every new update to this app makes it more of a hellscape, it's the dumbest social media app that's out right now. I only use it for art and the algorithm is a nightmare. Just don't waste your time, even tiktok is better than this right now. It's too in your face, it hates the people that actually give them feedback, and it isn't worth fighting for yourself if they wrong u.",0
"Can't even log in properly. I've tried everything to log in to my old accounts. But there seems to be an error everytime and saying ""couldn't refresh feed"". This has happened TWICE with some of my old accounts too, I had to create new ones and now there's a trouble logging in in my new ones too. Too many bots and definitely not a safe place for kids. Really poor service even after I tried everything including, fixing my wifi, clearing the app cache, even restarting my device.",0
"One of my go-to doom scrolling apps, it has been completely ruined by recent updates. From automatically scrolling to the next reel while I'm reading comments, to vibrating each time I like a comment, to ""sponsored reels"", etc. With no settings to turn off any of these features, I can't stand using this app anymore. Don't even bother with this app, just download tiktok instead.",0
"Latest misadventures. For over a month my explore feed has been assorted India/Bollywood, people dancing, generic nature photos, and other nonsense I've never shown any interest in. Many on Reddit reporting the same thing. Like others, have tried everything to fix it and it's still completely trashed. Terrible app. Non existent support, to boot.",0
"My Explore page changed overnight with no influence of my own, the ""Not Interested"" choice on posts does absolutely nothing, and I'm now being recommended racist and completely irrelevant content. I want what I'm actually interested in back, and I've submitted four support requests in two weeks, all of which have vanished and I haven't got a single response. This app is going downhill fast, and I've already cleared my storage cache, uninstalled and reinstalled twice, and more.",0
"The home feed autorefresh is out of control. If I set my phone down and the screen turns off or I look at any other app, it refreshed. Sometimes it refreshes my feed because I look at comments for more than a minute. It's an absolutely terrible user experience that you can't turn off the excessive automatic refreshing. Ypu can't even see the posts from people you follow because it's nonstop refreshing the feed. It's been an issue for some time and Meta just doesn't care to LET US TURN IT OFF.",0
"**Update** Insta has been an absolute headache recently. Since the last update the audio cuts out 1/4 - 1/2 way through videos I'm creating. I create the whole video, get the title ready, hashtags, etc only to find out the audio has cut out 1/3 of the way through the video. This is getting beyond frustrating. I'm not the only person this is happening to though as I've been in contact with other creators who have said the same happens to them.",0
"If I can give the app a zero, I would. It used to be so nice, but it's complete trash now. The app won't read my SD card to post photos when it used to work just fine. It auto scrolls to the next reel, refreshes without warning. Now, it won't let me see older posts of people I follow when I click on that option. It's responsive only 2/3 of the time. I don't know what's happening and it needs to be fixed.",0
"Terrible. Absolute waste of time. I run my photography business account through Instagram and I've just upgraded phones. The app on my old phone was bad, but not now I've updated, I can't even log into my main account. I have 3 different accounts for different subjects (nature/wildlife, weddings/portraits and automotive). I try to log into my main one, it just logs me into another one... so now I can't use it. The algorithm was bad enough, but doesn't matter now anyway",0
"I am so frustrated with this app that I don't even know where to start. What's the point of having an option to crop a thumbnail for a reel for it to appear differently on the profile grid? In reels I work meticulously for them to look exactly how I want them to look, but when I post them, they are cropped differently. Jesus Christ. I like Instagram in general, but bugs like that are terribly demotivating. Please, fix this!",0
"I absolutely love Instagram and think it has some great qualities. However, I am constantly having issues with reels, my sound goes out of sync, font distorts or moves, the quality is blurry/pixilated, and now when I edit a reel it will not save. Also, for some reason I'm unaware of, all my reel drafts have been deleted and I can't see a way to retrieve them! Insta, get it sorted, it's not acceptable.",0
"There's a bug when I'm going to watch reels, sometimes I can like the reels but sometimes I can't. Another bugs happened and this is the bad one. When i'm going to watch the stories archive the video's buffering, even when my network connection is good enough. Can you guys fix it instead of making some new features? i will appreciate that, thanks.",0
"Even my bug report has a bug and won't upload... There is no sound in the video. When I click preview, the audio plays, but once it is published, it is silent. I don't understand what is going on. There is no copyrighted music in this and this is an inconsistent problem. Please help me rectify this situation. I am growing incredibly frustrated with instagram.",0
"Sick of ""Your edits weren't saved, please try again"" error messages. Considering it is a photo app, the options for photo sizes appear to be limited. In order to zoom, you have to hold your fingers on the screen, which blocks the photo you are trying to see, soon as you let go, the photo zooms back out to normal size. No option to rotate phone into landscape orientation in order to view landscape/16:9 photos better. Just not a very well put together photo app. Huge disappointment.",0
"Instagram is a great app. It is very user friendly and entertaining. But nowadays, I'm facing a lot of issues with the app. Whenever I reinstall the app, I am getting an outdated version of the app, and it's taking a lot of time to get updated. Even after getting the update, I am unable to use the layout option for stories. It keeps glitching. Really disappointed with the app lately. Requesting meta and Instagram to fix this bug ASAP.",0
"Painful to upload pictures. Sometimes when carefully selecting and editing your pictures for a post to the feed, the app just crashes and you're left empty handed. When using square frames, IG tends to screw this up and on one side of the picture, there is an ugly white bar. Sometimes on the story when you use a location, the font is below the icon which makes it look ugly. Sometimes when you post the story, the picture stays on the screen after so you have to reopen.",0
Am having an issue with your app. Whenever something is being uploaded on my story it takes forever as if that's not enough. Even when it's done loading I can't switch to my second account. And my second account is my business account it's very important to me. Then I can't even read messages in my DMs. I see them in the notifications and when I open the app to reply. They don't appear. It's almost impossible to get a song using your app. I have to get from other apps then post.,0
"Look, I've been using Instagram for a while and to me the algorithm is perfect eith some excpetions. It usually worked fine but in the months it just doesn't work. I can't like posts, reels,comments or anything without a pop up showing up saying that there's some problem going on. It lags after using the app for more than 10 mins which is funny because aren't these apps wanting to keep you on there for a while? Well at least I don't waste as much time on it.",0
"I only really use insta to message my friends. I keep having this issue where I can't see what they've sent, and it'll either permanently say they're typing, or, I have to go off of the app, and view their message as a notification. It's incredibly annoying and I struggle to message them. I don't know what's wrong with the app. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and that fixes it for a few days, but then it goes back to the way it was, not letting me see their messages.",0
"1. Friend Recommendations on Story and Post Recommendations on Timeline is annoying. I followed someone by accident because of your useless feature. 2. I saw some posts from someone I don't know on my Timeline. Why don't you use the Explore tab? Use that instead of you messing up my Home tab. Or make a button or a setting to deactivate that feature. 3. The caption is not loaded properly, always late.",0
Most recent update is an absolute pain. Can give me the option to add music to one or multiple photos and stays like this for a couple of days when all of a sudden batches of posts with music have had the music removed. Reels and posting stories onto my profilehave also been a struggle to make on the app as it consistently crashes and I have to restart all over again or just make my own reels but on a different app in order to post anything to the platform. Really disappointed in the new update.,0
"I am having a lot of trouble with Instagram these days. It hangs a lot. Whenever I try to add music to my reel, the main audio of the camera goes off. Even when I try to reduce the volume of the music on the reel, it continues to play at full volume. Apart from this, even if the volume is turned down and next, then the sound of main camera audio comes but the sound of music selected from Instagram library disappears. The app makes several attempts to upload the reel.",0
"Not able to post or edit reels! Every time I try to pull a short video I've taken from my phone it tells me ""something went wrong. Try again later."" It's been a full week and I'm still not able to even watch them in the edit section or do anything with them. The screen goes black or green - frustrating. The app is up to date, I've cleared the cache and all the other thing the internet tells you to do and I'm still not able to post reels on any of my accounts!",0
"So for the past two weeks Instagram has been crashing on me and giving me an error every single time I try to open it. I've uninstalled and redownloaded several times, rebooted my phone several times, with the app either uninstalled or not installed to reinstall again, and it just doesn't work. It's not a problem with my phone. Instagram Lite is useless because it freezes and stops responding all the time. I used to like this app a lot but I'm sick and tired of this.",0
"1. I can't find All my saved folders (just the first 4). How do I find the rest of my saved items??? 2. I can no longer see the total number of saved items like before. I need this feature back as it helps me keep count of the number of saved or removed items in my folders. 3. I also need the suggestions feature removed from my DM area, as it creates A CLUSTER. It is also, an unnecessary update feature (since we can always search a name & send a direct message) I don't see why it's needed!!",0
"The app is nonfunctional. I can't select anything without getting a notification that two of my actions have been deleted as spam but when I click to see them, it says all of my content is fine and I have access to all features. If I exit out of this notification, the app becomes a blank white rectangle. If I restart the app, I'm immediately sent to the notification again. This happens across devices. The app simply does not work.",0
"The worst notification settings I've ever seen. I just want to turn off reel notifications. Is that really such a hard feature to implement? It's turned into junky adware. It's also somewhat clunky with how posts update. You'll open the app, see a post you want to read, and immediately, it disappears through the auto refresh (which you can't disable!). I wish there was an alternative. If you haven't created an account yet, don't bother. Meta has absolutely ruined this app.",0
"I'm having tons of problems posting. Constant issues with ""unable to save image"" errors. I removed old photos off my phone, cleared the cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, tried to post via my home WiFi and cellular data. Even with 40 GB free on my phone and doing the above, I still can't use more than 1 or 2 photos per post. I submitted an error ticket and heard nothing. It's certainly not inspiring me to pay for advertising if I can't make basic posts.",0
"I am extremely disappointed with Instagram's latest update as it has rendered me unable to view long captions on posts. This feature was crucial for understanding the context and appreciating the content fully. It's disheartening that such a basic functionality has been compromised, impacting the overall user experience negatively. Please address this issue promptly.",0
"Gets worse every update, videos get stuck more, saved posts disappear because the app didn't actually save it, & this has nothing to do with connection issues or when the original post is deleted or archived by the user. It used to be once in a blue moon, now it happens a lot more often & sometimes I can't even use the app since nothing will load. The auto refresh thing that just happens out of the blue randomly with reels is a new annoyance, just seems there are more issues never being fixed.",0
"The worst experience ever I always have is on this application on android Samsung note10 and all older models, Istg it's as if it was developed by a 9 year old. How many times do I have to report bugs and send emails and feedback for you to fix something!!!!!!!! Everything always lags, crashes, sometimes options disappear, CRASHES again, videos and reels always have this grey filter on them. 0/100 experience, I genuinely hope you fail but after the 🍉🍉🍉 is free. Only thing you're useful for.",0
"I loathe the new update for one reason only. Automatic scrolling of reels after I've viewed it two times. Hey if I want to watch the same video consecutively 10 million times, then I will do so because I chose to, alright?! It's frustrating that the programmers thought it was a good idea to implement this. Seriously you can be the judge of many times I'm allowed to view a video. I'm not a child. Provide an option to turn this off or remove it entirely please. Else I'm switching to tik tok!!",0
"Since having my new phone, occasionally when I click ""more'' to read the whole caption under a post, the caption area just goes blank. I can still see the image, but nothing else. This problem happens intermittently. Sometimes if I then click the comments icon, I can sometimes see the post caption that way, but sometimes not. It's annoying.. never used to happen on my old phone.",0
"Instagram pushes reels into your face so much! It's all I ever see and it's just mindless content that drowns out my feed. It's very frustrating. Recently I have been struggling with loading up posts that I have missed when refreshing my home page (seemingly automatically whenever I click off and back on to it from my explore page) and I cannot view the older posts even when clicking the ""view older posts"" button! I've missed lots of content I want to interact with because of it.",0
"Ever since the latest update, reels cannot be fast forward nor can you rewind without it freezing or stopping or just fully restarting the video, sometimes even refreshing the entire thing so your reel is gone! The worst feature in my opinion is that it tries to skip to the next reel, *WHILE* you are WATCHING the one you're on! Sometimes I enjoy repeating the video or I'm busy looking at the comments. It is so incredibly frustrating and upsetting. I hate the new update.",0
"Experiencing Delays in Sending Messages on Instagram. For the past month, I've been facing a frustrating issue on Instagram. While I receive messages normally, there's a significant delay when I try to send replies. I've checked my internet connection, updated the app, cleared the cache, and even reinstalled Instagram, but the problem persists. This issue is hindering my ability to communicate effectively on the platform.",0
"I can't login my id. It's showing -Sorry there was a problem with your request. I have tried everything and even emailed them but they are doing nothing. That's just one problem there so many other problems also with this app that it i start writing it, it'll cross the word limit. Some of them are: no notes are being showed, no music notes, can't create a new account, message section takes a long time to load, stories don't open sometimes. Wish i could give negative star on the rating",0
"I've also recently started having issues with IG not recognizing my SD card suddenly, and it's been about 3 weeks now. My regular usage of instagram has gone from casual to almost non-existent. Not surprised to hear others are dealing with the same issues. Update, Jan 31: they fixed the bug seemingly. Hoping everyone else gets theirs too. Still a one-star experience cause it's bound to happen again at some point.",0
"Content moderation is the pinnacle of dogshit. Only have the app to keep in touch with friends. I love the everyday opportunities the app gives me, like seeing a fatal car accident the moment i click on reels, but also getting a content warning about a video of a plastic table getting pushed away by the wind. This feature singlehandedly cured my need to scroll through reels endlessly. Thank you.",0
"Honestly your app sucks for Android. You send out updates in God knows what random phases. You cannot improve and stick to a good UI. You cannot fix your bugs when creating reels. I stopped making content because of the ridiculous bugs, for example, zooming in a video clip unnecessarily, taking time to load stories. You could do a LOT. Or just don't. Go back to being basic if you can't handle extra.",0
"The notification system isn't working properly. I am not getting any notification but when I do get notification, it's always late. Suppose someone send me a message at any particular time but I got the notification quite late, like 5 or 6 hours later and sometimes I don't get the notification at all. And yes, I have checked the notification settings of the app and of my phone, it's all good there and there's no network issue also. So don't say that there must be internet connection problem.",0
"Buggy app. Updated to lasted version of my device, app, cleared cache and data, uninstalled, but nothing works in the end. It always ends up crashing, freezing, missing features, or just not working correctly. Right now my UI seems bugged, and also click on posts sent to me via DM take me to the home feed but wont load the post (stays on my home feed). Another bug is not being able to load certain peoples voice notes. If it wasnt for my business I would never use Instagram.",0
"Too buggy and archaic. A couple of updates back I lost the ability to see and select emojis on this app. I have to try and guess the proper order of words to have one suggested, or *roll eyes* It feels like 2010. Difficult to pause and if I << or >> a video, all icons for like, chat and share completely disappear. I need to exit the app and open it again for them to reappear and then of course the video I was watching is gone.",0
"Worst experience lately with this app. Cannot view messages or even reels sent to me. If i went into messages by clicking any notification, the screen goes blank and i have to close insta and restart it. And when viewing the reels shared to me, it doesnt open the reel that is sent to me, but instead opens some other reels every single time. Frustated by this app right now",0
"Had deteriorated so much since I started using it years ago..Can't add music or stickers images to highlight my photography, since Meta took over its completely different. Can't add stories with music. What's the point in having all the 'extras' if you can't use them. Sadly the only app worth having for promoting photography and they know it, so they care less and less..",0
"I have been a long time user of Instagram and it has always been my #1. 2 days ago: When I went on my account, it started glitching, wouldn't refresh, let me like post/story, went onto my page and it's all blank, nothing showing. I tried to search up people and nothing came up, I tried to see my notifications which is also blank. I don't know what happened to my account, it's so frustrating! Hopefully I get a response back from someone here that can help. I don't want to lose my page.",0
"Cannot edit reels, the quality would be messed up and texts added would be distorted. I have to use an external app to edit reels. These days, even location sticker on story is getting messed up after posting. Such problems have been existing since forever. Basically feels like the app exists for only latest iPhone users. Update 10 March 2024 Video uploaded on story getting updated pixelated, even though upload at the highest quality is checked. Please fix such issues, these are basic.",0
"So many updates yet u didn't fix the problem with audio on reels. The original audio was removed from my reel & apparently I get just ONE chance to replace it. I said ok, I'll replace the audio with another one. So imagine this: I choose another audio, this one apparently original by insta standards & it doesn't work. Now, insta says I should delete my reel & upload it again. Look, it's not about the stupid likes, I'm not a damn celebrity, but I don't have some of the photos on the reel. FIX IT!",0
Updates are to make things better or to make it worse? Can't slide the video section in reels which was possible before the update. If you want to just rewatch the section of a reel you have to watch it again from the beginning. It's 2024 and Instagram still doesn't have edit option for your comments. How innovative is that. Need close friend option for post as well like the one in story.,0
"I'm not sure what's happening to Instagram, since yesterday the app has this constant glitch/error. Just by me clicking on a post, it triggers this frenetic message saying ""Try again later. We restrict certain activity to protect our community."" that shows up and keep flashing in different spots of the screen, not allowing me to click on ""Ok"". So, by now I've updated the app, closes it multiple times and I don't know what else to do, it's impossible to use the app with this going on.",0
"I've encountered difficulties resetting my password on this app, and the process seems to be a hassle. They claim they can't generate a reset link due to certain settings, leaving me stuck without a clear solution. It's frustrating when the purpose of credentials is defeated, making account security and login accessibility challenging. I'm quite disappointed with the experience. I request assistance with password reset issue as I have checked all the help center solution and nothing work for me.",0
Tried to set new password several times after forgetting old one. Whenever sent new link to renew it by text it expires within 10s of getting the link. I've been locked out of my account and cant even set up a new password. Doest work on email only text. I click on the link as soon as I get it and type my new password only to have it say the link has expired.,0
"This is an awesome and well functionable app. But it has a critical basic shortcoming - it doesn't allow to unlike multiple posts at once, which is really annoying. Sometimes, it doesn't even allow to unlike a single post which is not good. The app should should allow users to unlike multiple posts with ease. What if a user wants to reset the kind of posts he/she wants to see on the search page. Please provide such a functionality to unlike multiple posts with ease else I'll have to switch.",0
"App and app ecosystems are full of small bugs that just make you waste a whole lot of time not doing anything productive or good for yourself. You make a boomerang, you add a song to it, you try to scroll, the boomerang freezes. Most video posts do not start playing until i don't scroll to the second one and then come back to the first one. You upload a picture of some rotisserie chicken, and they take it down as inapropriated, but a lot of girls and P😮rn ⭐️⭐️ in super reveling clothes are ok..",0
"I only use it because it monopolised social media. Call functions constantly have issues, when a nouvelty is implemented there are bugs along with. For quite a long time you could only reply to text messages and not voice messages, which was frustrating when conversing. The explore page just feeds you content to stay on the app and search for something to satisfy you and those notification dots and marks for the most nuisance things such as ""check it out there's threads"" and then you you have",0

Have been using Instagram past 7 8 years. The new update of deleting any and every comment is so disgusting that I'm about to uninstall this app. I literally comment on something regarding my wishes to gain knowledge and blessings the comment gets deleted as per metas policy. I mention the ongoing dictatorship or speak against terrorism it gets deleted. Even a normal tag get's deleted. How does that harms meta's policy is incomprehensible. This app has become more of controlling and lessconvey.,0
Not showing cutouts option,0

Won't let me deactivate and keeps blocking benign posts with its stupid algorithm. IG might as well go in the garbage. Too many changes to an app that was once fun to use.,0

"Many bugs , my reel caption doesn't show even if I use less than 30 captions.. solve the problem",0
"Recently my comments are getting restricted telling me that it goes against the guidelines and my comments are considered as spams. I even put various complaints but it still say the same. My comments aren't even violent or hate towards someone or something. So, I am giving this 1 star because the team handling to supervise the comments are trash 🗑️. Is this how a MNC work? I can't even comment freely? Your own employees don't know their own company's rules. Literal trash 🗑️. Garbage employees",0

"Please just remove the reels if we want to see this kind of videos we would use tiktok but we dont and thats why we use insta Tiktok offers short videos Inatagram offers posts, stories and igtv just bring back igtv",0
"Worse app , totally time waste",0
"The censoring on this app is getting out of hand. I enjoy debating topics with people and i get automatically banned by the system for the stupidest reasons. A lot of times the ban is just me not being able to load comment sections or my activity tab but i dont get a clear and open ban. So instagram provenly shadowbans people for saying opinions the algorithm dont like and its criminal, dystopian and detestable behaviour from a social platform of this size. Freedom of speach is dead.",0
Worst experience.,0

Tried to set new password several times after forgetting old one. Whenever sent new link to renew it by text it expires within 10s of getting the link. I've been locked out of my account and cant even set up a new password. Doest work on email only text. I click on the link as soon as I get it and type my new password only to have it say the link has expired.,0
When i was trying to make a account i put in the user you gave me and when i clicked agree privacy i needed to click it two times and then i sent me back to the user name and it said this user is not valid. When i tried multiple times the same thing over and over again. I dont know what to do to make a account. Do i delete with the app and download it agian or something? Could someone help.,0
It is bad app. My I'd is baned but I don't know the reason.,0

The new feature of adding the song in your photos are terrible if your pics are in the same size format what is the same ratio then the song will played throughout the time but if one of them is note in the same frame size than the song suddenly stops. Which is so irritating,0

Good,0
Nice app,0
Awfull UI and UX. Plus all comments are controlled are inspected by obviously broken script which deletes absolutely legit comments and blames users for it while ignoring true spam,0
Nice app,0
"I want to know why my filters suddenly disappeared and I can't get them back, this happened from two days!!",0
"There is currently quite a huge issue with this app. When trying to format images in a story, the screen goes completely black and you have to restart the process, upon which the photos get stuck in the 'processing' stage. I have tried every method to fix this to no avail, and am not the only person currently experiencing this. In addition, text keeps turning invisible when you try to write something on your story. Hopefully there will be a fix soon!",0
"The app is mostly fine. I can't believe that reels, which is basically rebranded Instagram TV or whatever it was called, is still so glitchy. I press and hold a reel to make it bigger and get stuck. Have to restart the app. The time slider doesn't work or disappears half the time. And every time I open a suggested reel, it tells me I can scroll to see more. Like as though I don't know that by now. Also, where is the opt back in to political suggested posts? Does it even exist? Or are you lying?",0
"I like instagram, but this app has a lot of issues lately. Ever since updating the app a couple of weeks ago, I can no longer add my own posts to my story. The button no longer exists. I only have the option to share. Yes, I clicked on both the plane icon and the 3 dots and it's not there anymore. My account is public. I checked on a friend's phone and she has the story button. I have cleared storage and reinstalled it, but nothing works. This is extremely frustrating to deal with.",0
"App is okay. At best. 1) Algorithms are trash. Starts on a random feed you likely haven't seen yet, just before refreshing itself to show you a whole new recycled feed. 2) Photo sharing consistently degrades quality. 3) Pausing videos is buggy. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Goes hand in hand with: 4) The NEW problem of not being able to go forward or back on a video while it's playing. If this wasn't an accidental bug, you should probably reconsider. Please fix?",0
"This app is okay. However, refusing to copy other platforms can make it better. Equally, an ever-changing algorithm, constant glitches, and a lack of originality make this platform extremely difficult to enjoy and grow. Even worse, at the time of this review, everything is Reels, Reels, Reels. This excludes individuals wanting to share images, etc. Long story short, it sucks. 😶",0
"I really like it my one complaint off the top of my head is how easy it is to accidentally call someone, it happens a lot because it's just one button idk maybe they could fix that or not either way its a good app. Edit: over time my opinion has changed. Very easy to get hacked, happens A LOT. Bad costumer service I, nor did my friends get any help. Also glitchy as hell, and constantly won't let me do the simplest of tasks.",0
"it's starting to be less fun. I use the app mostly for family, friends, and looking at sports highlights, food, and comedy. The notification icon will say I have notifications, but then it's all ""suggested for you"" but most of the ""suggested"" are accounts where we dont have any friends in common. and mostly spam accounts. Also you can only pause notifications for 8 hours. After that there will be messages and what's in them going across the screen. Tried to turn it off or pause, but no.",0
"The new font is absolutely terrible, it's so hard to read and not accessible (for me at least, it looks blurry and I can't read it easily) and things keep moving around?? They weren't broken so idk why they were changed, it doesn't look great and is very confusing, just keep it the way it was!! It was fine! Nothing. Was wrong, and if there was a bug, just fix that, not how it looks.",0
"It's a okay app. Until recently, when I was told by people they had not heard back from me. I never got the messages! Had to check via browser on my laptop to even see them! I have lost business when I could have used it because of it. On top of that I haven't been able to use the draft feature in years. If I save something to draft, it will tell me only that it cannot be posted. I just have to post regularly. So that feature is absolutely useless to me. I have reported these issues repeatedly",0
"I enjoy instagram more than I like Facebook for sure. Although the constant random glitches and the app closing randomly doesn't make it enjoyable, it is rather irritating. Looking through the accounts I follow, it constantly resets itself back to the top of the list if I even touch the screen. And many more ""glitches"" along with that... Overall, FIX your app, please.",0
"Update is really messing with the app. Anytime I try to fast forward or rewind a reel, it freezes and I have to exit the video completely, needs to be fixed. Also, whenever I try to edit a highlights cover photo, the photo will flip strangely, or it will glitch and zoom in on a part of the cover photo when saving the changed highlight cover.",0
It seems there's a glitch where the bar at the bottom where I used to be able to fast forward to go to a specific spot in the reel isn't allowing me to do this anymore. Not sure if it's a glitch or if that feature was removed. But it is impacting my experience with Instagram pretty negatively because I don't want to have to watch the whole reel from the beginning if I want to see a specific part of the video.,0
"IG is a disaster after recent updates. I'm constantly getting ""waiting for connection"" errors when posting to stories. The story continues to try to post indefinitely and never fully sticks. Cleared cache, restarted my phone, deleted and reposted the story 3 times to no avail. Just a wheel of death waiting for connection. Sometimes the back arrow closes the app instead of going from the chat to main page. Glitchy, please fix.",0
"Instagram has gone from my favorite social media to I don't even want to open it anymore. To force an auto play to the reels without giving us an option to turn it off is ridiculous. Also, being automatically logged out without you doing anything to do so is dumb. IG is slowly dying, and these past updates have given it a violent shove into its grave.",0
"When uploading stories, it says error and the red ring around my profile pic shows, but the story never really uploads. It especially happens for videos and when I zoom in and out on photos while in the story editing. Randomly logged out for 12 hours last week. The whole app freezes if I click pages or buttons too fast. Profile pics show as blank for a couple mins before finally loading. Stop laying people off, that's when all these glitches started!",0
"Even with hashtags no one sees photos anymore - and reels are hit and miss. The editor for reels always crashes and also saves tons of edited videos on my phone even after posted or deleted, so my Instagram winds up with a storage of up to 10gb. For phones with less storage that's impossible. It has a lot of problems even if you don't consider the algorithm completely not caring about small creators.",0
"Bugs kept happening in my chats where after sending a message, the text I just sent reappears in my text box so I have to delete it. And there is another where I can receive videos from friends but half the time it won't even send a 18 second clip from my camera roll, I've never had these issues 2/3 years ago but now I'm experiencing them a lot more than what I used to",0
Dark mode issues on android still has huge problems. Confirmed on both my old note 10 and ultra 23. You will be browsing and all of a sudden the text will turn black and you won't be able to see it on a black background. Or once in a while the background and text turns white. Usually you can close Instagram and reopen and UT resolves. But it's going on a few years with the same issue.,0
"Just started using insta and went through all my pics so I knew what I wanted to post. Whether story or feed seems like the limit of 10 photos or videos is pretty limited. Out of any vacation I have never just taken 10 photos. Trying to pick out of an amazing trip or adventure is impossible. Breaking up feeds or stories is nonsense. Would just stick to snap for stories going away. Gave into limit and picked 10. Hit share to insta and only stories/reel showed up. Select 1 and got feed, fix bug.",0
"Settings do not actually change anything. Turned off notifications from people liking comments. Those notifications still pop up. All the time. What's the point of giving the option to change settings if they don't actually change the settings Edit: still hasnt changed. New though, somehow while scrolling, I got logged out entirely??",0
I used to rate this app 5 stars but with all the issues it's been having I'm dropping it down to a 2 star rating. Latest issue this app has had is the one where a lot of users (me included) were randomly logged out of their accounts. I've been putting my correct username and password and it keeps asking me for backups codes and when I put them it says invalid. I officially can't log back in to my account because of this dumb servers and issues that keep happening at least once or twice a month.,0
"Thank you for fixing the bug but I want to give some feedback. When I was going through issues with my account, it was hectic trying to find help. To try reading all those articles or whatever on the help center page was not helpful. I recommend having chat support. At least then I can have someone to talk to and if it is a simpler issue, they can just redirect me to the specific page. This is better than having to frantically click all over the website, get more aggravated, and feel lost.",0
"I've had this app for years and just starting to really dislike it more and more with every update. I primarily use IG for my stories because the capabilities are better and I can share it to FB with one setting. Convenient, I know.... Until ut stops working the way it's supposed to. I can't even record in my story anymore. Every time I try it deletes the whole thing and says the file type is unsupported. I've actually had to start recording stories on TikTok and just share them to IG, and to FB",0
"This used to be a good app until the recent updates. Reels are borderline unwatchable as none of the functions for them work. You can't scroll up or down without being sent to the main user's page, you can't click on the like button or see the comments without having to tap on them multiple times, and before, the rewind and scroller was broken too. Please fix these issues soon.",0
"My original account was hacked and removed. When I have tried to have a reviewed or get in contact with anyone in any form, I have hit a brick wall. When I try to recover it it will not allow a code to go to my phone (probably going to hacker ) which will then not allow me to communicate with Instagram for a review. I love the platform and how accessible it is for business, but I am so frustrated with the communication side directly in recovering many years of lost content.",0
"This app is constantly filled with bugs and issues. The most recent being my DMs never working on one of my accounts. It has been weeks now and they still won't load despite me uninstalling and reinstalling the app, logging out of that account and back into it. I've reported the problem multiple times and still nothing. What's the point if the report issue button if you're not going to attempt to fix the bug?",0
"Since the last two updates I have been unexpectedly logged out of my account so many times. At first I thought my account was getting hacked but now I think it's the app it self, thought updates was to make the app better not worse but it keeps happening for no reason. I'll be on it then I'll get an error message then I'm logged out. Please fix tired of it",0
"I hate updating this app... because the updates BREAK the app. I hadn't updated since April 2021. It's been over a year and half. The app was working perfectly this entire time. The recent addition of longer story tabs was helpful to me so I updated it. Worse decision... Now my app is constantly having trouble loading content - either comments, profiles, or posts. It just keeps loading or it will say it couldn't load. I am ANNOYED. For context: I have an iPhone as well and it works fine there.",0
"Messages in the app are not being delivered properly. One party will send and the other will not be able to view on their end. It happens quite often and has been very frustrating. *edit - the previous problem has been resolved, but now it seems activity status has been effected across my entire inbox.",0
"Was looking for an update because all of a sudden it's gotten SO buggy. I can't create reels w/o it glitching & me having to either start over, or save the draft & ex out of the app. Even posting pictures is the same way. I try to adjust the photos as I click them, so that they're just ready, & as soon as I click the check mark to continue, it resets the photos completely off what I had designated. If I try to edit in the section that's MADE 4 editing, it blacks out & crashes. Even more issues!",0
"There is some glitch right now where it doesn't show captions. If you click into the comments and then back out, the it will finally show up but it's super annoying and inconvenient. Also the auto refresh is getting out of control; you can barely finish looking at something before it's gone. If I want to refresh my feed, guess what, I will refresh it. If I am not initiating it then I don't want it!",0
"There are so many bugs, all the time. I keep running into the issue of my posts or reels not posting and getting an error message. The app constantly freezes as I'm trying to make reels. And, the Save Draft button doesn't work anymore, I have to back out and hope it saved. Sometimes it doesn't save and it gives me another error message. Very frustrating.",0
"The past few months, this app has been filled with loading errors/glitches. Can't see new messages. They just won't show up, but I'll see them on my notifs. Can't view individual photos on one of my accounts, but they're visible on my profile page. Drafts for posts (NOT REELS) won't show up. Some audios will be perfectly synced while editing, but will end up not matching after posting. It's very frustrating. Please fix. This is insane.",0
"Recent updates have so many bugs. 1) Instagram no longer can see any photos or videos on my SD card, only internal memory. 2) Only way I can add a story is by going to my profile and clicking the + at the top. The + on the main feed screen results in an error. 3) I no longer have the ability to schedule posts. I used to have it, now it's gone. This is HUGE for a small business who needs to regularly post content. Please fix these issues ASAP! Android user if that makes a difference.",0
"I don't like how the feed automatically scrolls to the next post when I'm trying to read a caption. The only way around it is to go to the posters profile, search for that video, and read it from there. PITA. Also don't care for all the suggested content. I never see any content from the accounts I actually follow. It's just continuous suggested content and ads, one after the other. Maybe 10 posts down & finally I come across one from someone I follow. Annoying.",0
"No longer recognizes the SD card after the latest update. It was working just fine before. Now I have to move files from my card to the VERY limited built-in storage on my phone. Pictures sent in messages using the internal camera app automatically lock down after seeing them once, including my own, so I can't always even tell of what I sent looks alright or not.",0
"Had for a while with no problems. But the recent update makes it so I can't actually post from gallery unless it is a screenshot. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing things, checking for updates on my device, and reporting it a few times. It's been at least 2 weeks, maybe? And no change. Note Android user so don't know if that has anything to do with it.",0
"It's nice to use for chat and to post from my phone. However, some days half of my messages don't show up. It also forces you to use the app to view photos and videos your friends send rather than being able to use the web browser. In addition, they recently removed the option that allowed me to share posts to my stories, one of the few things I used the app for since you can't do it from the web browser. Overall, it feels as if it's getting worse. Only get it if you use Instagram a lot.",0
Please undo this latest update. Moving the home bar to the left side of the screen for tanlets was a very bad idea..it shrinks the size of the picture or video we're looking at there's no improvement at all with this change. It's like you guys just randomly switch stuff around just because..there was nothing wrong with the way it was before please change it back.,0
"When I try to share a note, it doesn't let me put music on the note, then when I try to view other people's notes, the song either isnt there, or it says ""song isnt available in your country "". Then when I try to click the more info button, it just goes away. I tried restarting the app and the phone but it just doesn't go away. Please fix it Instagram!!!",0
"Fix the reels feature. While creating a reel the app freezes, if i make more than 5 separate text additions in the reel I cannot scroll down to edit them further as they stack. It will not allow me to save a draft, and yesterday the reel I made disappeared altogether in the ""upload"" process. Poof, gone. I'm trying to use ig to create a portfolio of my artwork and reels are no longer reliable. I've put it off but I think I'm better off making a tiktok.",0
"Every week, I have to delete and re-download the app. There is always some new glitch. Also, drafts is basically a waste of time because it doesn't save the audio you used and deletes when delete the app. UPDATE (12/09/2023): Deleting the app and re-downloading it is no longer working. I simply cannot post reels anymore. I keep getting the error message, ""Something went wrong"" everytime before I post.",0
"Apps not working anymore. I've tried clearing the cache, ice tried uninstalling and re-installing the app, it just doesn't work right. I was watching reels, and it was just fine, then all of a sudden I can't see comments on any of it. So I closed it out and did all the steps, and now reels won't work. I'm able to click on one, but can't scroll down, it's just black and stuck on loading.",0
"I can't even begin to describe all of the issues I experience on a regular basis. This app is the worst. I have lost more drafts than I can count. Hashtags will auto populate while I'm working on a post, and the undo button doesn't work. The albums don't appear correctly from my phone when I post. The app auto refreshes when I'm in the middle of watching a reel or creating a post. I can't see what I'm replying to comments because it appears in a continuous line that I can't scroll through.",0
"Can't post camera photos to feed! Open app, click the plus sign to add photo(s), and nothing I've stored to my camera album shows up! The only way I can post from that album, is through the share option directly from the photo when I open it from the gallery first. This is fine for when I'm just wanting to post a single photo, but I can not share multiple photos to one post this way, so I'm stuck sharing camera pics one at time, one pic per post. The issue just started within the last few days!",0
"This app is literally such a shitshow. At random times when Im scrolling through reels, a video will just pause out of nowhere and not unpause no matter what I do. Also, on the Messages portion of the app, videos and pictures have been taking forever to send, literally thinking of using Snapchat again, lol. And sometimes, when people post on stories, their story won't show until way later than the time they posted it. Even after reloading. And more glitches, too, when posting stories.",0
"Instagram has been tweeking a lot lately, like the chat bubbles are the wrong colors and it's just been overall laggy. Also the lack of songs is starting to really bother me, like I keep going to select a song for my status and then seeing its not there. it's annoying. also I like to read back old conversations, and it's really annoying how when I search up an old message I can only read a small portion of the conversation",0
"The app is ok. The video chat feature sucks, it's super glitchy. Without fail, every time now when I try to call someone, it gives me the ""app having trouble, close app"" notification on my phone because the app crashes. It won't work until I force stop the app, and this is now a daily occurrence. If I disconnect/reconnect to wifi, the video call will boot me off, and I will once again have to force stop the app.",0
"I'm really frustrated with the creating a reel feature as the music will not change even when I click something different. I don't think I've ever been able to create a reel and post it without a at least 1 thing not working. My footage will get corrupted, music won't even be there, or just some glitch happens while I upload. Please fix reels and make it actually usable... Small businesses depend on these features.",0
"Still poorly interacts with the FB linkage. While I get it's not the app, spam/bots lighting my stories up are getting old. Also, would be useful if there was a function so you could approve/deny follows w/o having to set your acct as private. They need more tools to manage spam/bots If they're not going to upgrade the algorithm. Also, even though I turned it off, it keeps saving pictures to a separate new folder. I have tried a lot of different troubleshooting for it.",0
"Ever since the recent update the app has been buggy as hell. I can't tap through stories normally, whenever I try to tap to the next story it immediately flicks back to the first story, and when I try to open DM's it fades in and out like 2 times before opening the messages. This has happened every single update for the past 2.5 years and it's annoying.",0
"SOO BUGGY. It freezes. Currently, when trying to post a story from the bottom + button, it only lets you make a profile post. Sometimes when I try to see who's viewed my story, it only shows the number of viewers, and the list is blank. Reels super buggy. Please just fix it. I should have to close out insta every time for it to work properly.",0
It is soo frustrating when creating a new post & it becomes a 20 min. event because the layout only allows multiple pictures that are in the same orientation (horizontal/vertical) to fit within the frame so I have to go in and edit each picture to the same orientation as the others I want to post just so you can actually see and/or read what I'm trying to post.,0
"I actually hate this app, it refreshes all the time automatically no matter what. (With no settings to turn it off whatsoever or switch to manual) Completely ruins any reel I'm on. Just when I back out of the app to set an alarm on my clock, I come back and it immediately refreshes and deletes any/everything I was currently doing. I can't even look at my history of what I was viewing cuz the only way to do that is to like the reel or photo. But insta auto refreshes so damn quick. It gets lost...",0
"Is it only me or has it been so glitchy lately? Posts wouldn't load and appear blank no matter what wifi or connection I'm using. I've tried force stopping the app, reinstalling, refreshing, every other possible way to optimize the app. Also, what's up with the saved posts pages where only first 6 folders show up instead of all the other folders that I've created? I thought it was another glitch at first, but I'm still having the same problem. Please fix these problems asap for your next update.",0
"New update is horrible, I can't answer a video call unless I call, and the app refuses to end a call. When I attempt to answer the call all I get is a black screen. When I try to start the call again to contact the same person i receive the notification that I'm already in a call (even if it has been marked as missed) and the app won't ""end"" the call no matter how many times I select the end call button on the notification. Sharing reels also doesn't work during calls.",0
"I have sent 4 issue reports, and have not seen progress or feedback on any one of them. Neither do I see status updates on the issue report, and have no way of tracking it. Not even an email. It really disincentivizes users from sending good feedback on the app since it feels so one-way. Would really hope that Instagram can change this!",0
"I used to love IG, but now its seems so buggy. I try to take photos with the front camera and it won't let. I try using certain features and it just doesn't wanna work. I'd restart my phone, restart the app, but no dice 😒 don't get me wrong i enjoy the new features and all the stuff they've added, but these little details really add up on my patience sometimes.",0
"Ive been dealing with this specific issue for the past few weeks and it's bothering me a lot. My phone is a Samsung s23 FE, I don't know if that's the problem or not but I can't upload pitch black photos. The reason I want to upload them is for aesthetics but I can't. And, in one specific account, when I enable dark mode, it gives me more Navy blue ish background. I also can't hear my voice notes nor others voice notes when I'm on the phone. These issues are really irritating me.",0
"When I set the dark mode it appears with dark letters, and sometimes when I switch to light mode, the letters become white, making it hard to read comments. This doesn't happen all the time; it occurs randomly when I open the app. Sometimes, both the top and bottom navigation bars turn white, while all other parts become black. I don't really understand the exact cause. Are you aware of this issue? I will update my review once I find the test case",0
"Stories and highlights used to be working just fine. Now some of the stories won't show up in my archive. Sometimes, some of the stories I tried adding to my highlights won't show up either, even if I've tried multiple times. Updating doesn't work. I've had to reinstall repeatedly. This app is already good, but I hope this gets fixed as this is inconvenient. Edited to 2 stars. When I try to log into another account, app says it's non-existent when it isn't.",0
"Making reels is so painful. The app crashes so many times and all the work gets lost. Sometimes I will spent 20-30 minutes creating a reel out of 10 or so videos which is perfectly timed to the music, and then the app will either crash and I have to start again. Or I will post it, and the music will be out of sync etc. It's incredibly frustrating, and I get it, it's just an app, but if you have like 2bn+ people using your app, it should be perfect.",0
"As I like the content, I hate how much fail de app when you try to edit a photo o video to your profile. For example today I tried to zoom a photo before post it, that's all and it just zoom out when I move to the next screen. I know is something simple, that's why is a deception, I have lost hours trying to edit a short video, that after publish, move the song, the cuts, the center of the image, but even a simple zoom on a photo and fail????",0
"It is awful. As much as I am used to it and actually like it, its quality is horrendous. I have to fight body and soul everytime I change my goddamn password or delete an account. In addition to that, the last update is terribly bad. When I try to change a reel's timing, it bugs suddenly. Honestly, the overall assessement is truly dissapointing, I personally used to love this app.",0
"Too many ads (I'm sure everyone agrees with this!), too much unwanted content and wildly inconsistent between accounts! Two separate personal accounts I can see (mine and someone else's), and the layout is different on each one! We need to be able to ONLY see the accounts we follow as a default, and when an ad is hidden, selecting not to see an ad from them again should work.",0
"Too many bugs.. UI gets stuck at the chats page and have to kill the app to get back to the previous page. At times similar thing happens with the conversation page. Occasionally music keeps going on even when the app is switched away with another app, have experienced musiy running in background even when the phone is locked, have to manually kill the app to stop the music as there's no other option. Chin up dev team, u have a tast at hand.",0
"I was uploading multiple photos onto my public account and suddenly the photos turned into white background with black little squares at the corner. I tried clearing the data and even restarting my phone. This time the music feature doesn't work with multiple photos. Finally I had to reinstall the app. BUT whenever I swipe to the 3rd photo, the song stops and continue again when I swipe to the next photo. This isnt the 1st time I've encountered issues with the music feature. Please fix it.",0
"I find it difficult to maneuver around, and limited wording is frustrating. The Threads part is even more confusing as I never truly know if someone is really ""following"" me or if it is just written by those who want to be ""followed"" on Threads. I see people posting listing a lot of sentences, but I can not, especially in the bio section. This platform doesn't seem to be able to access all my photo albums, which I find limiting. I have agreed to allow Instagram to access my photos.",0
This would have been a better app if all those glitches are cleared and made this app bug free. Some messages cannot be seen even after it is delivered and I couldn't zoom the profile picture. There are more and more bugs that I couldn't list all of it out. Some features are available for some users and not for others. Hope those bug would be cleared at the earliest.,0
"Low support for android, especially high end phone like s24 ultra. Having a few issues, which i would like it improve on high priority, 1. Sequence option, slider is not snappy and responsive. Video doesnt respond well by using a slider. 2. Touch to pause on Reels is too slow on android, whereas, on iPhone, when you touch on reels. It pauses very quickly. 3. Bad camera quality and too noisy. Please fix those issues. I dont know why instagram dont fix it.",0
"Instagram isn't what it used to be anymore. I've been using this app for years and years back it worked perfectly fine. There never were issues but since updates kept coming and certain things changed, there's constantly issues (that are rather annoying) popping up. Such as the inbox not working properly. Having to refresh in-app for messages to appear. Not being able to post or change pfp without the app closing itself, stories acting up weird, etc. kinda dissapointing.",0
There is something wrong with the app tonight. I have tried force stopping it and reinstalling but it keeps doing this really weird thing where the photo/post is fine until I get to the caption page and then it just randomly flips the image upsidedown for no apparent reason. And even if I try to post the updown image I get an error message. Please help! Thank you...,0
"The background music for my multiple photos in a post (not reel) are gone although you could still see the name of the song on top. Also, I dont understand why I can't magnify or enlarge the stories with my fingers for one of my accounts while it can be done with my other account. It's useful when I can't read the captions. Thirdly, what happened to 'series'? It was great to categorize photos.",0
"I consider this app to be something of a scam. The app automatically hides pages almost as soon as you've downloaded them, even though they're still in the app. There's almost 200MB of material in the cache, but you cannot retrieve it because all Instagram want you to do is waste data downloading over & over again. There's some interesting stuff on here, but really it's for those who just wanna look at photos, some of which are very obviously & dubiously manipulated.",0
"To be fair, these are relatable for this stage of the app. I still don't have Notes on my main profile, but do on others and tried everything, it needs fixing. Besides that, please put the pop-up comments back to the end of the video, they are distracting at the beginning and not that useful like this. These experimental updates and feature tweaks are annoying and degrade the user experience.",0
"Everything was running smoothly until my explore page just reset it self. I wasn't looking at content out of my ordinary but the explore page reset itself to posts about politics, architecture and photography. No matter how much I choose 'Not interested' for those posts, or go out of my way to interact with posts I do like, it hasn't changed and has been like that for 2 weeks now. I've done all troubleshooting and looked online but have not found a solution.",0
"After the update I am not able to navigate the timestamp bar at the bottom of reels. It's very irritating because often time I'd want to may be share a video and show a specific information in that video and that feature helped me to watch the video from between or from any timestamp I want. Now just vanishes as soon as I click on that thin bar. Please fix this, what's the point of having it if I cannot move forward/backward in a video.",0
It's really a good app ♥︎ this is my one of my favorites app but there are few problems I've been facing 1. When we click our saved audio and then come back to our audio saved page we again come to the top of the page instead of the clicked audio; you need to fix this :( 2. I can't be able to see my proper following account list in order from [EARLIEST] the list keep me showing same accounts:( 2 star!? Worst app ☝🏻I've got issues😑,0
"If I watch a lot of reels, eventually the app just freezes and I have to restart. Also, they keep updating the UI to be more minimalistic, which for an app focused on photography is oxymoronic. The notifications for comments doesn't get disabled, even when I go out of my way to not get notified of them from anybody. Oh, and my alt account that used to be linked to my main account is lost to me, unless I decide to find a way to bypass 2FA. Besides all these issues though, Instagram is very solid.",0
"For some strange reason, all of a sudden, IG is kicking me out whenever I try to make a post or put up a story. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and still... to make it even worst, it's my business page that is being affected. I don't understand what is going on or why. I have a Samsung phone, not working, I have an iPad, and no problems from to post from my iPad.",0
"Love Instagram, hate how buggy it is. Bugs when I make reels to the point where it will delete all my progress and I have to start again, won't mute sound on reels when slowing speed down, says error when I try to upload any story with a sticker or just decides to upload it without the sticker, constantly says can't refresh feed even when internet is fully functioning, if I crop a photo in a set, said photo goes wacky. For such a high-profile app I am shocked at how awful the programming is.",0
"In the latest update, the changes are very disappointing. The people to whom we share reels frequently have shifted below. So whenever we have to send a reel, we have to manually type the person's name. The person listed when we click on share option are those whom we haven't contacted very frequently or almost never. This feature is very disappointing and frustrating. Please remove the latest update as soon as possible!!!!!",0
"Updated: still the same, even worse, choosing a photo for the highlight cover is so messed up. The choosen photo is not cropped propery, it was zoomed at left corner -_- Also the story uploading is super laggy. I failed to upload the stories many times, the app just popped up a ""an error occured"" and my story just went pitch black. I can't re-upload them because the photos/vids gone with that error, all i can do is delete them. Really, IG, you could do better with all annoying ads in the app. 🙄",0
"Posting here for dev attention. A fine app, it does what it does, except recently there have been some UI issues. On my S23 Ultra, I enter the Reels section of the app, and if I try to interact with any of the interface buttons around the edge of the screen, the app becomes largely unresponsive and locked up, needing to be closed and restarted again. At the moment it's making that big section of the app almost entirely unusable. And worst of all, it's impossible to contact any support about this",0
"Initially the app worked pretty well for me ,but after getting an update the reels are always out of sync with the audio.It takes a long time for me to post anything on my story and comments dissappear immediately after I post them.I hope the developers will fix the issues and the app will go back to normal. It's a 2 star rating for now till the bug is fixed",0
"It was great until recently the dms have started glitching. It doesn't show the new messages no matter how many times I have refreshed and when I scroll up the messages it doesn't show the old ones and just shows that it's loading, sometimes the keyboard randomly disappears.I've updated the app but the glitch is still there. It isn't cause of the internet connection or anything and my friends are also having the same problem.",0
"Dear instagram, this app is fantastic and all, but for some reason stories that I've already viewed would disappear completely from my feed (my story feed right now is completely blank), the only way I can view stories that I've already seen is through going to a individual profile and seeing it again (this problem kept happening even though I logged out/in and resetted my device). Please fix this issue. Thanks for your help.",0
"Since yesterday, message notification is not popping out, only when my friend react my message, it pop out that my friend reacted my message, but none of his message pop out in the notification. I checked the setting in the app and my phone setting, all good, and I even reinstall the app again, but the problem still exist. Kindly help to fix this bug.🙏 thanks",0
"I have been using this app since last year. It's been great and easy to use. Nowadays I have noticed that it shows unusual stuff like the reels aren't shown in the feed, I'm unable to log in my other account. I reinstalled it and it shows that there is a problem and I should try against later. I did try it but it's not possible to log in again. I request Instagram to kindly notice these problems and some other people also maybe having the same problem. thank you",0
"I love this app a lot. But there are a few problems that I face... It keeps getting glitched. It doesnt load chats on time, it's even hard to keep up with the upcoming texts. There are tonnes of bugs. It displays error whenever I upload stories And also, it's a very humble request to meta and it's team to add the scrolling feature (scroll bar) in the chats of the app so that I don't have to scroll it manually to check chats from a particuar date or old chats. Hope dev team reconsiders my issue!!",0
"The autoscroll on reels is incredibly aggravating, there's a lot of times when I'm trying to read something in a reel and it just skips to the next one, and there's no way to turn this off it seems. Kinda makes me want to stop using Instagram all together. Update: since uploading this new review the app has randomly logged me out a couple times on my phone and is now saying this phone is a new device and I don't have access to some security settings for a bit because I logged into a ""new device""",0
"It's been great, but ever since I woke up this morning, it's been bugging, and I can't log in or reply to any texts that I received overnight, and after reinstalling it, it won't let me log back in, it keeps showing up with ""unexpected error occurred"" like um excuse me? Let me log in. Yall better fix your app otherwise a lot of people are gonna start removing it from their phone",0
"Any time I watch any video on the app and try to rewind or fast forward. It freezes, so then I have to leave the video and come back, and sometimes the line that allows you to press on it to rewind or fast forward comes back, and sometimes it doesn't. Also,the likes should be easier to find..it takes a long time to find my likes pic.",0
It's annoying that we can't pause the video. I see some videos where they list name of few books. But I have to watch the video repeatedly to note them down. A simple pause/ play is needed for a video platform such as Instagram. Hire some people from Youtube to learn how to implement pause and play. As your product managers to think...,0
"Too much publicity and the algorithym makes it difficult to actually see friends publications. It stoped being about seeing what friends are up to and instead its about them (instagram) showing as much advertisements as possible. I would even consider paying to stop having advertisements. I think it would be outrageous that it came to that since that was its whole point, seeing friends, but I'd still do it. Also, its help service doesn't work, they do not respond/solve problemas.",0
It's so great you can (theoretically) upload more than 10 images per post now. But this is useless when the app keeps crashing when you try to post. Once it finally worked it only posted 6 of my pictures and the rest is just white. Please don't take months to fix this like you did when adding music was bugged...,0
"I don't like it : 1. I'm not 'close app' just change to another app (minimize app), sometimes sound from reels still playing. From searching -> back home-> sound from friend reels muted -> 'home button' -> soumd from friend reels played 2. Not working after saving reels. After save reels, usually pop up about where that reels saved, but took to long time. But, the problem is frezzing. After saving, i tried to swipe to another reels, but its frezzing screen, just sound.",0
"This app was good at the beginning but now it's completely hetched. Whenever I go to the story section and try to layout my pictures but after I click on the grid/ layout icon it's showing me a completely blank screen . I'm not even able to post a story because that grid/ layout doesn't working, it's very disappointing. Try to work upon it .",0
"So. It's okay. But there's some kind of memory leaking problem I think related to drafts. Every few days I need to delete all data and cache because instagram slowly takes up more and more storage. Like 100gb + with no drafts, no photos, or anything being saved on instagram. Not sure what's up with the editing and posting, but it's not exactly polished. Eg The closed captions for reels or stories nearly never work. Also uploading reels only sometimes works.",0
"Since Jan 2024, follow button is just white and nothing inside, can't navigate videos anymore (fastforward or rewind, bar is there initially but if you click it stops and can do nothing about it), memory leak with app (uses immense resources and continuously increase memory usage and CPU requirements), image quality dropped on videos and pictures in multi-posts (after 1st posted image or video). Still, after months, no way to select all saved posts and unsave all simultaneously. App needs debug.",0
"Why my insta is not responding I got a notification ""close app"" and Instagram is not responding message again and again and again 😭",0
It keeps crashing. Doesn't even stay open.,0
"Must fix the bug, the sound volume goes up to maximum by itself and cannot control it unless close the app. The mute button also not working when the bug attacks!",0
"Instagram has gone from my favorite social media to I don't even want to open it anymore. To force an auto play to the reels without giving us an option to turn it off is ridiculous. Also, being automatically logged out without you doing anything to do so is dumb. IG is slowly dying, and these past updates have given it a violent shove into its grave.",0

"So bad, although I saved many filters, I can't see and use them.",0
"This app is great when it works. I often have to wait a long time for updates to actually get to my phone. With having different accounts, the update will only be on one account and not the others. Sometimes when I redownload the app, the update is completely gone. I've had to move accounts consistently because the app would be on an older version ONLY for that account. It's frustrating. If I'm on the app too long it'll break and I'll need to reopen it. Other than that, it works as intended.",1
"Horrible now. After a recent update, it no longer accesses my SD card where I had all my photos and videos. 3 days of frustration. I read another review about the SD card issue and figured it out. Very annoying. I've used Instagram for 10 years and now this. Very unhappy. *Update Jan 31st 2024.*. They listened and did another update and now it will access my SD card so I can go back to normal.",1
"It would be a fantastic app if the bugs were fixed. Everytime I attempt to log in to an account and error message pops up. I've tried resetting my passwords, opening my accounts from the website, and trying to log in through email links but nothing has been working. The lack in quality when posting an image is also very irritating. This app would definitely bring more people in if the ones behind it fixed the issues.",1
"What is w/ Insta & loading older photos. I can see them just fine in my photos app, so I know they're there, but on Insta they're either greyed out & can't be clicked on, or despite scrolling down it will start to repeat the same few images. It happens everywhere, dms, posting, story. Super annoying glitch! Oh yeah, this has been going on for a while now.",1
"Yeah no. Remove the side bar. I honestly think the old one was way better. It seems like a bit of clutter and too much. It also does distract, well for me. I honestly dont think I can get used to it at all. Please bring the old layout back! But all besides that, its a pretty good app. There are lots of features. I mostly use it to just text. Its a pretty good texting app. :) And I use it to post on my story too from time to time.",1
"You vex me. I zoom in and set t my ten photos how I want, but then click ""next"" and all the photos reset to their original size and orientation. Grrrrrrr Also, duck me if I have to minimize the app to do something else on my phone, because when I go back into Instagram, all my work is lost and I have to restart. This app is both amazing and so so so infuriating to work with. I dread using it to post. Please be better.",1
"For the most part I like the content. Being able to share posts with friends is lovely. I like how you can share stories and even create highlights. I like some of the suggested content or discovering new things. I don't like how some settings suck. Like how it auto refreshed and now I lost what I was looking at. Or how I may looking a reel and it just moves on to the next reel without my permission. Like what the heck I wasn't done yet. I also don't like how I cannot pause a reel, it just goes",1
"App is okay but I don't know if it's a me problem but... it logged me out randomly and when I tried to log back in, it said it couldn't find that account. I tried to recover, I never got the email. I did it again, never got one again. And then when I finally got in, my insta was not up to date anymore. I didn't have my notes dashboard anymore (even tho I did before) and I also didn't have a customize button for my emoji reactions. I redownloaded and yeah, doesn't work. No more notes dashboard...",1
Stop moving the Link Copy option every other day!!! HATE where you buried the option to copy a link or share. So annoying! I have friends that stay on the app throughout the day because we constantly share links. We could do it quickly with the old format. Too many steps now mean we will spend less time on the app! We have tried it today. Massive FAIL! So unbelievably annoying and time consuming. I use the app less and so do friends when we can't find the copy link option to forward something.,1
"Instagram has forever worked fine for me but the problem I've had for a while was the new 'Instagram Notes' update. See, I had it when it first came out and absolutely loved it, but after a few days n' maybe weeks in of using it, I all of a sudden cannot use it. It doesn't show up, nor does it let me listen to my friends notes 'n case they have music because it'll say 'This song isn't available in your country'. I don't know what it means, but if you could help me get it back, I'd be very happy.",1
"Instagram is a top favorite, but I'm facing a snag with the notes feature. Despite updating, I can only add text and song notes, missing out on voice and video notes. Wondering if this is an Android issue or others have experienced it too? Additionally, random refreshing while browsing the feed, explore, or stories is frustrating. Hoping the Instagram team can address these bugs. Love the app, but these issues are becoming bothersome. Thanks in advance for any help!",1
They've recently added a feature where the app will auto refresh without you pressing a button or scrolling from the top. So it doesn't matter if you want to look at the reels recommended to you one by one- you get to maybe two and then it will force refresh after you return to the page. It's also happened while saving a post to a folder. This should be changed as it's incredibly irritating and and I can't see anyone enjoying this feature at all. Refreshes should be the users control.,1
"Posting stories is weird. It makes the video looked kinda squished when previewing and the sound is behind from the actual video. Then when posting it, it says ""processing and stays there instead of going back to my feed. When trying to post multiple videos on my feed, I press the arrow to post a caption, but it stays on ""processing"" and never moves from there. So I can only post one at a time.",1
"Your app is great, but I am annoyed that after the update, the pictures I'm saving are not loading to my Instagram folder in my phone Gallery (yes, I have everything turned on under Archiving and Downloading in settings). If they do end up saving, it's very delayed, as in many, many hours later. Please fix. Thanks, from a long-time user.",1
Don't even know what to rate this tbh. I've been having several problems for awhile now with this app. Starting with the fact that I get notifications of messages but when I check I don't see anything until I refresh the message inbox. Second issue is that I can't go through my whole phones photo gallery anymore! I have the permissions on and it allows access to a few files instead of all of my photos. Please fix this!! Having only a few pictures or so available for access doesn't help.,1
"Since the most recent update, my feed has been constantly updating on its own. If I tap on a post, when I am done with it and return to my feed, it automatically updates every single time. It's annoying because stories or posts that I had planned on looking at disappear never to be found again. I am told that there is no way to fix this through the app, only in the phones settings by turning off the apps ability to have background data but it is still doing it. This is very annoying.",1
"Missing key features. Can't tell when a story was posted. Super hard to pause videos at best, at worst it won't let you pause them at all. Won't allow you to post a full picture unless it's in a specific aspect ratio. Overly complicated: hard to tell the difference between posts, reels and stories. Poor privacy controls: everybody can see who everybody else follows unless the account is totally private.",1
"This app still needs alot of improvement. They will literally downgrade the quality of your videos on reels for no reason at all! Same with picture reels. They are not the same quality as just a regular post! Also randomly zooms in your photos just a lil bit, throwing all good angles off completely! It's not fair because you don't get what you posted. You get a slightly lesser quality, zoomed in picture that's now a different angle than what you posted!",1
"Instagram is usually pretty good but lately calls have been kind of off. Other than that it's really good to make new connections and find content that you enjoy! The last month or too though reels, audio, and like I said call audio has been super bad. Either you can't hear the other or they cant hear you! Sometimes it'll work for s while but then randomly cut out.",1
"it's been terrible for a while now. can't use add yours stickers, can't edit reels without it crashing or somehow reverting saved changes after being uploaded, etc. a lot of these problems seem to be having for years now since whenever i search for a solution, i'll find articles dating from back in 2020 or earlier. the shift to reels in general have been awful. it's frustrating to use this app if it's not just to scroll through the feed.",1
"Dark mode is broken, if i click a link, click on a profile or anything it is white background with white text. Burns my eyes to look at it. Edit: they finally fixed it (or at least made it available for newer phones, if you haven't given in to getting the newest phone every year get rekt *sarcasm*) New issue: I can't use Gboard gif function even though it's better. Searching the same thing on the 'sticker' function gives 'no results' downloading a gif and trying to post it doesn't work.",1
"Videos don't load smoothly anymore. Older reels look choppy now, even if they didn't when posted months ago, despite repeated requests to correct it. It has nothing to do w/my wifi connection or cell service. I upload high quality, and they chop it up. Glitches very often, any time they update, it ruins posts. The algorithm is not that great either. Definitely favors people who already have a super high # of followers. You could have spectacular posts, but no one will see them. Support sucks.",1
I love this app. It's just been so buggy for me. And really difficult because I'm in real estate and have two accounts that I post content from daily. REELZ features is buggy the apps just freeze on me in the middle of editing and then closes. I wish I had the option to save more drafts. I have a modern phone and have even deleted the app and re-downloaded again. What can I do to make it less buggy? And for it to stop crashing?,1
"Drafts option is constantly bugged. I'll get a post worked out & save to my drafts, only for there to be some mystery issue with the photos or videos a few days later. It won't let me delete then reattach the media, so I'm forced to delete the draft & start ALL over again. Scheduling is also NOT an option for my Creator account, even though it should be. A lot of my friends are able to schedule, & even more are also having issues! I've sent SO MANY support requests to Instagram with no answer",1
I've been using the app for years but recently my android device has a problem staying in dark mode completely after I exit and try to open the app again. The screen has pieces of the app that are white while it's in dark mode. Sometimes it causes the text boxes to turn white which leads to me not being able to read the white lettering very well. I use this app all the time I like it a lot it's just that dark mode that's getting annoying.,1
"Obviously a great platform but the updates and features added have been so inconvenient recently. Some people don't have the ""add yours"" feature, some still don't have notes, some still can't even add music to stories. For me I can't add highlights anymore and I don't have the broadcast feature despite the app being updated. Um if this is a problem on my end and not the app someone help PLEASE",1
"Last time I checked, this app was for sharing photos and videos (now). Then why on earth can't I upload ANY still photos. Video will load fine, but stills, not a single one. What gives? UPDATE 10/25/22 So, I'm *mostly* able to post now, but now stories are broken. Duplicating, or sometimes just skipping through a ton at a time for no reason. Fantastic app 🙄",1
"This is a good app, but I don't like how you can't stop posted photos from being saved to your gallery anymore like you used to. I turned off the ability to save posted photos, but it still does it. Not to mention that whenever I select a profile from a user's following list & then exit the profile of a person they follow, it sometimes takes me back to the top & I have to scroll down again which can get annoying. Please fix.",1
"It's great to stay in touch with people and talk to everyone as well as share your creative endeavors but it regularly changes its format which can sometimes making it confusing as to where to find certain selections and there are way too many spam accounts and porn bots that start following you or request to follow you, that's the annoying part but, other than that, it's a good app.",1
"After the new update, if you have to add another photo after uploading the first photo in a story, when you go to 'stickers' and choose the 'gallery/photo option, you can't CHOOSE a particular photo from different folders !! A random folder opens and you get only LIMITED photo options to upload! Anybody else with the same problem? This is so annoying!",1
"The filters are good but when I'm using the grid option so that I could move or edit the pictures, it turns to black. I hope that this problem will be fixed because it's my most fave thing to use. Also, on the albums when we're going to add pictures, is it possible to add an option so that it could be cropped out based on what size we want it to be? Because it's quite troublesome to crop it in the camera/photos app then we need to open insta again. Thank you!",1
"A few examples of bad experience UX. 1. Every now and then I cannot see the actual time of when a story was published. It always says ""1s"" at the top. Not sure why happens, but it happens on periods of time. 2. Expanding a photo poat w/ longer description results in the text being hidden. Any suggestions on how to fix those from the vendor of this app are welcome",1
"Instagram has been coming down with alot of bug recently and it's very annoying. Alot of people are complaining about it but nothing is being down. All my saved filters for my stories got unsaved today morning when I went on the app and it does not all me to search for filters and when I added some filters from other people's stories, 1 hour later it all got unsaved again. Please sort out this problem immediately because it is very frustrating",1
"This app is actually very good. It's the only place where I can communicate with my friends lively! Insta has many functions and features, which makes it more interesting and fun to use. The best part abt is adding songs and stories. People sharing abt what is happening and stuff. That is all good, but instagram still needs to fix its bugs and security level.And I need a new feature that is when someone mentions you in a close friend story so that person should be allowed to mention it back.",1
"After the new update, if you have to add another photo after uploading the first photo in a story, when you go to 'stickers' and choose the 'gallery/photo option, you can't CHOOSE a particular photo from different folders !! A random folder opens and you get only LIMITED photo options to upload! Anybody else with the same problem? This is so annoying!",1
"the app is great but i can't seem to find the music feature where you add music to you posts. i can apply it if i am to post just a single photo but if i wanna post multiple ones, the feature doesn't apply. my friends said that they have that feature and they can post multiple photos with music, i tried updating the app on my device but it never worked. please fix this ASAP.",1
"Hi there, please improve your saved post section. It's difficult to track saved posts not in collections & frustrating to find quickly. As Instagram is used for inspiration and ideas, we saved a lot of posts over time. And often struggled to find saved posts that aren't in any collection. Adding ""without collection"" feature would save time and frustration, making the app experience smoother. Many users would love and appreciate improvements at here. Please consider. Thank you.",1
"Hey developers , please remove the automatic next reel timer or give us the option to turn it off . It is so annoying why you added this feature. And please update you UI so that it will suggest new feeds . Always shows the same reel even after refreshing it. And make is more user-friendly. Do it as soon as possible. The worst experience ever. And also make the video call feature more smooth. It heats up the phone.",1
"As much as I like Instagram, I was disappointed to discover — to my great surprise — that it was no longer possible to post multiple photos or videos from my gallery (for example, Google Photos). Unless I’m missing something, I now have to take photos/videos directly from Instagram to create posts. This is an extra unnecessary step; I now have to remember to take photos/videos directly from Instagram. If I don’t, they won’t appear below “New post” when I want to create a post. Frustrating.",1
"The worst ad experience across all the social media platforms I've used. It's... Yeah it's a pretty big mess, no sugarcoating it. Just scrolling through reels is torture when you get an ad after every reel, but even the feed is flooded with ads... Other than that it's fine, everyone knows the purpose of these apps and their use, just a shame they have to drag the quality so much in pointless ways like this.",1
"One thing I will give to Instagram for is the amount of bugs that have happened and the entire UX has made my social media usage way lower than usual. When I open the app and the first post looks interesting but then the whole app refreshed and I lose the post, I won't be able to find it again, so I just close the app. Now, my feed just won't load, showing just a black screen with everyone's stories above that loaded. If the feed won't load, then I can't scroll mindlessly so I close the app.",1
"I like the app but do have a couple of constructive comments: 1) I don't find the creator tools as intuitive as I think they could be, and 2) it's frustrating that the Android app doesn't register engagement with the OS so that a shorter screen timeout setting doesn't fire while I'm watching a video. If my screen times out, the feed reloads and whatever video I was watching is gone.",1
"The app is really good and all, but recently I am having problems opening it also. When I click the app, it just closes automatically and doesn't open. I have tried many times but it isn't working. The problem is not my network or internet, or anything related to that also. Other apps are opening just fine even the other social media apps. Many people are facing this problem, and I read in some websites, that this problem is having on Android phones only. Please work on that, thank you.",1
"I just love Instagram so much that I don't want to uninstall it just for a minor reason, but this has been bugging me for the past few months. I can usually send voicemails, but when I tag someone's text, reel or a photo, I cant seem to see the voicemail option while everyone else has it and there's not even an ""update"" option whenever I visit Insta's page on play store. Please fix this bug and allow me to send voicemails like others",1
"The app is good in general, but in the messages it has some bugs. It shows the person is online but they aren't and sometimes I get a message notification but even if I click on it the new messages don't show. The thing is: I left the beta mode, and even after I reinstalled the app multiple times I kept on it. I cleared the data and cache but it still doesn't work.",1
"It is a great app for use and like posting stories and pictures, sharing memes and texting, meeting new people. But with all these advantages and nice things some things i would like to state are that it just doesn't work for me sometimes. Like just now i was trying to log in into my account but it just kept showing error and even tho the pass and id were correct. My network is working completely but it just wouldn't load the messages even if i kept reloading it again and again.",1
"Could you add features where u can archive highlights? HIGHLIGHTS, not stories. I think it would be great if you could still watch ur old stories in those collection that u made(highlights), instead of just deleting them, but can only watch the stories on the calender one. I hope u guys could take this suggestion into consideration as it would rlly mean a lot to other ppl as well : )",1
"It's great app but I'm facing a problem so going to give a small suggestions. The problem I'm facing is whenever I'm watching a reel and went to my phone's home screen, the audio of the reel keep on playing even on stand by mode which forces me to close the app. So the suggestion is for the app to know whenever the app is not open but don't want to close it entirely. Because I might want to continue the reel. Thank You.",1
"This app is great. My previous account was deleted bc of a stupid issue which wasn't solved, I lost 29 important posts. But apart from all that, the app is great, the chatting and the reels are all really good. Pretty much similar to Face book but some settings like the close friends one is absolutely genius.",1
"Hi developers. I've been trying to unlike all the posts and reels that I liked and when I try to unlike them all as per the standard method shown by Instagram help centre, it's not happening. It's a humble request to fix this bug cause it's my personal data which I don't like to share depending on which post I like or not. So, please fix this bug and let me know about this as soon as possible.",1
"I really love insta its really good and I prefer it over any other social media app, but everytime I like a reel or post it won't let me and I deleted the app to download it again multiple times but it doesn't get fixed. I also emailed them multiple times they said they would fix it but they didn't and its getting really frustrating l. I NEED THIS FIXED. please. Thank you .",1
"The Glitches are becoming annoying, and so is the choppy recording that happens in the boomerang feature. Sometimes audio from a recording I discard lingers and stays. Only time it goes away is if I close out the app completely. That's a pain when I'm trying to record a moment on the fly and the app has to be rebooted completely to record. The app needs a facelift. Lowered the score to 3 stars for now. I like Instagram, but the bugs are killing my experience. Please fix for Android.",1
"Less follower activity & more random content on personal feed. If you switch apps for 1/2 of a second the page refreshes entirely. No sense of continuity. Just overwhelming, overstimulating hogwash constantly. It's fine at times and was available through the explore tab. Now it's the whole of the IG experience. Hiding posts or indicating you don't want to see certain topics seems to only increase the amount of times you'll see that specific content. Funny memes and wide range of content",1
"I am using this app from 3 years and I really found it to awesome. But there are some issues which I have observed in this app is that whenever I use dark mode, the app interface sometimes glitches to light theme. Also we can't clear chats permanently. Moreover, whenever I scroll reels, every time useless, sensitive and sexual content appears even after I block those. I would like to say that instagram company should work to improve its system and stop showing inappropriate contents to people!",1
"App was good for awhile until now. Whenever I try to scroll on one of those picture posts it won't let me it just glitches the ""try again later"" with an additional text that says ""we restrict certain activity to protect our community"" button multiple times and it won't let me click it. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the cache but none of that worked I don't know what's going on and how to fix this but its starting to annoy me.",1
"I've experienced a lot of slow loading and errors on the app, which could possibly be my old phone's doing but when I try to upload a picture to my story, it says error and doesn't upload. I'm not sure why but I don't think that's my outdated phone's fault. please look into this. it's severely annoying.",1
"Instagram is great for connecting with friends and sharing moments, but the algorithm can be frustrating, burying posts from loved ones. Also, the constant updates sometimes make navigation confusing. However, the wide range of filters and editing tools enhance creativity. Decent app, but needs improvement.",1
"I dropped this app down to 3. Stops working more often than usual, too many updates, and drafts would get erased too often. Too many ads.... I am not on FB much because of that reason, but it is turning into FB because it has been taken over by FB. There have been times I would try to post some things, but app would stop multiple times. IG is a great way of connecting with others all over the world. I am on here more than other social medias because it provides more positivity than negativity.",1
"Um... Instagram is an ok app I mean there are many things that don't work properly like i don't have th option to choose more filters for my story and sometimes it shows me that this song isn't available new feature called notes and there is an option that you can put songs on that note but I don't have it anymore and whenever someone put a song on their notes and if I click on it to see what song it is, it always shows me that, that song isn't available...but yea many features are working.",1
"Is it just me or has the app been glitching a lot latley? Whenever I wat h a longer reel and the bar shows up at the bottom of it of I try to fast forward or rewind in the video it just freezes, and doesn't unfreeze unless I press the back button. But then the bar dissappear in the reel, and sometimes a freeze frame from where I was in the video is stuck in the screen",1
"the random freezes are annoying. They've only been happening recently to do in sure it a problem with the most recent update. Also the notifications are out of wack. For some reason, it won't give me notifications at the time the thing it's notifying me about happened. For comment likes and such it's fine But for chats, it's annoying because someone will message me something and I'll only get a notification like half an hour later. And it'll give me notifications of things I've already checked.",1
"Told I needed an update a couple of weeks ago so I did that. Ever since then I can't just open up reels from people and watch them. I try to open one and it's just a black screen. I have to try multiple things to get them to work. Went back to the play store, it said I needed to update it, so I did. Same thing, black screen. Yesterday went into the play store and once again it says update. So AGAIN I update it yet nothing changes. 3 updates in like 2 weeks and it worked BETTER before!!!😡",1
"Initially, rating was 4 due to the distraction caused by it but now 2.5 actually. Because, whenever I upload a story the audio isn't attached. I've added story and deleted multiple times to ensure audio is attached along meanwhile many people viewed it and don't understand why deleting and uploading again and again. Next, I liked a font and selected it but after story's published the font style is changed. Whole theme is gone. Develop meta!",1
"Kindly fix these, 1st is why do I always find trouble posting my pictures as they're, you're always pushing me to crop or first grid before it can fit your square provision. 2ndly, why is it possible to delete from multiple photos for a single post and not for other pictures, 3rdly, downloading music to fit in my posts really sucks, I used to think it's network but nah, you guys need to fix this! And lastly, stop crowding our news feed with ads, there's a reason I don't follow everyone. Respect",1
"I would really love this app, and I use it to follow and explore people on the internet. It has an issue, though. When I watch lives, the audio of the persons live goes slow and deep,so when their talking, it sounds like a robot. Lately, I've had this thing show up on the middle of the screen that says,""Try Again, we do not accept restricted content"" or something close to that. I don't know what their talking about usu. Usually, I'm just looking at my following and liking their post. Please fix!",1
Firstly whenever I want to post smth with a song it sometimes doesn't even post on my story 💀 next is that when I make a good post it posts onto Facebook as well for some reason when I never wanted it to be? And third of all whenever I accidentally add a picture or video then scroll I have to find that photo or video to delete it I cant just tap to delete and the bottom of the screen and can you add a smth when you can post more then 10 photos or videos + you can add highlights from photos ;),1
"It's great social media app having extensive features but still some features can be added to make it more user friendly and enhance user experience like edit a comment. One feature that i think would be beneficial if added, is add or remove a song from the posted photos any time.",1
"The last update was horrible. You put a simple comment( no hate, no mean concept and nothing) and suddenly instagram remove it and then send you alot of notification and alert that ""we remove your comment"". Like OK? I got it in first alert why you send alot of alerts and not letting me see my page? And you can't do something at least to solve this problem. I'm sooo disappointed and angry because of it.",1
"It's a Social Media app. It works as intended, however, since Facebook bought it, you can't post anything political, (right wing) or risk losing your page. I have been tagged as ""Spam"" many many times. Couldn't comment for a bit. I doubt this will be rectified, but it would be nice if it was. Also, reporting pages that actually are offensive does nothing, as nothing is done. + IG needs constant updates, but hardly anything changes.",1
"It’s very great app...But I've a disgusting problem... Why the songs attached with my photos are not audible? When I post any single photo with song, this is audible beautifully, but but but when I post a group of photos with song, this is not audible, why is this happening to me?... This is very annoying, embarrassing and much more irritating... Plz do something effectively, humble request to you🙏",1
Personally I think this app used to be good but constantly posts don't play or don't load. It crashes constantly and says I have notifications when I don't. I've tried checking my wifi and there's nothing wrong with it everything else in my home works fine and runs smoothly. So I was wondering when are u guys going to fix these problems and optimize Instagram? 2024 these same problems still happen. Every time I join a live the audio is slowed down immensely,1
"The app used to be very easy to use and it would actually respond , now the app crashes and glitches a lot , and reels I'm so surprised that Instagram has had reels for so long yet it's a glitch just all-around, inconsistent video quality , random freezing with only solution to restart app , sending a reel and it appears as a different video to other people(not what i sent) or the the rewind and fast forward bar dissapears sometimes , its there for the start of a video then it dissappears.",1
"Great app for the most part, but have been trying for over a year to get notifications to work like I have enabled. I am still not getting push notifications for posts of accounts I follow and enabled. As such, I am missing important updates. I have tried all of the normal tips and still not working. Based on my searches, seems to a recurring issue for other users as well, but still no fix.",1
"I want to mass unlike everything for personal reasons 😉. However, when I selected 100 items in the likes tab and attempted to unlike them, an error occurred. Now, I'm unable to unlike anything individually. Could you either add a feature that resets all likes (unlikes everything) or fix the select function to work properly and not just show an error every time? PLEASE FIX THIS IN SOME WAY 😭",1
There is a bug I believe on the saved collection. I've got more than 6 collections but when you go to the collection it shows only 6 and it's not scrolling down to check the rest. You will have to create empty one so it expands and then you can check. But when you save a post from your home page it shows all the collections but not when you goto saved collection,1
"OK, but complacently awful interface on mobile, and worse still on anything else. Totally inconsistent behaviour between platforms, but at least the Android version lets you edit posts most of the time unlike others that just spin and spin... If they fixed the aspect ratios not working properly (Windows app version is the best for this, but fails in other major ways) it would be worth an extra star at a pinch. New bug: notifications missing the associated image; reported twice, no sign of a fix.",1
"The app is great, you can express yourself through your content. But they're adding more and more functions and I think it's too much.. I always get updates only on my 2nd profile and not the principal one. Creating or editing reels directly on the app is almost impossible.. everything glitches and loads for ages, including dms. If you do something do it good, or don't do it at all. This is my opinion, my personal experience.",1
"Instagram was really good but it gives me notification like someone posted new reels and when I checked it out & hit the heart button it won't turn to red. It always happen everyday so I always check it here in play store if it needs an update, but if not I just close the app & open it again. It's so hassle doing it all over again, can you just fix that. I keep updating this app but that issue never get resolved",1
"Personally, I would give it a higher rating if there was one exception for me, and for a lot of other people that want as minimalist of an experience as possible or just want to be clean from their Ins. experience: to be able to remove all likes and comments at the click of a button, much how you can clear your website history in the settings. That would be astronomically appreciated.",1
"Normally insta is super good. But rn it's been so difficult to deal with. From me not being able to pin or un pin posts, trying to post a bunch (I'm a cosplayer) and all a sudden I can't add captions, not getting texts unless I open the app. Idk if it's just mine or not but it's super annoying and I wish it would be fixed.",1
App pushes spam notifications all day long. If you check settings there are almost 30 different types of notifications and only 4 types are essential and everything else is completely useless waste of your time and attention. I actually have my own life to enjoy instead of this. No I didn't turn off these notifications I actually deactivated my accounts with Meta,1
"Please change the mechanism of sharing reels on story. It seems like first the reel is downloaded from your server into my device then re-uploaded to put it on the story and it takes a lot of time. Make the process in such a way that it just gets transferred within your servers, so that it saves time and sim user's data pack.",1
"I wanted to try the new feature to limit a post to a specific audience. Unfortunately, this option is nowhere to be seen, despite the app being up-to-date, etc etc. My friend has it, though. We both have Android devices. I tried to find an answer online, and it seems that a lot of people have this same issue. Disappointing.",1
Pretty great app I've had my account for a long time but issue is I can't see other people's notes or even have that feature to make a note. Lately I've been having issues with it too because it won't let me post story's with music in them.,1
"I have a 144Hz display. My adaptive refresh rate is turned ON. 1 month before, everything was fine. But from past 10-15 days, the screen is very laggy. I think adaptive refresh rate is not working fine with this app. I'm using other apps, they work just fine with adaptive refresh rate.",1
"It's nice but it is very biased on who it gives the blue ticks to, doesn't really do anything about the hackers, there should be an option to replace any pictures uploaded previously which isn't looking nice anymore. Doesn't give the real content creaters to a ground to express",1
"Instagram as a platform is good, set up in a way that removes a lot of the toxicity you encounter on Facebook. However, as others have said updates are continually causing issues. Right now I'm unable to remove links in my bio. Also, they're pushing Threads *SO* hard, and it's a useless platform that just shows you people you're already following. Stop pushing it. You'll get better reviews and therefore more (loyal) users when you stop breaking your own app each you 'update' it. Do a better job.",1
"I live in Pakistan. Instagram is not working properly here. Errors keep on occurring while creating new accounts, getting verification codes, uploading stories & reels, and uploading highlight covers. Many of my friends also reported the same issues. Please fix them as soon as possible.",1
Today I face an issue... My selected effects and fillter should be removed and while I search filters they are not searching... And I should also update my app few days back. After that I should face this problem on my app while making reels .. I am not select any filter while making reels.,1
"I've always been encountering error in posting/uploading a story. It won't let me add text, GIF, even music for it to sucessfully upload. When i post plain videos, photos (photo layout) without text, music, etc., it will be uploaded. Why is thissss? I tried to install and uninstall, still the same error☹️",1
"Its a pretty nice app to interact with ur friends and to know about their life in general. Imho a nice way to improve instagram as a whole is if there's an added function to pick what should be recommended in my home page based on what i like! :) Honestly, if it is possible, i hope i would hv the option to choose not to receive content based on following's likes unless i allowed so, and it would be better if i could select whose liked post could come up my recs.",1
"Slowly fixing itself, but still good. I feel like I'm behind on an update because my friend's Instagram is different when it comes to liking posts with a red heart, but I'm still stuck with the old white one, and every time I go to look, there isn't a new update.",1
"This app used to be good. Lately, I have been facing many performance issues viz unable to load followers/following list goes on in loop and repeats after only 10-15 users, the app doesn't load the conversation and comments sometimes irrespective of your internet connection 😑. The app can perform well if this feedback and others like these are taken into consideration and help it fix.",1
Overall the app is perfect but there are some issues like I have uploaded a story with a song and added it to highlights but now the thing is that it's showing that the song is currently unavailable and in some the song is not playing..I hope the issue is resolved as early as possible..,1
"Suggested features: -Feed only refreshes when you refresh it. -Reels can be paused and rewound. -Entire reels can be shared without cutting it to 10 seconds. -GIFs from your keyboard can be used. -Content moderation is currently tighter than Club Penguin moderation, loosen that up. -Search in chats. -An actually functional search engine for posts and comments. -Download images from posts. -Post images as comments. -Use any font in stories. -React to posts and comments. Many more opportunities..",1
"I used to use Instagram a lot but for some reason I notice missing features every time I get in, I thought it was a bug when I couldn't chose the time on reels like I used to, the bar disappears when I click once! I hated it, and lots of people complaining about the same things! It's a disappointment..",1
"I used Instagram almost everyday, but I updated to a new version and I've noticed that I can't see comments on a post. I've uninstalled and reinstall, but the issues are still the same. I also noticed that my saved folders were disappearing. Kindly do something about this.",1
"All the new updates don't update at the same time across all my profiles, sometimes it's like using two different apps with how much differently they update. I also wish instagram had a feature to be staying at the same place in chat while replying to an old message, instead of coming all the way down to the new message I just sent. I have to scroll up back to infinity.",1
"Reels got broken, I can't scroll through the video to a point when INSTAGRAM INVOLUNTARILY REFRESHED my timeline so i got cut off from watching it. It's so frustrating, can you just not do it unless I SAY SO? goddamn it's not that hard. I can't scroll/skip the video because every tool/control disappeara and video freezes. I have to open it again and watch from the start.",1
I've been using this app since many years N I'm glad to say that it's amazing but day by day it is creating problems in every feature.... Some kind of time limit is been setup on reel which I cannot even extend nor could turn it off.... N the second one is worst I cannot even take the screenshot of the chats as it says that it's restricted due to community guidelines why I can't even share the screenshot of message I receive.... I think Instagram should work on it asap!!!!,1
"I've been using Instagram for many many years now and only recently have I run into my biggest problem with the app. I go to send someone messages and even though it works for a little while soon it'll stop sending them to that person. I'm still able to receive messages from them, and send messages to other people. It's happening every day on all of my accounts and it's very frustrating. Im not sure what to do.",1
"This app used to be amazing for photography, art, small businesses, but lately there have been many bugs and the app barely wants to run! If there was a comparable app from another company I would leave instagram forever!! Bugs include notifications that will not go away once read, and message requests that will not pull up.",1
Whatever recent update that instagram decided it was a good idea to make Reels autoscroll without a way to turn it off is super annoying. I'm starting to get really pissed off when I'm trying to read comments on a reel and I close the comments and it's moved like 4 reels on its own in the background.,1
"You can add a translator feature for reels, either in text or audio format. Reels, such as podcasts or dramas, are often in different languages, and not everyone can understand every language. Therefore, having a translator feature would make it easier for users to understand them clearly.""",1
"New updates are making it worse. I don't want to scroll by songs in the background of reels. I don't want more suggestions in my main feed. I'll go to search. I don't see posts from friends I follow until several days later, but new folks I follow, I'll see their stuff from weeks ago before? That makes no sense. Set it back to how it was 2 years ago. The additional ads are getting to where I'm considering tik tok so I can see the content of folks I actually follow as they post them.",1
"Although a very good app to connect to people and explore the internet, it still has few flaws software wise, it doesn't give me access to few options, basically few options in the settings just disappeared, in my case it was account ownership and management settings. Please fix such issues.",1
"doesnt show followers new post content, only a select few and keep appearing in my feed, ads now show consecutively in stories after 2 stories preview....do not approve, quality is declining, every time i try to share a video post to my story, the loading screen doesnt progress and theres no preview....loading screen never finishes",1
"Instagram was fine until lately when I try to upload my work, I notice a change in the photos. Some details are not showing, colors are being changed. I don't work hours on a project for it to be changed or compressed for a faster upload. Everything was working just fine why the sudden change?",1
"There could be many more features. Like being able to copy and paste texts if only to translate it correctly. Most psts have no translation feature and if so, only partly or wrongly translated. Also uploading stories or videos have limited options. And so many more things..",1
"I usually love Instagram. Great for talking to friends, etc. But for the last few days, my reels haven't been playing at all, and only every about 2 in 10 reels will play, the others will just stay frozen, and it's very irritating. Hopefully that can get fixed :)",1
The latest update has some problem. I can't write some text with translucent background. It's either no background for text or opaque background. Earlier when we could do that it was good to create translucent backgrounds of different sizes. Please fix it.,1
"Everything about this app is good, but some time app freeze nothing in the app work, but this not annoying I can restart the app and the app again work properly but one most annoying frustrated mistake while watching reels., I selected (not interested ) in particular reels but again this type of reels come again and again please solve this issue Thanks you",1
The notification screen has changed for the worse in the past month. When you click on the notification item the photo doesn't appear anymore so you don't know which photo was liked. OK. It has just been fixed in last release.,1
"The app is not do great,Posting and reels are not bad,but for many The live stream feature is not working.Keep getting error message saying this account is not eligible for this feature at this time.Have contacted instagram by sending a a message to report issue,get no response back and feature still don't work.Get no help from support team at all",1
"I've been using Instagram for a long time and it has been an absolute best app for me when all of a sudden after the update, it kept saying that I couldn't refresh my feed.Ive been resetting my phone, checking the WiFi, and checking on the app for more than 5 times and it just was the same.Please fix this issue asap 🙏",1
"Uses a lot of battery and on my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra reels lag when viewing the reels' comments in the overlaying comment list dialog. The content is great but please do some basic levels of optimization, especially if you're going to track user interactions within the app so heavily that it drains battery so much.",1
"Constant issues surrounding stories and highlights at the minute. Stories unavailable to add to highlights, unable to watch through or skip through highlights it just keeps restarting the first one. When editing a story it seems to freeze. Small but frustrating issues",1
"The amount of problems recently is crazy. More often than not the post button will completely disappear, the reels play out of sync, and chat backgrounds just disappear, and you have to put an on and off setting for those haptics",1
"Full of fun and entertainment but one thing is very annoying for me that it takes some minutes, sometimes even hours to a message to be sent. I tried everything to fix the issue but in vain, I reinstalled it, updated it and cleared the cache but nothing worked. Please fix the problem.🙏🏻🙏🏻",1
Having a lot of bugs in the application while using the most common bug is refresf feed & network request failed please try again after some time. And one more thing is I can't able to send reels in the group chat but my friends are able to send reels in the group please solve the bugs as soon as possible 🤷‍♂️,1
"3/1/2024: UPDATE 11/1/2022.. Great to use to get your request / message / info out in Meta world!! Good to keep up with gossip {results & info depends on who you follow} Pitfalls: Can be very hard to find your own friends -- Way too many look-a-like accounts, easy to follow wrong one -- Difficult to navigate they need to add a help page indicating use of the many many icons Overall: I would reccommend!!",1
"Very good social platform, not a lot of scams, Instagram does a very nice job to make sure privacy, and security for the most part is safe, but I did have someone make an account of me asking for money to my friends. Would be careful and recommend putting your account on private so you avoid situations like that. Nice for kids to communicate through and is safe. You are able to chose to view things you are sent, nice to post your adventures.",1
I am facing some glitches in the app which are not resolved even after reporting the problem to the Instagram official site but there's no response... I am listing those problems here hoping that they would not be overlooked and come up with the solution ASAP 1. I am not able to create my broadcast channel in any of my accounts but it is available in my friend's account with less followers and interaction 2. As per i click on add note on the messages page it crashes for no reason..,1
"There are several glitches that continue to be unresolved. Mostly, these occur when posting multiple images. A company with as much capital and resources as Meta should be able to rid platform of these bugs, but they have remained for what feels like years.",1
"Hey, I am facing a strong glitch on Instagram. I am unable to see the 80-90% likes of my boosted reels. When Instagram was simple, everything was fine. Now you keep updating and adding features daily, this is affecting many users in many ways. Please fix the problem.",1
Bring back the feature in which if we select the comment section video minimises not completely hides like the current one.That was far better than the current one.Also add option to delete uploading story. Sep 2023 bring back unsend option for dm to people not following us. Also now sometimes Another reel comes when i open reel sent my friend.,1
"They do not allow partial nudity as well and are willing to suspend you if you do. It's ridiculous, but it is still getting there in regards to better improvements in customization. Still, they need to keep track of hackers and schemer's who offer you something with them only to rob you at the end.",1
"Advancing through reels is no longer working. I seldom look at an entire reel. I look at the beginning, then scroll right to see the result. I hope this is a glith and not intentional. If it remains this way, I will no longer watch reels. This is a waste of time.",1
"Hello Instagram. Ive been facing few issues on this app from previous few months . I'm unable to view people's stories, see the messages and it takes too much time to load. Even after refreshing multiple times I'm unable to view anything. Please fix this issue as soon as possible",1
"Another social networking app. I find Instagram slightly complex when it comes to use & navigation. Add friends, comment, like/unlike, stories & more. Similar to it's original predecessor Facebook only seems to have an extra level of privacy, & content is more so user defined or customised.",1
"There are a couple of issues with the Instagram app. Firstly, I can't drag the video forward using the progress bar; it disappears when I try. Secondly, I'm receiving friend suggestions in the notification section even when there are no actual notifications. Please address these problems.",1
"As an android user, it's very frustrating uploading multiple pics in a post. The editing and fit of the photos are always out of the frame. That's the only complaint I have. Otherwise, app is good.",1
Since the last app update on my Google Pixel 6A the Instagram videos have started stuttering and full of lags when I use Bluetooth headphones. When I disconnect them the videos play just fine. This doesn't happen with any other social media or video streaming app.,1
"Update from 1/30 seems to have fixed the SD access issue from the previous update. Good improvement. The rest of the updated features are ok, but it's clearly more geared towards ""content creating"" rather than just sharing photos.",1
Latest update made the issue with the feed refreshing much worse. It's constantly refreshing when scrolling and clicking out of the app (not closing it). Very annoying and can't keep up with posts. Also routinely shows posts that are 4 - 5 days old & videos are buggy/freezing.,1
"I have some suggestions for the developers of Instagram app who's job is to enhance certain basic features, 1. Please put a sort and filter option in saved posts /reels just how it is in the ""liked posts"" , it makes user's life easierrr. 2. Bring back the ""share comment"" option. 3. Please make a feature to copy the comment as well (this is very useful when trying to copy and paste links).",1
"This app now freezer on mid story/video and when I click to view the video on fullk screen or go to the original video, it changes the colors on me. This app auto updated 3 days ago. Why does it keep getting worse? And all the ads are getting out of hand! Geeze, I quit this app.",1
"2/26/24 When you try to stop the noise/song when watching a video, it stops the whole video, it does not continue playing like before. I also cannot not delete a censored video from my saved videos. 2/26/23 You can't save text or pictures someone sends you direct anymore. Update doesn't allow post notifications anymore.",1
App is fine. The problem am facing is that whenever I try to change the pfp or the highlight of stories it just randomly shifts the alignment randomly and not to the one I set while editing. This is utterly ridiculous can't change pfps rn. Tried clearing cache and updating nothing worked.,1
"Keeping status is really getting difficult these days recently. Some unknown error , screen is displaying simple error and then posted status gone. Tried multiple times cleared vache and all but still doesn't work. This issue keep on repeating resulting in losing an interest to keep status and using Instagram",1
"Good grief, I hardly ever use this app, so why it's constantly crashing is beyond me. I have to clear the cache and data and reinstall it all the time. Instagram needs some serious competition. Too bad anyone who tries to compete gets steamrolled to death or bought out.",1
"Enough of the updates! Requires a completed version. Everytime the app updates even if the auto-update mode is disabled, ""giving random bugs each time."" If you provide an usable version like meta's whatsapp, Pretty sure this app will skyrocket. Nice filters, Great communication and all....But BUG IS BUG!!!!",1
Id give it a higher rating but I notice some of my live videos are cut short & the background sound from the recorded video is muted by your admins...and the music picked from your list of music for my reels have also been muted in some of my reels..not sure why..but other than that I enjoy Instagram.,1
"Instagram is a great app but today I uploaded a reel after a few time the audio gets unavailable and few times later the video is deleted automatically, i putted a lot of effort into that reel but you all just randomly deleted even it doesn't have any offensive item????? Or any nudity??? I have seen a lot of nudity content which could easily be found in Instagram but Instagram hasn't taken down any type of reel that contains nudity, it's really annoying I want that reel to be available please",1
"Your guidelines are confusing. I commented a message to my friend to praise her for treating herself to some electronics (selfy stick) that would be handy for her business, and I received a notification that it was removed because it didn't meet the guidelines. I was confused. But the editing side of things. Can improve with more editing tools like capcut.",1
I love Instagram so much it's an amazing app but I've been struggling with a bug everytime someone follows me my followers go down and they are stuck between 610-613 which I had passed long time ago and on some people's phones it's showing 624 and stuff so I just wish they could fix this bug so I could grow my account in peace because this thing isn't nice at all and I'm really stressing out from it hope y'all fix it ❤️,1
After updating the app reels are not working in my phone... Some of my friends are sending me the reels and I click to watch the video then it's not working reels are stopped just like pause and audio is working properly kindly just check what's happening,1
"I like instragram, but I'm not a big fan of the update, which will only show me top posts and recent top posts. I used to like seeing nature Photography in real time from users all over the world. I find this limiting and not very creative.",1
"Too many glitches and bugs are present in the app. Some of my stories keep on disappearing from archives, and the music doesn't load properly. These are two of the many problems present in the app.",1
"Great app. When I comment, a lot of times Instagram deleted my comments because they ""violate their agreements as spam."" They don't. I can't even comment now most of the time. It keeps getting worse. If it wasn't for this very annoying bug, I would rate it a 4 or 5. Please fix this issue. I want to enjoy this app to its fullest. Because if not I may just not comment. Also, every time this happens, it keeps showing me the message that it was deleted even when I go back so I exit the app then 👍",1
"i just uncheck from beta programe i am not able to see all music option in Instagram post section but i am able to see music in story music section please fix it . Update:- it's fixed But There is another problem , my Instagram post audio unavailable symbol on post which is irritating, fix this . Update:- it's also fixed",1
"Instagram should allow people to edit the songs after posting as a post in the feed. Most of the time the songs become unavailable and the post stays blank, so there should be an option to edit that and change it into a new song instead of keeping the post bland. 🤦🏻‍♀️",1
I try to download on my profile and it keeps saying can't download. Instagram seems to freeze more than it should. I love seeing posts about my favorite stars. I love being able to communicate with my friends and family. I love seeing what's going on in the world. I love seeing the fashion and music that's out there too,1
"I am hoping Instagram can rectify this for me. I haven't had my profile long. Lately, whenever I add a profile, almost immediately, they are removed, and I see this pop-up message stating that Instagram are limiting for our protection. I am getting really frustrated because this is an ongoing issue. Can someone please help me with this, as it really won't be worth continuing with if I can't continue to add profiles. Thank you.",1
App experience is overall okay. For instance if you watch a reel and move to next one you will still the previous reels audio even when you go to messaging that happens for some reason and it sucks and ruins the entire experience while using the app. Fix it!,1
"Annoyed with random suggested accounts showing right next to my +Story bubble on the main page. I like my account dead the way it is, i dont wanna be suggested to add anyone, i dont care about discovering people suggestions. I just wanna upload my photography, jump into the group chat with my bois and post a story with a song that matches. Thats it. Please make it a Easy option to turn off and or remove.",1
"Sometimes, Instagram sucks in my phone. I don't know why my phone's volume gets decreased while watching insta, this happens every time. Insta was better before 5 years, but now it doesn't seem to safe for teens and adults. I think that meta has innovated the settings in Instagram, it has changed a lot.",1
"I have been using this since 6 years now, it is really different from other social media apps. The best updates come from time to time, they are very good. The update will come to the social media app after that. I use a business Instagram account. It is much better than the other personal account to do my work. I would like to use this more. Thank you !",1
"it's alright. but a pain to make multiple accounts. i like this accounts centre so i can link them but can't make a lot of accounts in one center. reels are ok. wish i could pause instead of muting when i tap, and stops me from commenting once in a while so i have to delete ans redownlaod the whole app.",1
Too buggy - Progress bar disappears randomly. Can't forward or rewind. - Recommended reels repeated after a few days. Including videos I had watched and sometimes even interacted with. - Some reels become pixelated despite the content being PG and unblocked.,1
"For the most part, Instagram has been great, but some of the changes lately has made it really hard to enjoy certain aspects. Like the fact that you can only see the top or the most recent comments or posts for hashtags. The whole point of hashtags is to be able to see ALL the posts associated with it. It has been very frustrating to not be able to all of them.",1
"Instagram is a great social media app. Especially if you want to talk to friend and/or family. Instagram also has a lot of bugs and glitches. For me I have a bug that I am not able to see the Instagram notes on my main account, I can only see the notes on my second account.",1
"I give 3 stars because We can't pin messages in a Direct. When we search for some messages, it shows the messages for a limit(you can't see all of your older and newer messages in a Direct as telegram) This is Instagram's worst problem Please fix it as soon as possible. Thank you",1
"I love Insta but not the auto scrolling. Why is this not an optional feature? Clearly from googling how to turn off auto scrolling,I am not the only person who hates it. It seems counterproductive to allow no flexibility with this. I admit using instagram is like Alice going down the rabbit hole but please provide some flexibility so we can at least imagine we are making our own choices!",1
"I actually really like this app, and it's the main social media app I use. Unfortunately, there is a lot more gore content flooding the app. I don't want/need to see this content and don't intentionally try to seek out this content. I really don't know how this started, whether I liked the wrong post or if I followed the wrong account. If I was looking for gore content, I'd download X instead.",1
"When uploading reels the ""add topic"" option doesn't function well. It always takes for ever to load the topics and lately it just doesn't load them at all. At most I get just the fashion topics to load, but nothing else anymore. This needs fixing.",1
"Can others' notes on reels be removed? I've toggled the settings already, and disabled ""Allow notes on posts and reels"". But the notes still appear on my reels regardless. Can this be fixed? Because the content I want to watch on reels isn't my usual content, but reels which have notes added by others. Thank you",1
It's need more editing options after posting some photos. if any one don't like pattern of his posting photos so that he can rearrange the order or pattern of photos without deleting the post. So i hope to consider this in you new updates,1
"It runs great on iPhone but for whatever reason, when I try to post thing from my Google Pixel8 phone, it's a hit or miss if it'll actually work. It's guaranteed not to work if I saved it to drafts and try to post it afterwards. I don't know if it's just my phone or if Instagram isn't as user friendly across all phones sort of ordeal.",1
"I am so sick of Instagram. When I first downloaded it 4 Anda half years ago it was an amazing app, simple to use, people actually saw your posts. I don't know what's happened in the last 12 to 18 months BUT it's RUINING my experience with the app so much. The worst thing is the updates SO MANY UPDATES and if I don't update them the app doesn't work. When I 1st got Instagram, I might have updated once a year now it's once or twice a week. Stop messing with what was a good app.",1
Songs and music disappears from stories often....and this has been a problem for a long time..why r u not fixing it...add the edit music option also so that one can apply another music when it becomes disappear. I'm very disappointed with this.....,1
Usually i never face any problems using the app but recently this year I've noticed how when I go watch Instagram reels sometimes the app just freezes and I can't do anything but get out of the app and start all over again so now I can't even find the reel I was watching last time.,1
"Personally, I think this app is good for connecting with people. It is also great for posting pictures or even videos. However their rules and community guidelines are getting out of hand to the point where you cannot post certain comments or pics, and yet I always see videos of explicit or graphic content that don't seem to be addressed at all. Also, they have far too many fake profiles,which I think is a joke, seeing as how that in itself is a violation. That's why I'm giving it 3 out of 5 ☆s.",1
"In the last few weeks, in my archive, the stories that once where there keep on becoming a blank image with the title of 'unavailable' despite always having WiFi connection or mobile data connection. Can you please solve this bug on your up.",1
"I've used Instagram for a long time but stopped for a while, and I've recently decided to start using it again. Something I enjoyed doing was going to hashtags and finding small fan accounts of things I enjoy. But all that appears are ""top posts"" and ""recent top post"" literally the same post are on both and it's annoying. I want actual recent post back. Please bring it back. Explore doesn't always show recent post, it only does ""top posts/recent top post"".",1
"After my February 2024 insta update, If i want to rewatch a certain part of the video i am not able to drag the video ahead. It just messes up the video and things get stuck. I have to keep watching the whole video again n again",1
"Some things on Instagram are okay. Most things on Instagram are absolute toxic piles of garbage! Take the reels for instance... If you scroll through enough of them, you will find a plethora of women promoting some type of pornography. And somehow those posts are okay, but things that depict even a small amount of violence, or other kind of content that isn't nudity, are usually taken down. Instagram approves of pedophilia and scams btw.",1
"My notification panel always shows the red dot, meaning that I haven't opened/viewed it. In reality, I have,and not once. It just doesn't go away. Get rid if those bugs jfc. It's not that hard!",1
So this morning I posted on my story a picture of a skull with scary music in the background (It's not a real skull) and for some reason the video wouldn't play. I then tried uploading it into a reel and it still wouldn't work and all my other stuff is working just fine! It's also posted on my Facebook and it's working fine. What is going on!,1
"I don't know how to feel about this app anymore. I like it because I can share what I'm doing with friends and family, but ever since I added 2 different accounts (one for a school club, one for training horses) I'm randomly logged out of one and then it says account not found or password incorrect or something else stupid",1
When I upload my videos their quality just gets very bad after being uploaded. When I use insta on chrome I see my videos in best quality while in app they seem to be of very poor quality. Do something which will make the app play video in the way insta web plays so that they can be viewed in good quality.,1
"I like the app as a way of communicating with friends and making new ones. However when I watch live streams, whatever tech is involved in the video or audio, the pitch of volume goes from normal to super low. Could that be fixed please?",1
"I think this app is overall very good, but the algorithm is constantly changing, which makes it harder to know what appeals to my fanbase. Another problem I have with this app is that I still have no access to the Broadcast Channel tool despite really needing it. Please fix this soon.",1
"The app is amazing overall. But more the years goes by, more it seems to get worse?? Or is it just me? The reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because of the bugs I have encountered. (The most annoying one is NOT being able to add music to carousel posts. It only appears on the rest of my accs 🙄)",1
"Ok I love this app but I hate how I keep getting hacked on it like I have already had to make multiple accounts for that very reason and sometimes I just can't log into my account and when I press ""forgot password?"" It glitches out every time and doesn't let me even try to get in even when I know I'm using the right password and like I was having a good time on this app when it says that some random person logged into my account and now I had to make another one because I can't get back in.",1
You can't skip around in a longer reel using the seek bar at the bottom the video and the app freeze for a bit and the bar disappears when it resumes working the seek bar disappears for some reason. Had been broken for about 4 days now at least.,1
"For some reason , on my phone I cannot like posts and I have no clue why. I made sure that I didnt have any account restrictiins and I have no clue who to contact to fix the issue. The ads are annoying and the technology used has made multiple mistakes, which it has removed. Please fix this problem and I will change my review",1
"I have a little problem, is, when I turn on the dark Mode, It goes to dark mode, but it doesn't have the deep black that it should have, but rather an opaque black almost navy blue, something that I really don't like, since I like the deep black that the dark mode has...",1
The app is good bt my friend CHANCHAL AGRAWAL came up with a situation on Instagram. She says there must be an option to post full length photos too. As she is having problem in using another app to square the image and then post on Instagram. Please bring the same feature in next update.,1
Love the reels addition BUT can you bring back zoom when doing videos in a set of 10 on a post. Can't zoom or adjust them at all anymore. Please fix. And posts that were previously archived aren't showing up,1
"As a photographer, Instagram's default square format is disappointing. Sure you can post in landscape, but it's just another step. I also do not like the fact that if I select images first, I can only post a Story or Reel.",1
"Instagram was great until 2022... It glitches out for everything and it doesn't matter if I restart my phone, Uninstaller then reinstall... I just get random error messages. I don't even get to create LIVE stories because of that",1
"it used to work pretty well, but for a few weeks now it's been very challenging to load things? most posts, stories, and messages take quite a while to load and often don't at all. i don't have this issue with any other webpage or app so i doubt my own Internet connection is the issue",1
"I use Instagram only because my FB was hacked and I was forced to. Instagram doesn't have any interesting articles, you can't find job or whatever you can not even send the CV. It's majorly bad in comperence with FB🥲 both are Meta Ads, but this one is worse.",1
"I'm just here to say....its getting worse.....I loved the dark mode feature...but recently it hasn't been working well...When I open the instagram app,dark mode doesn't work propely.It seems to me tht the interface is stuck between light nd dark mode.I will appreciate it if u fix this bug",1
"The number of times i've had to uninstall and reinstall Instagram because ""couldn't refresh feed"" since the beginning of 2024 is shocking... what has happened?? All the changes made to this app have caused so many issues, and it's the only social I use 🤦🏼‍♀️ fix it!!",1
"I enjoy this app, but it's been really buggy since the last update. If I leave the app and try to come back the screen freezes so I have to swipe out of it and go back in. Can't pause or rewind reels. It keeps having connecting issues when all my other apps work. Please fix these issues Instagram",1
"It would be 4 or 5, but my notifs have been limited to 2 notifications and an entire wall of dozens of ""suggested for you"" accounts, even after I turned off ""suggested"" in settings it's still doing it. I can't engage if my notifs aren't coming up. Fix it.",1
Finally managed to post something after months. Not sure why it allows you to adjust photos when posting multiple photos if it's not going to save and post it as you've adjusted them.,1
"I've been on IG for around 5 years now. It is fun, and it's frustrating at times with the algorithms. It was much easier to connect with the same like people back then than it is now. I believe you have to put in a ton of time, kinda like a second job kinda time, which I just don't have, and if I did have more time I'm not so sure that I would still put that kinda effort in. There is a lot of life to live, and it's better for me to live it as freely as possible. SM is not as social anymore.",1
This application is very good especially for technical and scientific information again we can take much better advantage,1

"Apps good, can be a little glitchy sometimes",1
"It's nice but it is very biased on who it gives the blue ticks to, doesn't really do anything about the hackers, there should be an option to replace any pictures uploaded previously which isn't looking nice anymore. Doesn't give the real content creaters to a ground to express",1
"Instagram is being so idiot 🙄 It just removed my comment saying ""it looks like you tried to get likes, follows or views in a misleading way"" and I just explained a movie in a reel of the movie...",1
This app nice,1
Couldn't update to latest version. Kindly help me to install the lastest version,1
I thought the camera was just baggy because i lost all my ig filters. I reinstalled it and still they're all gone. What should I do with this stupid things?,1

"Instagram has been coming down with alot of bug recently and it's very annoying. Alot of people are complaining about it but nothing is being down. All my saved filters for my stories got unsaved today morning when I went on the app and it does not all me to search for filters and when I added some filters from other people's stories, 1 hour later it all got unsaved again. Please sort out this problem immediately because it is very frustrating",1

"A good entertainment, here you get all the news from the country and the world, because instead of being Instagram, it has become a news channel, although now it hangs more than before, perhaps this happened due to frequent feature changes.",1

"After the new update, if you have to add another photo after uploading the first photo in a story, when you go to 'stickers' and choose the 'gallery/photo option, you can't CHOOSE a particular photo from different folders !! A random folder opens and you get only LIMITED photo options to upload! Anybody else with the same problem? This is so annoying!",1

"I've been using this app for a few years and I enjoy it but over the past few months I've found some really annoying glitches. My main issues are that sometimes I'll try to add some recently posted stories to a highlight and they won't show up in the select menu. Also, the images for my post drafts delete after around 12-18 hours, the caption will be intact but I won't be able to post it since the pictures/videos are gone. Despite that, I still enjoy the app and Ive found some nice communities.",2
"All of a sudden, the numbers always added to upper corner of each post will not disappear. Usually could tap and wait & it would disappear so could take screen shot if wanted to add to an album, with out the number being in the face or other places when the photo looks so much better without the #'s planted on. Ok to be there as they do make sense of things but much better when we could delete for screen copy.. WHY won't they erase now??? Tks.",2
"Its like the only app I use these days. But I do have some problems with it. First off, I get really annoyed at the fact that I can't get notifications sometimes. Idk if it's just my phone or if it's the app itself but it's annoying. Another, I hate that all videos (unless as a slide thing) are reels. I just want to unmute the video but it takes me to reels. It is just aggravating. Other then that I don't have any more problems with this. I just wish these would be fixed at some point.",2
"As other people have been explaining, I have also been experiencing the negative aspects of this app. I cannot post any pictures from my camera roll, period. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, given permission, cleared cache, you name it, and I STILL cannot post pictures. I've deleted the app until this is fixed. I've been having this issue on Threads as well. Instagram needs to fix this issue for users ASAP. The app was updated and this issue has been resolved. Thank you!",2
"it's a great overall app! It's just like tiktok, Facebook, and Twitter! You can call, text, post videos or pictures, it's cool! But I do have one problem with it though, that's why I had rated it a 4. I tried to open Instagram and for some reason it just doesn't wanna open the app. Oh well, im just gonna leave it until it does work. Overall it's a great and cool app!",2
"It's ok. Too many bugs with messaging. Every month there is something new that's not working. When you try to watch reels, there is an auto reminder to continue swiping up to continue watching other videos but it's so freaking annoying! It just makes the video you are trying to watch bounce a bunch of times and it's obnoxious af. I like the app for what I'm using it for, but for entertainment... it's annoying",2
"Good but not always functional. I have multiple accounts, but I can only schedule posts on one. Sometimes there are glitches with scheduled reels. Sometimes the audio reverts to a different time frame than I set it for when I post reels. Some audios do not work on my accounts, which makes it harder to find the perfect trending audios for my reels. It says ""reels using an audio track for the first time may take a while to show here."" Please help!",2
"Overall a great app. I have some issues though. I've used the app since before reels were a thing. My old video posts no longer work after reels were added. Another issue is when I want to remove audio from a reel, it says the audio is removed and when I listen in the draft there is no audio, but when it uploads the original audio is back. Last issue is even with permissions off, posts will save a copy to camera roll.",2
"Came to see if I was the only one having issues logging in. Turns out I'm not! I was trying to switch from one account to another but I just get a blank screen whenever I try to open the app. Can't log in at all anymore! Edit: I posted this review ages ago, but most bug fixes have improved the app overall. Would love to be able to pause reels.",2
I love this app. Being disabled it connects me to the outside world and I've made real friends on here. I don't what I'd do without it. I'm only giving it a 4☆ because out of nowhere the ability to comment on stories goes away. I u install and reinstall. Doesn't fix it. Look for updates there's none. turn the device on and off doesn't do anything. But then for no reason the ability comes back and acts normal again. It's so weird.,2
"PLS FIX STORY FEATURE. i wanna make instagram stories, but every time i try to put a sticker or text at the bottom of the screen, it automatically deletes bc of the button. It's like a black hole that can't have anything near it or it will delete. please fix this. it's incredibly inconvenient. the story feature aside, this app is very entertaining , 4 stars",2
"Instagram has made big improvements since my last post here. It runs more smoothly. I hold out on the 5th star because the special effects on the reels sometimes cause glitches. I notice when I do not use IG's reel effects, my reels run much smoother. Great upgrades though. They've also added some great features that make growing your audience and engaging with other people more efficient.",2
"Hello and have a good time I am a blind user who uses Instagram. I had a request from you regarding sending a story. Unfortunately, writing captions for Instagram stories is not accessible for the blind. When we want to write a caption for a story, we must adjust the text so that it does not fall on a certain part of the video or photo that we post and does not have a bad effect. Programs such as WhatsApp and Telegram have the ability to easily write a caption for the story and there is no probl",2
"I've truly never had a problem with Instagram, I've been using it for several years now. Never had issues outside of photo quality, hackers, and phone calls, I like how Instagram has improved over the years. I only wish for them to fix the photo quality. It tends to pixelate or get blurry in general, additionally; I wish for the phone call quality to be better. Sometimes, it's very hard to hear my friends. Or anyone I am directly talking to at that moment, all in all, Instagram is pretty good.",2
"Worked very well for me overall. The reason I'm leaving 4 stars is because I did encounter some bugs and glitches. The most annoying was whenever I tried to join a call, it would go to ringing, and then just say ""call ended"" even though that wasn't the case. Would greatly appreciate if developers could fix this issue, as I have had to re-install the app multiple times due to said issue.",2
"Instagram is a great social media platform, getting better with each update. I mostly like the new download option,that has made a lot of things easy. But one thing I think they should add is a way to be able to restrict certain followers from viewing your post -and not just your story- without having to block them. Also there should be a way to delete certain messages without having to delete the whole conversation or unsend it. This would be a great add on. Thank you. Keep up the good work.",2
"I like Instagram, for me it's serving the purpose of using it. It has influenced my artistic career positively. Building bridges, and breaking boundaries. Connecting me to people, interesting and great people. The most important thing is that it gets better by the day. Kudos to the creative, innovative, and intelligent team that's making this possible. Keep blazing the trail!",2
I've been using instagram since last year and the features are just great i like the way that you can highlight your stories and etc. i also like the way that you can add music to your posts to add a little more detail . But the only problem is if you log in your account in multiple devices it gives you like an error that you can't log in in other more devices. But overall still my favorite social media app in communicating with friends and family.,2
"Two things make me sad and frustrated about Instagram on my phone, both related to the feed refreshing automatically. I open the app, glimpse a post I am interested in at the top of the feed, and a second later...it's gone. Thanks automatic refresher (that's sarcasm). I'm watching a reel in the feed, my screen turns off, I turn it on again, and WHOOSH there goes the reel I was watching. Thanks, automatic refresher (that's sarcasm again). Please, make the madness stop.",2
"This is not an early stage app. After many years it is missing basic functionalities: copy text from a post, open link included in a post, download images and videos, go back to the previous page (post) that disappeared while auto-refresh. We have to use 3rd party patches to enable these features. Aren't you ashamed? We for people or people for us?",2
"Dear Instagram, I love you app so much because I can post stuff on story and send random reels to my friends, I wanted to inform you that recently whenever I try to skip certain reels video, I can't skip it, instead the reel freezes, so everytime I wanna skip a reel and save some time, I can't do it, please fix this problem. I love Instagram, even if something as little as the reel freezing is enough to make me not satisfied to use Instagram, so please fix it. Sincerely, your favourite user.",2
"Few suggestions for functionality that could improve the app. Introduce the concept of close friends for each post (or each posted pic among a series). So that people who want to post pictures for a limited audience within their account might be able to do so. When people accept the friend request, they should be able to control if the user can be added to close friends list or not. Suggestions for hashtags to be used would be a plus (usage of generative ai). Square frame editor",2
"Instagram experience for me is what used to be not a big fan of, recently changed ,as I realized how many awesome photo filters there is on here! Wow amazing filters for everyday photos you can edit, save, delete, whatever . Not to mention it's a very good way,as is Facebook, to connect to basically anyone in a convenient quick fashion.",2
"I am using this app from 1 years and I really found it to awesome. But there are some issues which I have observed in this app is that whenever I use dark mode, the app interface sometimes glitches to light theme. Also we can't clear chats permanently. Moreover, whenever I scroll reels, every time useless, sensitive and sexual content appears even after I block those. I would like to say that instagram company should work to improve its system and stop showing inappropriate contents to people!",2
Instagram is great though a tiny bit glitchy I'd give it 4 and a half but overall it's great there is a bug that I was trying to title my post and it was just glitching and I had to start my phone again because it would not let me type and I needed to leave because I was just finishing my post then leaving to go shopping so that held me back a bit it's good but if you try to fix the glitchingness I would rate it 5 stars thank you for reading,2
"Its a good app to follow celebrities, share pictures etc. The only thing I dont like is the new post notifications. the new post replaces the old one. And if I miss the previous post notification, there is no way to find out who was it from since its been replaced by the new one. There should be a notification panel or tab inside the app. Please make each notifications separate. Edit: much better now, the notifications has been updated.",2
Everything is real good on insta but recently I noticed that people are allowed to take screenshot of pictures we share for view once or which has time limits. What's the point of time limit or view once if that person is getting to have screenshot? I'm sharing a photo but I don't want the other person to have it in their phone and so I choose view once option but what's the point if the other person is able to save it in their phone though screenshots. Please fix it or update it 🙏🏻,2
Too many bugs. From 15th of March something is wrong with playing longer vedios. I am unable to watch it in landscape mode and even there is no play & pause button . How to contact these ppl for help. I have uninstalled this app so many times in the last few days. This is happening only in my account and I tried Logging in through other android phones still the same problem. Fix this glitch at the earliest. I mailed the support team also still no response.,2
"I'm kinda new to Instagram. So, I'm just learning how to create reels, polls, content and the RULES! I receive pop-ups telling me I've been restricted...often! I have 2 choices to choose from (1) OK or ""let us know if you think we're wrong!"" Normally, I hit ""ok"" and back to normal within a few hours! Hit the other one and I couldn't ""like, follow, comment"" for a week week or maybe it was bc I uninstalled and reinstalled? Either way they never told me why or how long! But recommend. I love app!",2
"Hello Instagram team! I just wanted to take a moment to express my appreciation for the amazing platform you've created. The recent updates have really enhanced my experience, especially [mention specific feature or improvement]. Keep up the fantastic work, and thank you for making Instagram such a wonderful place to connect and share!😊",2
Yeah it's good but many times it has many bugs and lags I don't who and all are having this problem I had this problem !!! I'm using insta for literally 3 years and had this issues not everytime but still it's a bad experience with insta !!!! And an very irritating bug is acct is not getting updated my acct is still in the old version even if I update insta my acct won't be getting the new updated features this more irritating than anything in insta if they change this it will be great !!!,2
"I just have one thing to suggest.... It would have been better if there be an option where we could change or add or edit the soundtrack once we upload the photos. For example, changing the soundtrack of the previously uploaded photos, especially the songs which are no longer available now with some other songs",2
"A built-in bulk unfollow option would be fantastic! ------------- I love Instagram for connecting with friends and seeing cool content, but managing follows is a hassle. A built-in bulk unfollow option would be fantastic! It's tough to weed out spam and inactive accounts one by one. This would make cleaning up my following list so much easier and faster.",2
"Hi, this app is good but not bad there seems to be glitches which I thought were my network issues like can't unsend messages or like see someone's story it just loads and continues loading, the app does have few minor issues but it's a great app. (Edit): it works just fine now tough from time to time it glitches like my dms not working, but most issues are fixed <3 Changing review from 3⚝ to 4 ⚝ ✨💖",2
"I've been an instagram user since 2014 and I've never felt compelled to write a review until now. I've been mostly happy with the app until the most recent update. It has ostracized photographers and emphasized ""tiktok"" like content instead. Stop forcing reels and shopping down my throat. Stop deleting my drafts, and give me back the option to save one for later. Stop showing me ads every 3rd post. Show me the posts of the accounts that I follow, because that's WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR.",2
"great but battery drain in the background is awful. I hsve to let it work in the background cause I got so many groupchats and text chains on here, I turn off all other notifications yet it's one of highest power drawing apps in the background on my phone.",2
"So far...I've had no issues with Instagram except a small glitch. When I tried to comment on a post once I wasn't able to...then a small notice popped up saying ""I'd be allowed to comment on reels after 2 day. This happened twice but hasn't occurred recently. But really this app is exceptional and very easy to use...I love it!!!",2
"I have a genuine request to add into the app and that's a scroll bar for the ""Saved"" Posts columns. I've saved a lot of posts over a long period of time and scrolling endlessly for them isn't convenient. A scroll bar would save alot of time.",2
"Hii..I'm from India. It is really a fantastic 💞 and a very useful app. Only one thing that I don't like in this app is after uploading a post, we are not capable to delete or change the song that we have uploaded with that post. So I would like to say that please add this feature, so that we can change or remove the song even after uploaded. Thank You 😇",2
"I love Instagram and run my business on the platform but there are always glitches and there is so much work into getting the algorithm to push your content, it can be exhausting. Like I said, I do LOVE Instagram but when you are trying to build and scale a business it can take a lot of work to get there if you don't know what you are doing. I am thankful for the platform as most of my clients have come from it. Hope they fix the glitches!",2
It's an Amazing experience with using this App!! But the only Problem is when I want apply filters for my story I have only limited choice of saved and default filters. So I wish that there is a option for explore more filters directly on pictures from album. I hope that you will understand my problem...And think about this..!,2
"I love Instagram but I can't ever get to the bottom of my saved posts without the app force quitting. If it could just have a date search that'd be really great. ALSO, would love to be able to reorganize the order of pictures that have already been posted with the edit option.",2
"The App is great for networking! I wish it's was more curated to my selected insteres! I would like to increase my following. I wish the Ads paid campaign targeted my entire account content, and not just the selected post. I would like the App to provide me with incentives based on the number of views and engagements I create. For safety reasons, I would like the Instagram App to be equip with a FALL DETECTION SENSORS and linked to the emergency land line(Not just the shake phone to report)",2
"Sometimes when editing reels, it becomes needlessly difficult. You add text, go to change it and its disappeared in the editing screen but it still shows up. Its almost like not everything loads when editing. Other than that, it's great!",2
"It's good app but recently I experienced that it's lagging very much or something,sometimes it's shows confirm request and when then I open request it shows following. And story quilty or pic quality is slowly blurring I can't even see pictures in insta but it's good to chat with friends............and please add clear chat or something option that's it thanks",2
"I been using IG since it hit. Experience is mostly what you imagine & like seeing. Facebook always makes me feel depressed, but I laugh & catch up on sports here. Met & chat with some known figures, got replies, or 100 likes on funny comment. ; The Main feature i miss was the IGTV, rotate widescreen view. I installed an old version & it worked but was missing newer features. A bit more traffic to scroll by your new post would be a nice touch i'd suggest. Tik Tok does that well & shows result.",2
"So far I have had this app for like 2 years and I haven't really had any issues, I had an issue in the passed where I would turn on the dark theme and when I'm in a call or texting someone I go on the app and it is all black and white and looks all messed up but it has not happened for a while, the app is really good and is very useful! The button to hide a comment should also be moved I think. It's to close to the reply button",2
"i enjoy posting on Instagram a lot! especially when I can use the music feature. however, i wish that there is an option to add music to something I've already posted, whether it's a post with multiple photos or a single photo post. i think that this feature would be something a lot of other people would enjoy using as well. Update: i love the new pong game that got added! it's so fun typing an emoji and then just playing pong when waiting for someone to respond",2
"I am having a similar issue as I am watching reels that the progress load bar disappears, which makes it no longer for me to skip forward, I have to go outside the video and come back in. The reels that would replay by themselves will skip to the next video without me doing it.",2
"App works good but when you add more than one photo in a post and apply some edits, it uses more memory and some times app gets stuck.. Also there is no option remove of edit music once any post is uploaded, it will be very helpful if that option should be there. I hope Instagram will add it in upcoming updates.",2
"For being the picture app, it sure does glitch a lot with Hella bugs and low quality videos and pictures whenever I send some to my friends. Messages get deleted so can't even retrieve memories/convos. When you try posting more than 2 items, the music glitches where you can't select the 15 second clip you want, it's stuck. A lot of issues and they deleted the funny GIFS. Other than that great app for friends and entertainment.",2
"It is a really good app but i,m facing some issues, Instagram is working a bit too slow i mean Today i almost lost my account its not easy to lose one i got many things in that. I wasn't able to login back as Instagram was not sending the Verification code. My network everything was working perfectly but Instagram was the only with Network problem I would suggest to please look into this issue and try solving it Thank you!",2
I got to get the hang on posting photos to my p'file and they have a variety of clips and subjects to amplify ones knowledge.. Now they have the option of editing other peoples reels with our own addition to them..I wish they had video clip p'file. I am better at posting and now clips are longer too. Even longer than 1 minute and remixing g if reels!,2
"Four stars because the time on it I havent balance out yet. Im spending more time dreaming than doing. I mean I like it, but its too addictive lol. So fewer stars. Thanks for the opportunity to voice my feedback. mar 24 update: thanks for asking me if I wanted you to back off on the promotion of your other channels. asking again in 3 months suggests a degree of loyalty but still not five stars because I don't know how to edit videos yet",2
"Don't know why I haven't been able to play reels on my Android. The Icon has disappeared and even after reinstalling it comes once but it doesn't play reels at all, a blank screen appears. And the icon vanishes when app is closed and opened again. Pathetic. fixed now hence editing and updated rating.",2
"Very good app, but... I save a lot of posts I see on Instagram, but the way I have to access them is not so easy, I have to click on my profile picture, click on hamburger menu and then click on saved to see the posts in a grade. I'd like it to be easier, like when I'm surfing on insta in my computer, I can access the saved posts only by entering my profile. Please, if you give us a better shortcut to our saved items it would be nice to me.",2
"Sometimes, messages show up in my notifications but not in the app when I check. I also found that sometimes voice messages don't send and that past messages don't load after a bit. However, it's a really great app and is overall really fun despite the occasional glitch.",2
"Instagram is an incredible platform that seamlessly blends creativity, community, and connection. Its intuitive interface makes sharing moments with friends and discovering new passions effortless. With a diverse range of features like Stories, Reels, and IGTV, Instagram offers endless opportunities for self-expression and exploration.",2
"Since I downloaded this app I'm having problems. Stops refreshing or working every once in a while. In addition to this keeps asking me to add my birthday date, but if I don't want to do it I can't access to my account. My solution is keep uninstalling and downloading again and again, every time it doesn't work. Such a poor app.",2
"Uploading to instagram, the app just decides to not upload things until maybe your 30th try, it's a bit annoying at this stage, and I've spoken to others who agree. Please resolve this. Otherwise, great app. Great fun to use, and an excellent way to connect with people in similar social circles.",2
"I have my instagram updated and everything but I can't find the option of add song on the notes its only says one thing and that is ""The song you choose might not be available in all the countries"". Either ways it is really good app.",2
It's good but I STILL can't seen to put music on or search any kind of music other than random music they have there for you. I've already made reports and complaints about it for over a year and nothing has STILL been resolved for me!!!,2
"lowkey don't know how instagram functions, mainly because i am a content creator (sorta HAHA) on tiktok, and it has a distinct layout to it. BUT it's still a really good app!! (oh and sometimes i encounter some glitches when posting, but they only happen for a split second)",2
"According to my overall experience I had a great experience but they may work on the chatting quality voice messages limits, accessibility in sharing all formats of files and they may create an ease in forwarding messages.. I would appreciate the facility of editing the sent messages.. Overall the experience is great 👍🏻",2
"There are too many bugs, like the audio bug, u cannot put audio on note because song isnt in your contry, to delaying messages and replies on stories and notes, this NEEDS to be fixed immidiately, otherwise instagramers will face problems accordingly! But the app is perfect, so plz fix these issues",2
"Always has some interesting new features, but there are some bugs(like, if your phone is on dark mode, you will have a hard time using instagram on light mode, it should always follow the system mode) which hopefully would be fixed at some point.",2
It's too good for connecting the peoples shares the biography and loved it... But this recently updated version of instgram is lot's of bugs in reels... Moreover the notificationz are damn slow to receive and not indicate... Fix the lot's of bugs and refix the problem..,2
"The app is good for socialising and interacting with people but I got a problem recently. The problem is that that when I am trying to save bio it creates some issue which says 'something went wrong, try again' but when I am again trying it still not working. I have reported it but instagram is not responding. It will help alot if Instagram fixes this problem. Thank you",2
"1) IG was designed for a purpose and was good at it, then someone decided it had to compete with tiktok, so the format changed to emphasis on videos. Rumor (WSJ) has it that IG is going to start shaddow banning political and social content accounts. So, you decide if it's worth it anymore.... 2) It would be nice if the application let you, when posting multiple photos, scale each photo, and not just the one. This results in images being randomly cropped to fit.",2
"Overall this app is good. But I have one suggestion: in the profile page of chats, can u add functionality for continous reels to be shown as per the chat history, Just like normally it shows for profile. As its hectic and cumbersome to watch one reels at a time, and go back again in the chat history.",2
The app is amazing. Improvements that can be done are to add the ability to be able to change the music on a post even after the post is posted and the ability to add or remove pictures from a post even after it's posted since I feel the need of removing or adding new pictures to a post.,2
Please make options to choose the part of a video to be upload on the reel or story (like whatsapp story video options). So we don't have to edit and cut the videos down to 1 minute. The app is great. Still has rooms for improvement.,2
"Instagram is the best app for making short videos. I love Instagram. But there is a problem. After creating the video, when I play the video, the quality of the video becomes bad. Very bad quality.",2
"Whenever I join a call Instagram automatically shutdown the app and take time to rejoin. I have been facing a lot of issues these days , i can't see the post someone has send me , or when I text them i can't see what I texted until I go back to the homepage , and this is very frequent. I would really appreciate if Instagram do something about it. Now I can't log in Instagram its like so irritating. Fix it soon",2
"Will not load my stories or posts for multiple days. Got a business account. Always in processing or posting mode but won't go through. Messaging still works, other people's posts/stories still load but who tf knows when or what others are unable to post vs what Instagram chooses to show me.. 🤦 Bottom line: jump back on email.",2
"I'm experiencing glitches on Instagram. Every time I try to refresh my reels, the button doesn't work. My workaround is to close the application in order to refresh the reels, or I have to scroll from the top to be able to refresh them.",2
"Below I'd mentioned my problem but insta has fixed it now! So I'm increasing the ratings given by me with 2 I have a complain of an issue! I just can't reply my friend's chat, when I hold on the message it shows three options, 1st is report, 2nd is copy text and 3rd is like... there is no reply option it is just frustrating and irritating, I sent feedback 3 times but still no change, DO SOMETHING OF THIS PROBLEM INSTAGRAM",2
"couldn't upload a pic and video on my day.... The pic and video keeps saying ""posting"" but actually doesn't do anything. When I close and re-open the app, the day keeps showing me an exclamation sign (!) on my day and the pic is still not posted !!!",2
"I don't know what happened but I can't add account ont the app, i uninstalled the app for like few mins but now when I want to log it again I can't whenever I open the app all that comes is black screen I can se notification bar and home tab bar too but the options for log or sign up doesn't come up I did uninstalled and installed again and again Even restarted the phone but nothing happens please see what's the problem and fix it as soon as you can",2
"I like the app. All its features are quite nice. The only thing I personally want is that the reels you post are separated from the photos. Now when you go to a profile you will see both photos and reels, but I think if they're separated would be more organized",2
"Hey I would like to say that this app works normally but suddenly out of nowhere it doesn't work and say things like ""couldn't refresh feed "" or "" no internet connection"" ( but still my internet keeps working in other apps ) and then when I try to re install the app the app says that ""Instagram couldn't be installed "" This has happened around 3 -4times",2
Most of the times when you upload a professional video on reels or stories the colors and contrast are altered and washed out... This is a big problem that persists for a long time. Please try to fix it,2
"This app is great and all but whenever I try to put a story using the music, it always says ""this music is currently unavailable"". If this is a problem of my phone, please let me know. And if its not, then please try to fix it. Thank you!",2
Amazing app but the only problem is that if I've logged in a different device with another acc. and I don't want anyone to access it without confirming by giving the password...they can...its troublesome as it may happen that I don't want a person to log in..they can change acc. in the dm corner.,2
"The app overall is pretty good, I like the pole feature. However sometimes it crashes and I wish you guys would not do the thing where you only let people follow so many people at a time. If you could please get rid of that, that would be great. There's no reason why we shouldn't be able to follow as many people as we like because it's only benefiting and helping them and the communities that were a part of.",2
It's an amazing app but it would be great if the live videos had a translation. The whole world is connect through this so the language is a problem for live videos. Hope you will introduce an update for it.,2
Fun app easy to use. Works best when you delete & reload about once a month. Update it has gotten better. But I wish you could delete post easier. I have a hard time getting mine the right size. So I will sometimes post and delete several times to get it legible. Please fix this Instagram.,2
In this new year I keep getting notifications every time I try to add friends to my following. The app acts as though adding friends is breaking the rules. Isn't that the point of using social media? I'm only adding at max 20 or less people daily. Why is that infringement. It's frustrating when you're goal is to build relationships in your industry,2
"An all the world favorite app. However, it can get even better if developers added the button to change to landscape/portrait view any time user requires to get the most of what they are watchin👍",2
"Glad to give an updated review. Man I love this app alot. The services that weren't available in my region that I complained about before are now available. Thanks meta. However I'd still love to see more services being available in my region like meta verification but I guess I'll wait. Solid app overall,best interface and the Instagram reels are so fun and interactive. I love it",2
"American-made (if that means anything at all to you) but it provides great entertainment to you if you let it. it is not the most server fail-safe or bug-proof app out there, but it definitely does the trick, imo. could be better could be worse",2
"I use this app a lot, and it is by far my favorite social media platform, but it gets frustrating knowing that all the latest features only apply to one account. I use more than one account, and the new features always go to my personal account and not my main. I would like if all accounts could have these features, and I would like to use those features on my main account. Please fix this issue.",2
"App has a few minor bugs like...my friend was not able read 3 of my messages out of 4 until I sent another message, other than that the overall experience is good and I have feature suggestion, you should be able to change ur msg double tap heart emoji color.",2
"Overall awesome. However, I experienced challenges tryinng to link my facebook page with the account. It's also a challenge navigating the many settings. Sone important aspects of user controls are hidden. The app could usee a better and friendly user interface",2
"It's really amazing app that helps to join 🙂 people across the world 😄. Time break feature is not good because it's only notifiy it's need to be change by disable access to use account to save time and reduce time wasting on it . Yes, 👍 we can say ☺️ help to find my old friends.",2
"The App is a good place to showcase you, your work, your interests. It's hard to get reach now ; likes have dropped dramatically and there are too many new features that don't really help users. It's still a good place to find inspirational images and people.",2
"I have installed this app a month ago. Indeed, It's a very good app and I really enjoyed it. But there are many network issues. The video stops after some seconds and there is no option to stop the video. Please fix this problem.",2
Need to check their algorithms as perfectly innocent posts keep getting tagged as spam. When using music with a single photo the music clip needs to be longer without having to add more photos.,2
I love it after a year of no social media after being stalked & scammed by someone who used a picture of a friend. I've read tutorials on Instagram to hopefully insure doesn't happen again. Thought I was smart but the bad guys are smarter. All things in moderation.,2
"usually it's awesome but currently I'm not able to access the layout option on my stories, as soon as i wanna change the layout and i touch the icon, the screen goes blank. and it's irritable. i hope you can fix it",2
"Is Fun,",2
The app is just great but I suggest to include a download function where I can download videos and watch later in my files,2

"Update 2/20: Did repeat troubleshooting on my Samsung S24+. When I uninstall and reinstall, the app works for that time in I'm initially in there after install. But when I go out of it (not logout) and try to go back to it, it crashes again like before. But that's actually progress. UPDATE 2/23: The latest update has fixed the crashing! Thank you all so much for your hard work!",2
"It's really not bad for me at all !! I feel that if whoever having problems with it ,it don't really have anything to do wit Instagram , it's a very useful and entertaining app !! I have no problems , only when I'm watching reels and they stop loading when I watching them for to long . But other than that I love it ! I can text , go live , post on my story and page , and it's a lot more !",2
"The audio on my reel is no longer available, Instagram should at least allow me to go back and edit so I can add ANY audio VS. having it silent 😔. More feedback Draft doesn't work, no matter how much your put Into it. It just force me to just upload as I go VS. keeping it saved (draft) for later. Please bring the ""fit to screen"" the zoom in option for reel. Uploaded a reel and once it was fully uploaded no matter how much I resized it, it still cropped and was not fit to screen",2
"I find it quite nice, but please not add more features, it'll become a too heavy app in my opinion. Right know it's balanced! But, if I want to add something to a story sticker (where everyone can share on the stickers topic), I get no option anymore to search for what I want to post by the devices albums. Please just make it so you have the option to access what you want to post via the albums. When you simply post a story you still have that option, just make it for adding to stickers to strs!",2
"I absolutely love Instagram! It's my go-to platform for connecting with friends, staying updated on trends, and exploring new content. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate, and the variety of features like Stories, Reels, and IGTV keeps things interesting. Plus, the algorithm seems to know exactly what I'm interested in, so my feed is always filled with relevant and engaging posts. Overall, Instagram gets a solid 5-star rating from me!",2
"Starting a few versions back, I'm not able to reproduce reels sent by Whatsapp or any other app. When I click on the link, Instagram opens up in the reels but in black screen and video is never reproduced. Please note that I'm able to open the link to post, this issue only happens with reels. UPDATE: A few weeks back the issue was solved.",2
"Hi, I'd like to appreciate the effort you have put in making such a nice app, meanwhile there is a bug that I want to report. I don't know if it only exists in the android version or not but when you close the application via the home or back buttons most of the times, last video that was being shown on the app keeps playing even though the app isn't running in the foreground anymore. Many of my friends have this problem too. I'd be glad if you can solve this issue in the future updates. Thanks.",2

"It is a very good app and its features are also very good . But for some family issues , I uninstalled the app and when I reinstalled it and tried to log in to my existing account , the loggin page showed a notification that something error happened. I tried many times after that by reinstalling it , but every time it showed the same. Are you aware of this ? If not then please do something that can solve this matter . Thank you 🙏🙇🏻‍♀️",2
"I really like instagram, it's really interesting, and addictive(in a good way)but for some reason i cannot put music on my notes, i can only put messages, i already updated my instagram and the music icon is still not popping up, i tired putting it in dark mode etc, and it still doesn't show up, please try and fix this, other than that. Instagram is great!",2
"It's one of best applications I have ever used. Its features are really outstanding and easy to upload the pictures. Furthermore, it doesn't have any adds like YouTube and other applications do. I prefer Instagram the best. I highly recommend this to those who are quite interested in photography and want post their long lasting memories. It must be rated with five stars 🌟, I think.",2
"EDIT: Issue was resolved. Thank you! I have been experiencing this error wherein I cannot upload photos saved in my SD card but the photos can be seen fine in other apps. I tried uninstalling then installing again but the problem persisted. Upon reviewing the reviews here, it seems to be a problem for android users lately. Please address this. Thank you",2
"Great app One plus point is that the comments option starts lagging whenever the app needs an update. I had experienced it, and this makes me anxious to try again and again for almost 10 times to check what was happened. Later, there was a message which say that search more or something related to this. Although I am not satisfied with this, as I am a anxious person, but the security centre of meta has ensured me that nothing is wrong with my ig account. You know I am confident about your app.",2
"Instagram is the best social media platform that provides more entertainment all over the world. Supporting and helping people like creators and bloggers. However, please add the pause option in Reels. When we are reading comments, the reel plays automatically many times. And it consumes more Internet. Please make an update on reels. We need pause and play option for reels immediately. Thank you... 😊",2
"Hii..I'm from India. It is really a fantastic💝 and a very useful app. Only one thing that I don't like in this app is after uploading a post, we are not capable to delete or change the song that we have uploaded with that post. So I would like to say that please add this feature, so that we can change or remove the song even after uploaded. Thank You 😘",2
"""Exceptional app! The user-friendly interface and seamless navigation make Instagram a standout platform. The constant updates bring exciting features and improvements, keeping the experience fresh. From stunning photo sharing to engaging stories, Instagram is a must-have for connecting with friends and exploring inspiring content. Kudos to the developers for delivering a top-notch social media experience!""",2
Great fun . New to this app but loving finding people who I actually am friends with in real life on here and other I'm familiar with and support online elsewhere too. Easy to learn the basics of how to use and even more fun getting to know how to tweak options on the app to my preferences and begin to gain some fun traction with cool people on here. Way more fun and more normal than tic tok Thanks you.,2
"The recomendations Instagram gives me based off of my personal intrests are great. The texting feature on the app is also really great, its easy and conveinient and even allows you to share content that you enjoy with content that others may enjoy. Moving on to the reels, the reels are great I like how you can give credit to people and or artists for sounds/songs. I also enjoy the comment section so that you can see what other people thought of the video and say what you though about It. *10/10*",2
Great app for connecting to the world. I love the diversity of what you can view and whom you can connect with. I would like to see more real followers...not bots..the algorhythms sometimes do not let me reach my full audience and I believe this can be improved to make Instagram even better to reach full potential and satisfy every user especially artists and businesses!,2
"Updated to 5 stars - this bug has been fixed! (Older issue below) Cannot access gallery/photos due to supposed SD card glitch on Android devices. App is unusable until this is fixed. Tried reinstall, clearing cache, updating permissions, restart, nothing has worked. I previously would have rated 5 stars, and will again once the app is usable again.",2
"Hey,please see this.. New update is not good like it covers vertical a strip which contains all home reel messages and all but it doesn't look good please change it to back updates where we look reels in full screen every things in full screen and the icon buttons are spread at full screen which does not affect the reels and home page please place the all icons like before please It's huge request.. one more thing after this update sometimes when we tap for commenting on any reel it doesn't work",2

"I love instagram it has a lot of creative options and guidelines on how to create content. However, my business page does not have all the music I want, even if I search it only has these unknown songs that don't give that kick to the work content I'd have created with the aim to go with the trends. Don't know if there is a reason for this and if it can be rectified.",2

"This app is very easy and fun to use.It has many new types of filters.I like that one ❤️. But sometimes it's going wrong. And I can't see my first message on chats. I think if there was a search option on Instagram chat then we can search our first massage, it would have been better for us users.Because it would be easier for us to see our first messages and we would be able to remember our funny and lovely moments. Otherwise it's not bad.👍🏻",2
"""Instagram has truly transformed my social media experience. The user-friendly interface, seamless navigation, and engaging features make it my go-to platform for sharing moments. The constant updates keep things fresh, and the community aspect adds a sense of connection. A solid app for capturing and sharing life's highlights.",2
"I'm always into reels so I think it's becoming more like tiktok but way beyond its standards when it comes to reels and using filters. I'm delighted to promote Instragram as one of the best social media platforms to connect with new people all around the world. It helps me alot while using this platform and if you're someone who haven't created an account, I suggest you better download this app and start to create one for yourself. You'll enjoy new features and it's beneficial to young people.",2
"It used to be very good. Then suddenly I couldn't view how many people have viewed my story anymore. Also all of the ""sex"" Bots are really annoying. And the scammers on there should be prosecuted way more then they are currently. Other than that it's a great way for me to share my photography work and find inspiration in other people's work. . If you could fix the black screen when I try to view my story views then I would give it a 4/5 Edit/ giving it a 5/5 because they updated it.",2
Everything is good.. I want to request a music player feature to listen the saved songs continuously and in loops... We get too much inspiration for making viral content while listening to those songs But currently we have to click the button everytime we want to play the song... And that disturb us a little bit...,2
"Earlier this app worked fine. But a long time ago, there was an Instagram update where you can add songs to Instagram stories. But no matter how much time passes on my phone, the update does not come. Another thing is that I have 11k followers but I don't have the ability to create a broadcast channel. It's something I really need because I'm running a fan page. There are no other problems. But these two updates are requested to be bought for redmi note 12",2
"Great app One plus point is that the comments option starts lagging whenever the app needs an update. I had experienced it, and this makes me anxious to try again and again for almost 10 times to check what was happened. Later, there was a message which say that search more or something related to this. Although I am not satisfied with this, as I am a anxious person, but the security centre of meta has ensured me that nothing is wrong with my ig account. You know I am confident about yo",2
"Very good, relaxing 😌 just make sure to push the algorithm to only positive things that make you happy and it can do that for you. Kinda addictive but educational if you have hobbies to grow in and need some small clips to pass the time on breaks!",2
Instagram has been a go to app for a lot of professionals and has turned youngsters into digital marketing professionals. Great app. I wish though the algorithm changes are spelled out to its users from time to time.,2
"I love Instagram and all but something that had caught my attention was the removal of the change emoji option. Most of my fellow colleagues were left both speechless and disappointed because of it, I'm just wondering is it s glitch or was there an actual remove of one of the most amazing options on Instagram. Lp.",2
"this is a very good app but there is a problem Sometime it show a reel so much that it gets a lot of likes, but sometimes I don't get even 1 like. Why does this happen Reels should also reach our followers And the good thing is that it has the best message feature.But anyone can easily hack the account which causes trouble to us. Instagram company is requested to do a little more work on its security so that we can feel safe.🙂🙂🙂",2
I feel it's a very good platform for the creators who want to grow .... personally I love it very much ..... I don't want to describe more about it as I suggest others to use it directly you will feel same as I'm feeling about Instagram..... but One thing I want to say that Instagram must provide more benefits to the beginners so they do no feel dishearted..... although my experience is good on this app,2
New to Instagram but I like it. Would like to see support for portrait and landscape images though instead of just square. Also I noticed that the app doesn't seem to support animated GIF images. Please improve! Support for vertical and landscape video is good.,2
"Instagram is an incredible platform that I absolutely love! It's a creative haven where I can express myself through photos and videos. The filters and editing tools make my posts look amazing. I enjoy connecting with friends, discovering new content, and getting inspired by the incredible community. The Stories feature is so much fun, and I love sharing snippets of my day with my followers. The Explore page always surprises me with interesting and relevant content. Overall, Instagram is my go-t",2
I love the app but sometimes I will experience some late of update like the note music update and so on. Also sometimes there will be an error where I can't click on feed. I hope this issue can be fixed. Also I recommend to add feature like video trimming or maybe music/adjust feature on story. Thanks^^,2
overall Good App. but sometimes they update it and some features are not like it. Recent update in chats someone send reels to me but I can't see the exact one it will go through last time what I see the reel he send to me. it will frustrated me. can you please change that settings. i post this above query in 21/02/2024...but now it's cleared thankx mark sir. for this I put one more star rating 😉.,2
Tots love the app my experience has been great watching it evolve . It is an absolute favorite of mine but don't get too addicted yes it's addictive but you can set a timer for how long you want to be on insta and when time is up it will pop up on screen no adverts and there's also parental options has really great features,2
"albeit there might be some issue on content recommendations being clearly randomized sometimes which means i had to cache reset every few weeks, i'd say instagram is literally one of the best social media out there, why? quite simple, my internet is absolutely horrenduous, a little ping spike and i'm done from almost any internet. But in instagram, even in the worst of rains, instagram somehow works fine as if i'm living in Japan. Truly an instagram moment.",2
New app update can't use photos or videos from my SD card. That is where all my videos are stored. Cannot make anymore Reels or stories. App is useless to me now. ****New update fixed my Instagram SD card access problem. It works great now. Thank you so very much. That was no fun not being able to use my photos and videos from my card. Thanks again! 👍😁❤️🧡💛💚🩵💙💜🤎,2
"The app needs an update. Videos from a carousel (multiple post- post) that I click on shows a black screen which causes me to swipe left then back to the video so it can play. Another issue I'm having is the slider at the bottom of videos. Anytime I try to fast forward or rewind a video using the slide bar at the bottom, it causes the video to freeze. I've already unistalled and reinstalled the app.",2
"I think instagram was developed smart based on real life, The more posts you see, the more you want to see, and you don't notice the passing of time. UI is very simple, minimal, and wonderful. 😍😍 All user from any age work well with it. Thanks 🙏",2
"My experience with Instagram has been mostly positive. I enjoy using the platform to connect with friends and family, as well as to discover new content and trends. I like being able to share photos and videos of my own life and see what others are posting as well. However, I do find that it can be a bit overwhelming at times with the constant stream of content and the pressure to always be posting. Overall, I think Instagram is a fun and engaging way to stay connected with others and share mome",2
"I really liked a small change in the latest update, that when I tap on Menu option now all my saved reels, Archive and My Activity is in same list as of others Settings. So a good touch, please don't change it",2
"As an avid user of social media, Instagram has been a staple in my digital life. Here's why I love it: 📸 **Visual Appeal**: Instagram's interface is clean and visually appealing. The emphasis on photos and videos makes scrolling through my feed a delight. 🌈 **Filters and Editing Tools**: The variety of filters and editing tools allow me to enhance my photos and unleash my creativity. From adjusting brightness to adding fun stickers, the possibilities are endl",2
"Personally, the best social media platform I've ever used. It made communicating with friends and family so much easier. And the reels, just wow, everything about this app is god tier. Thank you Instagram, or should I say, thank you meta, or even better, thank you Mark Zuckerberg and the team for making and standing by such a wonderful and powerful app, that has in many ways improved and made the lives of many better.",2
"I've always had a positive experience, either browsing or posting! And I have to say that I really tried to like Tiktok and Threads, but in the end, I did not. TicTok seems to be hypnoctic mindlessness, and Threads is just boring. Instagram has quality, depth, and timeliness. Also, I like how it evolves and grows with compassionate intelligence.",2
"Instagram sets the gold standard for social media platforms. Its intuitive interface, diverse features like Stories, Reels, and IGTV, along with constant updates, make it an indispensable tool for staying connected and creative. I really enjoyed it",2
I really like this app. I'm still learning how to use it but I think it's easier than tik tok. It has a lot of good info if u are looking to expand ur knowledge or w.e. u r looking to do. Also love that it presents a lot of diff opportunities. I prefer this app over most the other social media apps. It's hard for an app to keep my attention but I think I spend more time on this one than others.,2
You see new and updated information every day.It is worthy to view daily. I just love Instagram! Words really cannot express how I really feel!! I just love it...it is my awakening and my going to bed!!! Long ago I use to say!! Why do people go on Instagram for every day! I couldn't understand until I was so icked in like magnet..in a magnetic field! I love it!!!!,2
All good 1. but somtimes even we close app music and audio is running in background Update related 2.can you give button to translate captions of reels ...I would be helpful when someone watching other nations reels and there langauge are different you know as you given option to translate bio and comments 😀,2
"UPDATE: Since the below review insta developers fixed my issue super quickly, thanks! Follow button invisible - a bug? When I click 'follow' the button goes invisible instead of changing to 'following', so this may be an android bug? Also if I click follow to a private account, the button is again invisible and there is a blank space where the button should change to say 'requested'. I have experimented with tests to see if logging in and out or reinstalling might fix the issue, but no.",2

It was me yesterday night to add my friends in my close friends list. And I did not share my PW to anyone. I don't need or seek followers. Plz restore multiple close friends list. give option to save/restore close friend list. Allow users to ban countries or cities where his feed post / storyline / reel should not be visible. Plz show collaborators buttons in reel post as you showed in feed post for multiple accounts. add option to accept automatically Reel post in multiple accounts. Tnx,2
"Basically whenever I go to choose music for stories or notes it only suggests a few songs and when I search songs up it says nothing found even though I know I can choose those songs and I've tried everything, I've deleted and reinstalled, logged out and back in, and I switched from personal to business and then back to business in hopes it would fix it but nope it didn't fix the problem",2
"I love exploring this app, but there's a problem. I only tried to view a post, but then there was a message telling me to ""try again later"" and ""we restrict certain activity to 'protect' our community"". Can something please be done about this? Thank you. It would be highly appreciated and helpful. Belated edit: I think it's gone now! I dunno what was going on, but I think the problem has been solved.",2
I enjoy Instagram and love seeing photos from around the world. I do not use Instagram for finding friends - purely for showing beautiful photos of the world etc. I have enjoyed Instagram for years and continue do so. It's nice to have genuine Instagram friends too. I find so much photographic talent through this media outlet - it's just wonderful❤,2
"Terrible app but I'm addicted to it so I can't let go. Otherwise, too much adverts and I never see content from people that I follow. Just one suggested post after another. The explorer page shows same post's dated 2-3yrs ago.",2
have been using Instagram for a very long time when I use it more often it goes off and back to the home screen of my mobile it looks like I'm having some issues with this app hope you have to take a look at this TQ!!! and also I wanted to use a voice clip after I recorded something when I played it it didn't work apart from that is there any way of editing a comment on an IG feed? it just shows the delete icon,2
"Hey Instagram! Firstly iam congratulating to the people who created and developed these adorable platform as social media. I have an suggestion and that is when people will spending time on insta for some useful info it is must to save when it is came on face. so my opinion is to update these time in Instagram like 'save' button is available as same as like,comment and share buttons at reels page! Hope you will take a look on it.",2
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ""Exceptional Platform for Creativity and Connection!"" Instagram has been an absolute game-changer for me! I've found endless inspiration and a supportive community of like-minded individuals here. The platform's intuitive interface makes sharing my art, photography, and life moments a breeze.",2
"I'm from India I have been using Instagram since High School, and the journey I must say is so much fun and engaging. Reels, Filters, Editing tools and diverse content it provide makes Instagram fun and engaging flatform for users like me who is seeking enjoyable social media experience. I personally feel Instagram has helped me connect with my friends more, as its convenient sharing different fun videos, memes, etc. of our interest.",2
"Edit: all issues I had, have been fixed now (sorry for the swearing, I was very mad. As I had spent 30 mins, trying to get my account back, and view my new messages...) Great app, just has some bugs, that need fixing.",2
"Instagram is the best app I had ever used. There is variety of apps on playstore but I really like instagram. On this app you can see trending reels, pictures, videoes etc. but you can also able to upload your pictures and videoes here. I am happy to be a part of this app. I watch my fav celebrity daily pictures and routines. Also thanks to the team instagram for many this beautiful app. Love you from bengluru.",2
"18/05/23: Update. Still not working as mentioned below. 15/03/23: Can't follow anyone back and I'm not blocked or violated any rules. I click ""Follow Back"" and then it changes to ""Requested"" but then changes back to ""Follow Back"". This happens to everyone I try to follow back, not just one person. I've uninstall the app and reinstalled. It has the latest update. My phone is compatible and has Internet access that works. I've tried the Beta app, this normal app amd desktop but still no luck.",2
I am using this app from past 4 years and I feel like this is a best platform to show your talent and when ever they bring update there is something new and the features are mind blowing and there help service is also so many time i have for goted my password and tere service center help me out for getting back to my I'd and from past 4 years i have never seen any glich in this aap and never seen that my data has been licked at the end I want to say this app is mind blowing,2
It's been a fantastic time but be careful of who you chat with/ I still think it's fantastic I love it and use it everyday I get to explore different genres of music and hear new artists downfall Instagram needs to do a better job with imposters.,2
"Having utilized Instagram for over a decade, I can confidently attest to its excellence. This APK offers a seamless platform for connecting with a diverse community of individuals. Its user-friendly interface and plethora of features facilitate interaction and sharing among users, making it a preferred choice for engaging with gorgeous content and people.",2
"I love this app somuch. And there's so many things to do. You can post photos and videos like in Facebook and chat with your friends or even with your clebraties so In telegram, Snapchat or WhatsApp, you can only talk but in Instagram, You can even text or facetime to your favourite celebrities!!! That's crazy. And you can have followers and you can dance like your in Tiktok. And you can save your memories so, why using so many apps to text,facetime,post and dance, when. You have Instagram.😉",2
Just posting my thoughts.I just came here to request for an option just over the option of like(heart) because sometimes it happens to me when I just want to express over a reel that it is outstanding it just cross the level of likeness and this option should be like fire 🔥 shape. In future if Instagram could do that it would be great.,2
This app is great HOWEVER! it would be better when a friend sends you multiple reels and you can just scroll down to the other one rather than watching and going back to the chat to open another one,2
I have been able to reconnect with people who I haven't heard from or seen in years who instantly recognise and remember me. Insta is a great way to share to others what your day is like or what's on your mind at any given time. The platform is regularly updated with the best features and provides the fun aspect of life and existing. Try it out today for more of a fun use of social media.,2
"Instagram is so much fun! I love sharing photos and connecting with friends. It's a great platform to express yourself and discover new things. Plus, I enjoy following my favorite musicians and seeing what they're up to.",2
"I've only been using this for a few months, but it's worked OK for me with no glitches. It could have more options for editing photos, and considering it's an image-based app, it could be quicker to add alt text.",2
"It's one of the best social media apps available, and I've had it for 14 years. The upgrades are amazing, and this year is just better than the last. While I may not be experiencing any issues with the app, others are. While I am providing a positive review, it doesn't alter the fact that people have been complaining about it. The least the company could do is try to assist them; after all, it's your app, and I'm not trying to be disrespectful.",2
I've had this app since it's inception back in 2011? And Ive watched it change from a simple app to upload pics and videos to what we have now. It's very addicting to scroll thru the reels..1-2 hours just fly by. But I love ig.,2
"This is basically an amazing app considering how much of an effort it makes to get people who are shy like me to get online and interact with people who are from different countries and races. In fact, this deserves 6 stars. The reason for that is he variety of content creators and videos you can scroll through. This is actually so fun when you are kind of bored and nothing to dedicate your time to. Overall, amazing app",2
"It is really good and j don't see any bugs with it. But I don't like how when you remix a video, you HAVE to add smth onto the video. When I remix a video, I just want it the way it is but other than that, 😀 it's amazing.",2
"This app is very funny. Easy to upload on my devices. I enjoy the conversations that go on some humorous. Some down right insulting Wow over the top so ok ok, but it's all about how Americans treat each other. Not kool 😊 Thank you for hosting this the site. So many people interested in put in your opinion forward. I enjoy the commercials really do. You can put more on.",2
"can I suggest something? can Instagram provide setting like WhatsApp for 'hiding last seen from everyone', and add 'freeze my last seen' ? because I need to do something and I need that setting for more smooth planning, and I don't want anyone know that I did that thing. sokay, it's not about a bad thing but, it's the best thing for my surrounding people. There is a typing error in mi picks, but I don't know how to correct the spelling ** 'bad thing', not 'good thing '",2
"Hello, Instagram support, I would like to suggest a good suggestion to you, with the development of the videos, which was an excellent addition to the Instagram application in the recent period. Users started making writing stories or videos from movies, and it was divided into several videos. When a late person comes trying to find the second part of the clip, he does not find it among the huge number From the videos, you should add the option to follow, thank you.",2
"Instagram has been my go-to app for years, allowing me to connect with friends, share life's moments, and discover amazing content. From stunning photos to entertaining stories, it's a platform that keeps me engaged and connected. The user interface is intuitive, making it easy to navigate, and the constant updates keep things fresh. While I love Instagram, Il'd appreciate even more transparency about how my data is used. Overall, a must-have app for staying social and entertained!",2
"It provides a convenient way to share photos and videos, connect with friends, and discover new trends. The user interface is intuitive, making it easy to navigate. However, concerns about privacy and the impact on mental health have been raised. While the platform offers various features, such as stories and IGTV, the algorithmic feed can sometimes be frustrating.",2
Experience is nice and this app is also easy to use. I'm using this app on my free time and it is very interesting to use. In this app we can post photos and videos according to our choice and while using this app if someone misbehave or post something wrong about any particular thing we can also block them I am using this app since 2021.,2
"Good for socials. Has alot of great business tools that gather tons of information that I can use to successfully run a business on instagram. Also allows for quick messaging & connections/networking with friends, family, associates & etc. I like the Instagram app.",2
"I'm still trying to get the hang of it. It's certainly not like Facebook. I pretty well have Facebook down pat But the good thing about Instagram is that you can find most of your friends here, only a lot of the people who are in here, aren't truly on here, they just list themselves and then go back to Facebook or somewhere else. I'm doing a little better than I was when I wrote that first part, but not a whole lot better. But at least I've learned how to post on there.",2
"It's amazing, I really enjoyed it by watching reels and stories. I keep in contact with my loved ones. I also aware from the world updates. It have been working excellent 👌, It is an good way to keep it in contact with your family, friends present in any corner of the world. My friends and family can share any update or enjoy able reels and posts with me. I really appreciate the Instagram team that they are working brilliant. May god bless you all! It might be soon the biggestplatform all over",2
"i love the ""its getting late. consider closing instagram for the night."" notice!!! its very helpful for me because i always stay up late from doomscrolling, losing track of time. I hope the feature is kept. I like the concern for users especially now with people ruining their health due to unli short videos.",2
"Hello, Instagram support, I would like to suggest you a good suggestion with the development of videos, which has been a great addition to the Instagram application in recent times. Users started writing stories or videos from movies, which were divided into several videos. When a latecomer tries to find the second part of the clip and doesn't find it in large numbers from the videos, you should add the follow option, thanks.✨🥰",2
Positive: Instagram is a visually appealing platform with a focus on photos and videos. It offers a wide range of creative tools for photo editing and storytelling. The Explore feature helps discover new content and accounts. Negative: Some users have reported issues with the algorithm showing content out of order. The app can be addictive and time-consuming. Privacy concerns have arisen regarding data usage and targeted advertising.,2
"Amazing app to use to text friends, but in the new notes feature, I don't have the feature to add songs to the note, kindly fix this issue as it is happening to many others as well.",2
"I've been using VN Video Editor for a while now, and it's become my go-to mobile video editing app. It's incredibly user-friendly, which is perfect for someone like me who doesn't have much experience with video editing. The trimming and merging features are straightforward to use, and I love how easy it is to add transitions, filters, and music to my videos. The selection of stickers and text options allows me to get creative and add a personal touch to my videos. I highly recommend it.",2
"Wow, it's really user friendly but it would have been if we able to see all the filters, stickers in one place instead of searching with words.. because we won't be having any idea what it's stored.. otherwise I love this application",2
"""Instagram continues to impress with its user-friendly interface and innovative features. The recent updates have enhanced the overall experience, making it easier to connect with friends, discover new content, and express creativity. Keep up the great work!""",2
"I loved this app for making content. The tools for editing videos and music available are great, but i think they need to make it accessible to new post",2

"Terrible update!! Facebook needs to fix this thing. now my notifications don't pop up anymore even though I've double checked the settings in both places and they are on. I hate the new layering of photos because you don't even know they are there. it says it's sending a message but it takes forever. Received photos don't always load. It says I have no internet connection even when I do. Facebook needs to dump this update, go back to the last one, and work on it more!",0
"I wish I could attach screenshots. I don't know what they're trying to do but I'm about to just start using my laptop. It's very clear they prioritize optimal performance for IOS and not Android. Any reel, voice message, photo, etc (any attachment at all really) doesn't show up. I closed out the app, turned off chatheads, restarted my phone after fully closing out the app, and NOTHING has worked. Not to mention how the photos look now when you send them? Who is that for? Please fix the app.",0
"As I write this review, I have been a user of messenger for YEARS. Never has the app had so many END to END issues (get it?)... First off, the end-to-end encryption seems to be the culprit, the reason being that since they deployed it I, and it seems like others have had numerous issues. The images/gifs sent to me never seem to load! Also, I send emails to the feedback department, but never hear back from them. I know they probably can't reply to everything, but my problems go unresolved!!!!!!!",0
"It always ignores Do Not Disturb mode, even when I tell it not to. I try setting a custom ringtone (because the default one is annoying) but the settings never stick. Like most facebook products, I only have it because of the 1 or 2 friends who can't be contacted otherwise. This app definitely deserves an award for ""most ear-grating sound design."" Who listened to the default notification sounds and thought they were a good idea?",0
"Notifications don't work anymore! I've cleared cache, storage, uninstalled and reinstalled on two different pixel phones, but notifications won't pop up or make a sound (and I do know what I'm doing and how to check all the settings...). Without notifications working, there's no way of knowing if someone is asking about or replying to an item from marketplace, which is the primary reason for using it. This sucks.",0
"This app was amazing when I first got it. Easy a 5 star app. Then over the past half year it started going downhill. Notifications stop working, when they do work it's hours later. Voice messages freeze and I need to wait when it wants to work. Chat head randomly cut off and I need to open the app properly to load a message. While writing this I moved the review from 2 to 1 stars. I don't understand how you can manage to piss off every single user, but you manage to get that right at least.",0
"Terrible. I've had to uninstall and reinstall this app many times and STILL doesn't work properly. End to end encryption? Seriously? Nobody cares. You force us to choose something no matter what and we shouldn't have to. Keeps showing ""no internet connection"" for some reason when my wifi and phone internet are fine. I have to close the app completely and open it again just to see new messages. So frustrated with whatever changes you guys made. I hate using this now. There were no issues before.",0
"I am frustrated with the issues that have appeared with the latest update. The app fails to recognize Internet connection at least once per hour. I have to force stop the app and reopen it to fix that issue. Chats will only mark as read after I respond to them. So there are multiple chats that are bolded in my list, and pressing the ""mark as read"" button has no effect. I also miss being able to see the time a message was read. I hope to see a reparative update soon.",0
"The most recent update made it like Instagram messaging, which sucks. It lumps all the bulk photos together in a weird pile so you cant see all of the photos in one go, you have to click into them individually to see them all. You no longer can send long videos - even a 24 second video it claims is too big and had to be resized. This was exclusively how my wife and I sent large videos to each other. Constantly saying I have unread messages. Fix your app, it worked just fine before.",0
"Whatever update occurred, I can no longer receive notifications from my messenger unless i click into it. Then they all appear from hours ago. I have un-installed the app, reinstalled it, and made sure the notifications are turned on, both on my phone and the app. I have no idea how to fix it, and I'm missing messages that someone sent me hours before, and I don't know I'm receiving them. Please fix this!",0
"A couple things. First, I really wish the end call button was in the middle. Being a lefty it's annoying having to reach all the way over to the right corner to hit the end button. Second, and most importantly, I despise the search button in the text box! I accidentally hit the search button almost every single time I reach for the send button and it only gives me more work. Give us the option to turn it off! Every time an issue gets fixed, a new one pops up that's even more infuriating",0
Update ruined it... you suddenly can't attach videos?? Then the whole group of photos stacked on top of each other - worst feature! I don't want to have to scroll through each picture and never know how many more and not be able to just select the one I want to enlarge. Super buggy and doesn't play videos half the time. Please undo everything you did in the latest update. Absolutely terrible.,0
"This new update is awful! I can no longer search for things said prior to the update (discovered while searching for a link a friend had sent). If someone posts a link that should open in another app, it not only doesn't open, but doesn't give me the option to open the app to view it. It also performs much slower since the update. Edit: IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK WELL WITH OTHER META APPS!!! I just tried to share something from Insta via Messenger, and it won't even do that!",0
"The recent update with end to end encryption is nothing but issues. Cannot search gif. Messages are not marked as read. And BIGGEST annoyance is when multiple pictures are sent, it stacks them all into 1 place instead of spreading them out. Now you can NOT see the thumbnails and how many pictures are there. Whose idea is this? It's so frustratingly stupid.",0
"The app is going downhill. It breaks every other day. Voice memos don't record, and when they do, you can't record for long because they just delete themselves. When the voice memos are broken, you can't send pictures or anything else either.. call quality is horrible, and I wouldn't recommend it either. Hackers and scammers everywhere, especially on Facebook market place it's just a poor app.. Meta has really let Messenger die, and it's disappointing.",0
"I've had messenger for years without any issue. Within the last several months it's crashing daily. It just locks up, and I have to remove and reinstall it several times a day. I wish I knew how to fix it. Update 12-15: You can't fix this issue? It still locks up nearly every day. Sometimes two or three times... Update 3/24 messenger still crashes multiple random times every day. And now when it does, it makes certain previous messages disappear and revert back to the same place.",0
"This new update is absolutely atrocious. This is just another example of fixing something that wasn't broken. Who asked for images to all be stacked into one pile? It was perfectly fine the way it was before. Also, other features have seemingly been done away with; the react emoji no longer swells when you hold it, and the word effects feature (which sent the emoji of your choosing when you sent the key word) only works sometimes.",0
"I do not like the updates. I'm missing several avatar stickers; some I can only use on the computer or only on my phone. I'm unable to view complete chat histories, which I kept for many reasons. I don't like/want the added AI features. I'm now unable to view stickers in my chats that are sent to me unless I click on it or have to view on a computer. These are just a few dislikes that I can remember at the moment along with what others have mentioned. If this is a beta test, it failed",0
Bad update for sure! Dropped video calls. I can't seem to watch any reels sent to me. I get a page not found error message on every single reel sent to me. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and I have quadruple checked my messenger settings and Facebook settings and nothing. This new update sucks so much. When are you guys going to fix this? How many negative feedback is it going to take before the numerous issues your update caused are to be repaired.,0
"Constantly having to uninstall and reinstall because it's saying I have unread messages, when I don't. Perfect internet, and perfect reception. But my messages won't get delivered for awhile. Honestly this app is just getting worse and worse. Pictures aren't loading, saying they're high resolution.. I have great service. So I'm not sure why that keeps happening.",0
"I was forced to do the update as my messenger wouldn't work otherwise. It is so screwed up now. Layers photos if they go through, takes forever to send a video. Weird pop ups of conversations, says internet isn't connected when it is. I deleted the app and reinstalled to sees if that would fix it, it didn't. This update is absolutely awful. We need the option to delete this upgrade and go back to this app working properly.",0
"Used to be able to record 30 min messages. They stop at 10 now. Videos were never an issue sending. Now? Can't send more than 25mb. Used to be able to scroll through a persons text messages while listening to their voice message. Nope. Not now. Scroll past the message playing and it stops. Talk to text spells out punctuation rather than actually punctuating the sentence. If I'm lucky, I can get a voice message to play after pressing play about 5x. Need I go? Because I could! Worthless.",0
"This app has progressively gotten worse. And now the so-called encryption. You mean to tell me you didn't have this before ??. Lots of bugs with the latest update. Status lights are either on or off at any time. Send or received messages, are lagging for hours before it shows on my home screen. Messages from the other party, are not highlighted in bold white. Until I click on that person and then it shows. Read receipts not showing that person viewed the message. Tech support no reply to issues",0
"I hate it now. Every since the update and then adding the ""end to end encryption"" I have been having so many issues sending pictures and videos to my loved ones. Things that I could normally send is now too large to send and I'm unable to receive photos from my friends because the resolution is too large to open. It's so frustrating. I heavily relied on messenger over my phone's messaging because I was able to send and receive pictures and videos in its original format. Now it's just trash. Smh",0
The latest update is horrible. I don't have the online friends list anymore which is really aggravating. I'm not receiving notifications. I've had to uninstall and redownload the app 3 times now. The meta AI is literally the most useless feature. It knows nothing about how to fix something if you have a problem. Each update y'all do continuously makes the app worse. If it's not broke leave it alone!!! 🤬,0
"Ever since a recent update, this app will often not send messages. Wildly inconsistent. Not a good thing for a messenging application. Before this update (weeks ago), it already struggled with basic functions - like loading the file folder to send pics/attachments. META may be a billions-of-dollars company, but they sure do dabble in incompetence more frequently than not.",0
"The recent updates are awful!! I can no longer send the videos I've always sent in the past. Now it says the limit is 25mg. I have 3-4 minute videos that I don't want to post on Facebook, but I can't even send thru messenger anymore, and text isn't an option. This is extremely upsetting to me. Why can't companies leave things alone. If it works, leave it alone. It won't even play videos I sent in the past. This was the one place I could share. I will have to figure some place else out. 🤬🤬🤬🤬",0
"Terrible update since end-to-end. For one thing, the photos being lumped together SUCKS. I can no longer search for things in my chat that was said BEFORE the update, which makes it really hard to re-read bits of information or conversations said YEARS ago. FIX THIS PART ASAP! It takes FOREVER for a voice message/video to start playing now. Like MINUTES sometimes. There are other problems I've come across but I can't think of them right now. I'd really prefer you to just revert this update.",0
"The last couple updates have rendered the app useless as a messaging application on mobile devices. Pics and more specifically videos are ""unable to send"" despite being sell within the parameters for video messaging convenience. Just about ready to uninstall and disable any form of meta messaging. Edit: a 50mb update and suddenly TWO GIGABYTES gone??? That's it. 0 stars if i could. Your incompetence as a company is too much.",0
"Unusable with recent updates. Can no longer see previous history or attachments due to some new update... Great, I guess I didn't want to see those ten years of data. Logged in with another laptop? Password. Text code. Trust laptop. Oh that's not enough, go through the whole process a second time or your messages won't sync. Thanks, I'm done. Will find something else. Honestly if not for messenger I wouldn't log into Facebook so... Good luck?",0
"New update is absolute garbage. Tries to make links out of every period, hides random pictures for no reason. Unwanted end to end encryption. Cant write the word imagine without it trying to shove ai down my throat. Was fine, but as of late, it's barely functioning. It's always saying it's not connected to network even though im on wifi and have unlimited data. Today, it started refusing to send any media and wasn't giving me a reason.",0
"End-to-end encryption has completely ruined the entire Messenger experience. Can't view photos in a chat, can't use the growing emojis, makes unnecessary links for no reason, no preview for links or videos shared, etc. How can you be such a huge company and release something so low quality? Go back to the way it was - ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"".",0
"The latest update has ruined any communication with videos and audio. It was the only was I can send a good and bigger video from android to iPhone. It updates last week. Now there are videos 15 seconds that say too large to send, some will send at 20, but the majority over 10 seconds says too large to send. If I can get it to send it is extremely blurry and sounds weird.",0
"TERRIBLE UPDATE. used to love using Messenger app, had no issues. Whatever they were trying to fix with the new update, they broke everything. Pics being lumped together is ridiculous. Notifications not popping. And ENTIRE MESSAGE THREADS not even showing up in the app. I have to go through the Messenger icon from the FB app. Like it's not syncing. What's the point then?? Please fix it or delete the new ""improvements"" this is so bad.",0
"Very recently, this app lost the ability to play voice messages. It was briefly remedied by a complete uninstall and re-install. However, the fix was short-lived, reverting within less than 12 hrs. This appears to have been remedied, however now my voice messages fail to send at all, and in fact vanish once the app is closed.",0
"Between my long distance partner not getting my messages, not having the gifs they send to me load, and calls dropping or being so pixelated that I can't see them at all (video in calls does not work), I am so frustrated with this app. I tried calling my mom, too, and even she noticed I was Pixelated? I'm so confused as to why or how this is still happening. It's been happening for months, but now it's to the point that the app just won't let me video call. I get dropped calls, too",0
"Every time there's a new update, less and less things work in this app. I can no longer just swipe up to close a chat head, I can't record a voice message that automatically sends after letting go of the microphone, thumbnails no longer show when links are sent, and half the time the links don't even open. Get it together and stop releasing these updates that are downgrades. Please.",0
"I don't like the layout for uploading pics. It looks like I only sent one pic instead of multiples. I still haven’t been able to receive most of my messages on time for several months now. I'm stuck using this app to communicate with my coworkers, but most of my messages appear later. It's causing me issues at work. I've uninstalled and installed this app and restarted my phone. But I'm still getting the same problems.",0
"I've lost all my chat history with some people. Sometimes it shows new messages when there aren't any. Sometimes it doesn't show new messages at all unless I look for them myself. I can't send a big or medium quick react icon anymore, just small (which sucks, I liked using big hearts). Sending multiple images now in one stack where you have to open the stack and search through all of them instead of seeing a small preview of each. This app is trash",0
I've never left a review before but this is ridiculous. I have a chat with a close friend I message every day and I can't even search older conversations now thanks to the End to End encryption. I've been trying to search certain prompts to find pictures of her dog that has passed and videos/pictures of my horses that have passed and now they're all gone. Unless I want to scroll YEARS worth of stuff or scroll through YEARS of photos I guess it's just all lost. Thanks idiots.,0
"Terrible update since end-to-end. For one thing, the photos being lumped together SUCKS. can no longer search for things in my chat that was said BEFORE the update, which makes it really hard to re-read bits of information or conversations said YEARS ago.

Il'd really prefer you to just revert this update.",0
"Had messenger for years, calling almost every day and texting every day. Recently I was forced to update it and it would not let me use it without the update. After doing it the gallery function in text changed. When tapping on something from gallery, you have the options of edit or send. Usually you can't tell what image of video it is so you tap edit to see then the back button. But now the update made it to where backing out of edit takes you to the top of gallery no matter what.",0
"Recent Samsung updates keep breaking this app. Sending and receiving messages are hitbor miss. Calls are delayed and it doesn't even ring. If anyone changed their profile pic, the app keep flip flopping between the old and new. My issues are with notifications. I get them randomly or none at all. No sound, no pop-up. I have to manually unlock my phone to check because it doesn't sound just like the old days. Might do a reinstall since there was a new update just yesterday.",0
"It's just issue after issue. Today, it won't let me send photos, another I can't use the camera feature, another the video call service will fail to load the recipients video. My Internet is verified more than fast enough, and I'm on a brand new phone. It's a crummy app. On top of this, the BEST feature (chat heads) is super buggy if rotation is on. And they used to nicely integrate with the other chat app message bubbles (text messages, etc), but now they're separate again",0
"With every ""improvement "" this app gets worse. If this is genuinely the best the team can do, it's about time they were fired for being utterly incompetent. Messages take hours to go through, unable to hear voice messages (which work fine when listening on PC), notifications for old messages. I was sitting literally right next to my friend, both on wifi connection that was rock solid. He sent me a message & it took 45 minutes for me to get it. And he showed as off line. These are not ""1 offs""",0
This new end-to-end encryption for security is annoying I don't get my messages tell I actually open the app and then sometime I don't even get them for hours later. Or even when I actually messaging back in forth with someone it's shows that the message isn't delivered but shows they are active. And they are sitting in the same room as me so I know for sure it's the updateband it should be an option not something messenger just does because they want to. Also what with the supports address?,0
"An app I originally used for it's ease and the ability to use on both PC and Mobile... that has now decided to undo all of that in exchange for forced ""added security"" of a 6 digit pin or locking all messages behind a single device. I'll never understand why these kinds of changes are forced but it's now forcing me to find an alternative. Thanks Meta, you've proven very successful in consistently driving away your audience with every change you do In the past few years. Absolutely useless.",0
"Until recently this app worked fine, however in the past week I have to uninstall and reinstall this app daily in order to keep using it due to a ""feature"" they are trying to force that requires a pin. Whenever this feature is suggested to me, I can no longer use the app, as the popup cannot be dismissed and it shows up over every single instance of the app, like chat heads. As soon as I've talked to everyone about an alternative means of contact, I'm deleting this app for good!",0
"I have had problems with this app before when it comes to poor video quality on FaceTime, but never anything like the end-to-end encryption. I'm not even saying anything mean about one person to someone else and how you went and deleted some of my messages or made the other person unsee my messages makes no sense at all. The end-to-end encryption is ridiculous and unnecessary so please STOP THIS NOW. The only person who should delete any of my messages is me.",0
"Bugs and inconsistencies have made this app very hard to use. Pinning and searching in chats is hit or miss from chat to chat. I am unable to click on massage from someone's profile. It wants me to create a new profile instead of opening a chat with the person. I use this app all day, every day, and it no longer functions as it did two months ago. It seems each ""upgrade"" gets worse, and more functionality is lost.",0
"I can't listen to audio messages sent. Messenger either won't play them, or it'll act like it's playing them but nothing is coming through my speakers (yes, my volume is on). If I have multiple chat heads open, it'll send different emotes than the one that's selected in place of the thumbs up. My app is up to date. I've tries restarting my phone. I've tried closing and reopening the app. Nothing helps.",0
"Edit: now often the keyboard covers up the chat so I can't see what I'm typing. This app keeps getting worse and worse. Edit: now when I try to take a photo within a chat, landscape photos just disappear. I either have to take a portrait photo within the chat or exit messenger to take a landscape photo then share it in the chat. Original review: can no longer browse to picture folders to share, for example, screen shots or other folders than the main photo folder. very annoying.",0
I have a business page and I'm not getting any links or messages on my business page that I'm getting from other pages that I follow through my business page. I have tried everything to get these messages which are VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR MY BUSINESS. There is no way to even see them it's not even an option to see the messages. This needs to be fixed. It was a horrible update to the app.,0
"Like many others, I can no longer access my chat history or search in my conversations after having end-to-end encryption forced onto me. I often search my chats for old information or photos, and now when I try, I only get search results from the last few days on chats I've had for over a decade. If a feature is going to completely purge our chat history, it should say that up front and be opt-in, not force us to use it unceremoniously.",0
"I turn on the microphone to send a message and guarenteed it only shows one word and stops recording. What is going on with this app now? It's gotten even worse. If you video chat with somebody, you should be able to delete it when you're done and it won't let you until you put in either an emoji or make a comment. Now, when you're going into messenger, you've got all this AI and chat suggestions. The page is crowded",0
"The forced end to end encryption RUINED my chats, I can no longer look up past messages or reply to them if I manage to manually scroll through tons of messages just to find the 1 thing. There's no toggle to turn off encryption. I never wanted this encryption but I couldn't access messanger at all without accepting it randomly popping up in app one day. It needs to go.",0
"Normally love this app, but lately it hasn't let me listen to audio messages. I'll click play and they won't play. I have an S22 ultra and my app is up to date so that is not an issue. I have to close out of the app and reopen multiple times for it to work. And that isn't even working most of the time now. Hopefully they work this bug out if it isn't just me.",0
My phone pops up and says I have a new message on Facebook Marketplace but when I click on it to read it. The Messenger App opens but it is not there yet... (Sometimes takes an hour for the message to show up!?!) I have to manually go to the Facebook App and click on the item I'm selling and then check for new messages to see the message there!?! (It has never been this way before the latest update) (This problem also applies to my replies to the messages that don't show up in the messenger app),0
I have sent in several reports on update end of March. I no longer get notifications and before anyone says anything... Yes notifications are on. The only way I get messages is to be in the app. Makes no sense! Can I please go back to and uninstall update. Of course it's been days and still no help and I'm not going to be in messenger 24 hours a day to keep a conversation going. Frustrating!!,0
"Bad update. Few bugs that need fixing: 1. Not being able to send a photo in Messenger if it's a photo that I originally saved from Messenger (error message says ""sorry, this photo format isn't supported in Messenger yet""(yes it is)) 2. New bug that constantly jumps me back down to the most recent chats if I'm scrolled up to older ones 3. Having to wait a few seconds after minimizing a chat bubble before being able to interact with anything again (didn't used to happen)",0
"Recent update complaint... Now it's automatically switched chats to end to end encryption and no way to change it!... As usual, custom sounds still don't work for different chats... only plays the main app sound I chose... Also...Keeps turning off pop up setting in the notifications options. Very annoying... Hafta keep turning it back on when it does that often...",0
"As of 2/7/24, just now reporting but why can't I retrieve messages from people I don't know? When I go to the messages setting in settings the wheel just spins. Same if I look at the spam. Nothing comes but sometimes days later, the message will appear. ALSO, why is my message button gone? This app is useless. Not able to read messages. Cant retrieve my archived messages. Messages disappearing. COME ON META, DO BETTER. YOU GET PAID ENOUGH!!! 6/8/23 Ongoing issues. Wth is the problem you guys?",0
"Limited voice message length after 3/6/24. I had the ability to record 30 min audio messages before the systemwide crash experienced by 100,000+ users. Now only, 10 minutes. It is extremely frustrating to try to have any useful discussion with other users who have not been limited to 10 min. I have contacted help and support without any response. Disappointed to say the least.",0
"This new update was absolutely horrible. No longer have the ability to edit my messages, location sharing was removed, floating emojis are worse now, and the whole app feels like it runs 50% slower... All for encrypting data. All the things I liked about the app are gone now. I tolerated the crashes, data leaks, and issues. I put up with my videos and messages not sending, but this is just really bad now. Will be looking for alternatives.",0
"App sends messages 1/2 the time if that. On wifi doesn't connect to network to allow you to send messages. You have to shut down app/clear cache & re-boot to have messages go like normal. Every time out. Constant ""Waiting for network"" or ""Connecting"" messages using data/or with wi-fi connection. App blows, use something else if you want to communicate. 0 stars if I could. Still can't fix issues after months of same problems. I keep updating this review b/c 6 months later, issue STILL persists.",0
"I don't like that Facebook Messenger removed my option to customize my resolution settings and that it throttles down my resolution as it sees fit. And for the last month it has been crashing on me a lot, especially, while viewing videos that people send in chats. But sometimes the crash is even when just scrolling down the list of conversations. Now they even stack my attachments instead of spreading them out in the chat, do I can't click on each individual one. Stop messing with user options.",0
"The app worked alright before the update. It's slow, too slow. Won't load any videos when I click on them and for whatever reason I cannot figure out even tho I've checked everywhere, it never rings thru. It'll show someone called me but never rings when someone is calling me. Just shows they did call me. Very annoying and seriously considering getting rid of the app entirely becuz it's too much of a headache and with it not working properly I'm fed up!!🤬🤬🤬",0
"It was fine how it was, but now I can't turn off end to end encryption, and it's extremely frustrating.... I didn't want it in the first place, and it just shows up... my friend passed away, that's where I was getting the information... I want this off!!!!! I'm not getting notifications from it, and it's annoying!!!!! I WANT IT GONE!!!!! I CANT TURN IT OFF! I JUST WANT MY NORMAL CONVERSATIONS BACK!!!!",0
"Forced to use the end to end encryption & now i can't search through a chat to find a number or file. Why limit this? Calls will be missed and no alert will come across for hours. Same for random messages, there will be major delay. We tested & confirmed it's not the internet. Also its very annoying that when looking at a post or video someone sends you, the back feature on your phone or the apps back arrow takes you to your feed vs back to the conversation.",0
"Editing this comment to say the app is only getting worse and worse, with more features being removed every update, in exchange for ""soundmojis"" Quit it. It's clear this app isn't cared for. Just give us back Photo Editing, old bubbles, and our positive experience we had years back. New Edit: more and more features leave as time goes on. Don't install, just use What'sapp or Telegram.",0
"Hardly works half the time, then they make the app more ugly with the security update. Thanks but I don't need a reminder that I can ""double tap the message to leave a like"" after literally every message. Also, got rid of the ""seen"" feature, why? Emojis seem to like to break too. For such a large company, meta seems to really like consistently screw it up. (Edit: I'm stupid, the ""seen"" feature is still there, they just got rid of the two little bubbles we had before and it just looks uglier.)",0
"Always a plethora of issues. Lately now, when people send me a link it opens a Facebook page and says page not found. Up until a couple months ago, when people sent links they also wouldn't work, but at least they'd load the page with the correct URL so I could just copy the link and open in browser. Now though, links just open dead ""page not found"". I found a workaround to the other problem and messenger immediately found a workaround to my workaround in order to keep giving me problems.",0
"Used to be the best way to send anything from videos to $$... lately, not even videos work more or less send money. I'm unsure as to what changed, but you guys should fix it. Otherwise, thr use of this app is pointless for someone as myself. Theres other and better chat messages systems that just work but this was a happy does it all easy to use app that was able to cover so many areas.",0
"The latest few updates have ruined the app, especially the forced end to end encryption, which has ruined many things including gifs so that the same search between conversations that have been ""upgraded"" and not bring up various gifs so we don't have access to commonly used gifs, it has removed the ability to share locations, which is really useful for finding each other when meeting up, and the app is less stable, for instance randomly jumping to the last message when I am reading previous",0
"Used to be a five star app, now it's incredibly glitchy. Sometimes it won't let me open a chat, or scroll back to earlier messages- or if it does let me scroll back, it won't let me scroll back down again to the current messages. I often have to close and force stop the app. Sometimes voice messages don't load at all. Annoying. Edit: It's been a year and no change.",0
"Edited - I have never had any issues with this app for the many years I've used it, then suddenly for the past year or 2 I've stopped getting notifications half the time, messages just wont get delivered to me or the people I'm sending messages to, and now every time there's a new update, things just get worse. I had to uninstall because it kept saying meta business suite error and wouldn't send my messages, and it keeps booting me out and won't let me log in now.",0
"This app use to be amazing but with recent updates, it freezes my screen whenever a bubble pops up. Then I get a message saying that messenger is not compatible with my phone. (S22 ultra). It also doesn't update the messages when it's sent / received on the chat history so I can't follow who has messaged me recently. Messages that I have read stays on unread and keeps popping up. Please fix these issues ASAP.",0
Edit: always have to delete app data to get bubbles back. Wish I could give no stars. Nothing has been done about this issue and it's getting worse. F Facebook Ever since they updated I have to at least once a week delete all my data and cache to get my bubbles to work again. Bubbles are turned on for all conversations and so are notifications but nothing pops up when I get a message until I delete my data and start fresh.,0
"Your new update is garbage. I had to go through all my old marketplace messages and leave each one, then delete each one so it doesn't show at the top of the list. I un-installed and will reinstall the program. Please fix it and make it better. I really would like to opt out of the group community chats that appears on the menu bar and hide them as I don't use that feature. You have to give your customers options to customize their experiences or they'll stop using it.",0
"Messenger permissions are allowed for everything, including displaying over other apps and running in the background. However I am not getting message notifications on my phone. Sometimes I unlock my phone and see a chat head with a message that I was never notified about. I can miss a message by hours because I was never notified. This issue started a few months ago and I reported the issue and nothing has been done.",0
"This app is absolutely horrible now. I can't do what was so simple. Like make my quick reaction big. So simple but yet it can't do it, my friend can do it. Like it's annoying when you have an app that works perfectly fine majority of the time, maybe add some cool features here and there but to do an unwanted overhaul on the app is beyond stupid. Wanted access to my Google account?!? Instead I made a pin smh. It's a Facebook conversation I pretty sure nobody was too worried about message security",0
Used to be great but is now I'd send messages to certain people and all it does is glitches and lags but messages eventually go through once the receiver looks to see if I messaged but it's usually certain people but others it goes through immediately but when I call the person I sent the message or messages to they go through like seriously either fix the issues or you will lose people. Fix the bug that shows whether people are really active or not mine has been having this issue lately.,0
It was great until the most recent update. Forces you to either create a pin to access your messages. Checks for alternate options. Picks save to Google account. Proceeds to infinitely load and not let me click on the account I would use. I love new security options that lock me out of my own stuff and don't work in any capacity.,0
"This app worked great, till recently. Possibly the last month or so, if I want to check a profile from messenger it wants me to log in or create an account. This happens 3/4 of the times. Some days I can't get into FB at all from messenger. I use FB a lot and messenger. This really needs fixed. It's never been a problem before. Now I'm not able to rate a buyer or vice versa. I can't check profiles. Check details etc. Awful!!!",0
"Messages can no longer be opened. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app just to see the messages. Sometimes, the app immediately closes after opening it. I hope these bugs will be fixed soon. Edit: switched to 1 star because of the forced encryption and codes. It's harder to view messages across devices and mostly unusable. I just wanted to send a quick message yet it won't let me to most people. Some even show an error pop up when using other devices in an attempt to chat. Terrible.",0
"This has been my main messaging app since forever, but I've decided to switch. This app gets more and more unusable as updates pass. Bugs are being added instead of getting patched. Some of the new ""features"" are more of a nuisance than actual usable features. When they do add actually good features, they are very inconsistent and sometimes completely disappear, and other basic functions of the app just fail or get more buggy.",0
"I don't leave reviews for apps, but messager became so bad, I had to. 1) You cannot scroll messages anymore when you hear a voice message 2) the said voice messages STOPS *EVERY* TIME someone sends something or even starts typing. Like it can happen every one second for no reason whatsoever. 3) if you delete the app and download it again there are no new messages!!!! I am using it more than 10 years but honestly doesn't worth it anymore. How can they even improve so many issues at once",0
"The recent end-to-end encryption update is incredibly frustrating and seems unnecessary to me. It brings numerous drawbacks, such as the loss of all messages, the inability to search for messages, difficulties in managing files, messages disappearing even if unread, and the disappearance of pinned messages. If I could, I would give this update a rating of 0.",0
"The Bug are Terrible!!!! I have experienced so many bugs, and i see that it hasn't been resolved yet. When someone sends me a photo, it doesn't load at all, even if my WiFi is working fast, It still won't load, plus there's a bug when you open a reel someone sent, it'll open a different reel, This led me to miscommunication to the people I'm chatting, Please fix this i appreciate it.",0
"It was a good app UNTIL NOW. This is the Worst update that we received. The old Messages cannot be read again. Chat heads are now functioning properly. My quick reaction is only thumbs up even if a change it. Sharing links doesn't redirect you to the right platform. I just don't see the importance of this stupid update. Rather than fixing the call, audio, video call, the quality of pictures and video sent, supporting larger files to be shared. You just added more reason to delete this app.",0
"We understand that the update is for our safety and privacy but this end-to-end encryption sucks! It's so hard to switch account and log in into different devices, it's so time consuming especially when your waiting for your messages to load! Almost an hour for messages to load! And it keeps bugging, like suddenly you won't receive any messages and some of your messages can't be sent. Remove this feature please, it's so hard to use and we're not familiar in this one. WORST UPDATE!!",0
"I don't like the updated end to end encryption. You should remove that feature because it was so complicated. Bring back the old one. We should allow to access all of our messages in every devices. And we should still manage to access it, even we uninstalled the app and installed it again. I understand it's for the safety but the old one is still best, not this updated feature or end to end encryption.",0
The end to end encryption update is just a huge disappointment to the users. Especially for the ones who needs and cherish old messages in their conversations. You can't even search for old messages anymore. I hope you can fix this or better yet bring back the old messenger where there is no end to end encryption. It was way better and accessible back then.,0
"The search function only shows results from before this update too. Very frustrating. Why is the text squashed to the sides after the ""end to end encryption"" updates. Text / chat boxes used to extend 2/3 of the way across my screen, so you could get quite a lot of words (8) on each line. Now it just fits 4. A long message is going to be hard to read. And I don't want to ""double tap"" to like every fricking message. I bet I can't turn that option off either.",0
"Dismal at best. Prior to the mass Meta crash that had happened, messenger was working okay. Not perfect, but okay. it has, however, gotten increasingly worse as time has gone on. It's gotten to the point where I have to consistently refresh my inbox, disconnect and reconnect to my wifi/internet connection, and close/reopen my messenger app SEVERAL times, and if I don't, it'll take upwards of 3 hours before any messages I send will send. It's broken to no end. Please fix this broken mess.",0
"It has gotten somewhat better, but it's still not as good as it used to be, so the rating won't change for now. Older parts of conversations are not loading, the notifications are horrendously delayed, searching in conversation is still broken (doesn't load all messages containing a certain word; often doesn't work at all; I'd also suggest to make the searching more precise). It still does take up to 30min to load one message. Every update makes it work slower and makes it worse.",0
"Super cool that you've added a garbage AI feature but still haven't fixed major issues like NOT BEING ABLE TO SEND MESSAGES. I've had messenger since messenger first became a thing and never issues. Now, these last 6 months it's been non-stop. The majority of the time I can't even message 90% of my contacts. It just says 'sending' forever, then if I close the convo, it disappears like I never sent anything to begin with. I've started looking for a messenger alternative. This app is ruined.",0
"The new update of messenger is so confusing. I hope it will be back the way we used to before. Some of my convo's with my friend is unavailable and the other photos in media and files are gone which is so disappointing. In addition to that some of the conversation with my specific friend don't pop up when I don't used the app and when I opened it, the message was already been seen even if I didn't open our conversation yet.",0
"It's just USELESS, there is no point of the bubbles. Can't open more than one, you open one contact and it shows other, can't send or receive pictures, it has problems with updating the conversations ""no connection"" (doesn't matter if is WiFi or mobile data). If you want to chat with somebody use other programs or pigeons :) (still faster than the app...)",0
"Compared to the iPhone version, the android version leaks an important feature. Facebook market chat, it does not show the price of the item or anywhere to view the link. Especially for someone like me who sells multiple items. Sometimes people message, and I have no idea which item and the price I set. I have to go on the laptop or pc to check. It's very annoying. Update Facebook seems to have fixed the above issue. Fingers cross, next update does not break it.",0
Hasooooool,0
"didnt store the message from pc it was visible than cp, automatically refreshing on its own and removing message from pc without storing it.",0
Whenever i try to make a pin for the end-to-end encryption it always loads and then back to making the pin again. I tried this 5 times already but to no avail. This is so frustrating as I can't access my messages since I have to make the pin first.,0
Not good bro nct time make it no laoding couse it takes time to chat,0
1/5. Would have been better if end to end encryption wasn't there. I hate this update. I might JUST DELETE MY MESSENGER,0

"Not getting notifications until I open the app or FB app. This is very annoying because I am missing important messages from friends and family because they choose to use it more. I don't stay on FB for hours at a time, really not more than a few minutes a day tbh. This new update sucks. It was fine before the update, I would get my notifications. Now even when I open it it says waiting for network like it doesn't stay connected til I open it.",0
HATE THIS SYNC CONVERSATION NEW STUFF.,0

Did not show up for a meeting after an hour drive.,0
"No response, Don't have any solution to solve the account problem",0
I would say I would give it 5 stars because it's the app I used to use to keep in touch with my love ones since I moved so far away from them but for some reason the app won't let me on it I have tried to uninstall the app and restall it agian to see if I could fix it but now it won't even let me in it at all to even sign into now so untill fixed I have to rate with one star,0
Hate it with a passion just need to bring back options for people that don't want to people who do want it.new update sucks should just stick to the old one,0

"The updates are made to improve the user experience, not to make it worse than before. The feature ""end to end encryption"" -_- It is an unavoidable feature that when it enabled automatically, you cannot even disable it, and it is not even a good feature, and sometimes it forces you to delete your important conversations because of it. To be honest it's make me uncomfortable, i'm using messenger since 2013, and I think I will delete it permanently one day.",0
This app doesn't work at all not letting me in keeps on closing everytime I try to open this app. Fix as soon possible please thx.,0
"the icon reads to update...BUT when pushed, says ""UNINSTALL""",0

Please Deleted End ot end encypted,0
I find it very intrusive that you ask each user to rate their app each time after they use video chat in Messenger could you knock it off.,0

BOBO UPDATE,0
Worst updates ever pls old messenger back,0
i suggest you remove the end to end encryption because all that chat it cannot be seen anymore because of that,0
Stupid update! End to end encryption destroyed the application I have uninstalled messanger 👎👎👎,0
My experience since this new update or whatever you brilliant people back at Facebook did has been TERRIBLE (in my Charles Barkley voice) and if I could use foul language in my review there would be a few choice words to help explain and express describing my experience with your app! Your AI helper if that's what you wanna say it does told me to use messenger lite which I only found for kids but As I'm reading all these negative reviews just go back to the old app🤔,0
Need old version,0
"Not sure what ever happened but since you've added AI I can't load any memes or gifs and it always says ""can't load high resolution picture"" but every other app is fine. I've cleared my cache, reset tge app, un I stalled and reinstalled it. I'm at wits end and about to just delete fb entirely",0
I always used to report on my problem but not always always I'm very much fursted on this speaking loud loud but other can't hear me other voice is listening but other can't hear me on call this is very poor small issue lots of reported but still same still always it's being poor on service providing.,0
Most terrible and useless! experience with the sites and all they are interested in is just pushing Ads on all the sites?,0

Also-- my regular text message bubbles used to show up on the same track as fb messages, but now they are seperate which is also super annoying. Put them back the way they were.",0
I dont put reviews on applications ever but this one got my nerve to put on.I hate the recent update i dont want to put a pin on my messenger why you forcing us to put a pin to it!!!!! Dont force us give us a choice if we want to put a pin or we dont want it and dont want to download the thing you saying !!!!!!!! If your a cheater and hiding your mistress dont drag us into this do it on your own !!!! Worst app today i hope this app got erased or gone forever and they open a new better one !!!!!!,0

"Well it did work well, but then they added end-to-end encryption (that wasn't already a thing?) and decided you should have to press a button every single time you open the conversation to see and resume the conversation. Obviously that's what you want to do if you open a conversation. But apparently it's no problem to reply through notifications without hitting a button to resume the encryption, so what does the button really do apart from waste time?",0
"I had been mostly happy with the app for a while now, but this latest update sucks. Pro: I can edit sent messages now, that's nice. Cons: I still can't select sections of text, it's all or nothing; thumbs up no longer swells as you hold it; can no longer search for reaction emojis, I have to scroll the huge list and that is beyond inconvenient; the small indicator bubble at the lower right of each message is gone; sent pics are annoyingly clumped rather than in a grid. Hate these changes so much",0
"Normally this app works great. However, I've had only trouble since I got a Google Pixel 8 Pro. If I have the message bubbles allowed, nothing displays correctly and sometimes the app glitches and displays a message screen over everything that I can't dismiss unless I restart my phone. I also can't access any of the app settings from the bubble chat heads like I could on my last phone. In all, it's usable, as long as you turn off all the features that make it easy to use on the fly.",0
"Wish it would work. The messages that won't send will just read ""sending"" but if I close out the window to see if it'll get it to load, it deletes the message and still won't send when I retype it and wait. When I want to add pictures or gifs it sometimes doesn't work. The screen will just go white and never load images or gifs. Closing out and reopening doesn't work. Restarting my phone didn't either. As often as it occurs it would be a headache to uninstall and install just to send a message.",0
"I'm really disappointed that the new update for messenger removed the option to enlarge the icon reply on the right-hand side near the text box. I prefer being able to send the different/varying sizes/levels of the icon to express varying degrees of intensity of my reactions. Please fix this and bring back the size variations as soon as possible! Also, I am not at all interested in AI chat. please make an update that allows me to permanently disable the option. Thank you.",0
"So frustrated I can no longer share/attach a picure from my photo library. I get the, go to app add camera roll access, but that does not work. Tried changing that setting 3x. So now instead of a quick easy ""share"" pic option, I have to create a link to the pic, which then includes access to my entire photo library. How does this make it more secure?? Sometimes your upgrades make no sense at all. Leave my settings as is, don't assume I want these changes.",0
"Facebook messenger was a great app. Since my last update, I continuously get a notification that says ""null, you can now sign into multiple accounts,"" and I didn't change anything on my end. But after I started receiving the very annoying notifications, I've tried changing my notification settings, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and cleared the cache. Nothing seems to work.",0
"I'm not sure what's been ""fixed"" in the recent updates but the app has gone down hill. I haven't been getting messages for minutes to hours after the other person has sent them and it shows thst they were sent then and there. Also taking away the ability to enlarge the emoticon at the bottom right is crazy that was an amazing feature 😞. I hope these issues get resolved soon.",0
"I don't like that they now limit the amount of photos you can send someone to 30.. Plus, they put them all in 1 group with only the top photo showing!! You have to go through the photos like a slide show to even see the other pictures!! And if you slide down just a smidge, you have to look through all of the previous pictures before getting back to where you were in the slide show.. SERIOUSLY!! Just put that back to where it was before. There was nothing wrong with the previous system..",0
"Works great for calls and messaging, when it's willing to acknowledge that it is connected to the internet. Which is rare. Almost every time I message someone it hits me with a ""no internet connection"" error message. When I Googled the issue it said to update the app. I have the latest version of the app and there's no update available. There's nothing wrong with the internet, my phone has internet. Connects to literally everything else just fine. Meta broke FB and messenger.",0
"Does anyone from the company read these comments? I hope so. So far no one (that I can see) has mentioned the annoying way multiple sent photos are now overlapped together, instead of laid out for easy viewing/saving. I'm really frustrated about that. I can't get over how annoying that is, and harder to see what photos were sent. This just happened after the recent update. Please put the photos back to the way they were.",0
"I am so irritated with this app! Since the latest update and the end to end encryption I have had nothing but issues. Audios cut at 10 minutes, there is a delay when responding to messages, while listening to voice messages and another comes through it stops playing the current message, if listening to a message and you walk away the screen turns black and stops the message from playing. Please fix this! Equal to or greater than, not less than.",0
"there's no way to get rid on the annoying middle ""meta AI"" button. I don't use AI chat tools, I'm trying to talk to humans. Had to download a previous version to get rid of it. Don't push AI in your products. It w should be optional and removable if the person doesn't use it. It takes up space in the interface and is confusing.",0
"I lot of instability issues on android, even with newest update. I have a constant issue where my conversation bubbles don't match the chat from the main messenger, it'll tell me literally everyone on my friends list is offline, but still send and receive messages, without giving notifications, the list goes on. I'm about ready to go back to whatsapp.",0
Stupid app opens for a few seconds and then crashes. Just like other people I've had this for years and now they started that end-to-end encryption. I've updated the app and it's still crashing. There's a whole lot of better apps out there. The only reason why anyone even uses this app is because they are connected to Facebook. I've got items for sale on Marketplace I'm trying to buy vehicles off of marketplace and I can't even send a message to anybody.,0
"This app keeps getting worse. The convenience is there, but... FB Reel links are now broken. New features don't add any useful functionality. Just... stop. Please. Every update changes visuals and UI, the latest of which gives me a headache with the off balance 'leaning tower of pisa' picture layout. Emojis don't even work half the time. I've disabled auto updates and things change from one hour to the next without me changing the software level.",0
"Update:It's now 2/9/24. Now I have lost function of chat head bubbles. Every time I get a message they just disappear and will not stay on the screen. The settings are all correct. Nothing has changed on my end with the phone. App is up to date. This sucks. Even if I set as priority, or long press to manually select Show as Bubble, they constantly disappear New update is horrible. The chat heads are huge!! Takes up way too much screen space.",0
"This app is great when it works. Lately, there have been tons of issues!! Voice messages don't always play and I keep getting errors when recording voice messages then they don't send and the message is lost forever after I just took the time to record it. This feature is meant to help people save time and lately, it just helps me waste time. Please fix these repeated issues with voice messages.",0
"This app used to be my primary messaging application. However in recent months it has had issues with freezing, duplicating chat heads, only showing images in the top half of my screen, inability to crop photos (or cropping the top off when I don't want it to), and more. I even got a new phone and to be honest, it's worse. Now I keep getting notices that messenger is not compatible with this version of android. Meta is one of the biggest companies in the world. Get it together.",0
"Two stars is generous. I've been having issues with links for MONTHS. Since the most recent update (looks like 3 days), when i try to open the camera within messenger, it opens a random conversation instead of the camera. Links are still not functional. It keeps going from bad to worse. But hey, at least i don't have multiple layers of chat heads like last month i guess.",0
"Massive memory leak on Android. The app seems to have issues when it is open on screen for a long time, especially if there are multiple gifs playing. Eventually the images crawl and don't really animate anymore but slowly tick through the frames. It's the only app on my phone that does this and Facebook devs have never gotten back to me on the issue. I've reverse engineered a solution (I'm a software engineer) but again, they don't seem to care to get in touch.",0
"I've had this app for years and it usually works pretty decent. Video calls on both wifi and mobile data is pointless, you can't see or hear anything. It buffers way too much. Within the last couple years I've had to uninstall and reinstall the app due to something in it glitching. If I get a notification about a message request, I often can't see the message. Used to be a great app.",0
"Messenger is a basic messaging app which I'm sure, if you're here, you already know. Certain things though that should be simple, just have extra steps. For instance, when I take a picture from my app, portraits almost will always end up sideways. Not always. But almost always. Why? I don't know. People say EXIF corruption. Though I don't know why that would be. But I will say it is a problem and has been for like a year and a half now. Can't fix it? Give an option to not auto rotate by EXIF.",0
"Why is this new update such a drag?! I'm trying to send messages, I have full signal, NEVER sends them, and to top that, DELETES them like I never message in the first place. The new picture format is weird too, takes to long to upload (if it doesn't delete it in the first place) and you have to do extra steps to even see them and/or save them to the phone. Wth?",0
"The app has been good for years. Now it's almost unusable. Messages take forever to load, you sometimes have to restart the app multiple times to send one message. It'll take minutes for one message to send even with a strong Internet connection and a good device. Fix your app, this is actually getting ridiculous. Or better yet, work of performance over adding features nobody asked for.",0
Many consistent bugs. It won't save my drafts anymore. A paragraph will disappear if you switch apps before sending it. Awfully annoying. Also there's been a bug that doesn't raise the message box above the keyboard quite often when switching between the bubbles and the main app. A buggy mess that sends low quality images is annoying to use. Bubbles were a great innovation years ago but that's about it.,0
Ever since they started doing the end to end encryption anytime a friend sends a picture it says couldn't load high resolution image. Which is really irritating bc I use android and most of my friends use apple so messenger was a convenient way to receive pictures that wouldn't be horribly blurry for some reason. But now I'm having issues here too. It's annoying,0
"It does the basic job of sending messages ok, but if you start a message and switch over to another app, there's a chance you'll lose what you typed (this has happened several times). Also, it tends to freak out when you are a manager for a group as well, and sometimes it asks you which account you want to use then forgets where it was trying to take you. Trying to send someone a DM via Facebook tends to be a source of this behavior, where you can't actually send them a message that way.",0
"Every update just gets worse. 'No connection"" constantly, despite having data AND wifi. My call log icon just disappeared, yet FB official page still states to click the icon on the bottom of the screen for call logs, but after last update there isn't one! Nor can I find it anywhere else, so I have to scroll through messages to find when calls were made. It is beyond ridiculous!",0
"At some point overnight, I have lost the ability to see ANY ""active users"" or ""last active"" on the app only. On my laptop I can see the green dots or the little ""10m"" or ""7h"" but NOTHING on the app whatsoever. I've restarted my phone, cleared my cache, etc. I have people overseas or who work 3rd shift that I use this to gage when it would likely be okay to text or call.",0
"Had a good run, but video calls have gotten glitchy. I rely on this to talk with family who are on different operating systems than me. Also, it's back to having a constant unread message notification, which was fixed with the prior update (I've been through the whole app to find zero). Overall... meh.",0
"This app had been my go to messaging app as it seems to send better quality photos/videos between Android and Apple than a regular messaging function. However, over the last few weeks it has consistently delayed notifications from texts/calls by not just several minutes, but up to half an hour! This hugely impacts the user when they are waiting on important/urgent calls that are missed because they were never notified that someone was trying to call them!",0
"It looks nice, but it's a bit complicated honestly. I'd rather have the simplicity of messenger lite, but it's been discontinued. This app takes up way too much space for messaging. Also it rarely notifies me when a message comes in, I end up missing them by hours. Update: phonecalls don't start ringing until the literal last second when someone hangs up and I miss them. Had to test this out myself with someone else's phone. Fix your app Facebook",0
"Not sure when or why it started, but this app has developed a horrible habit of clearing messages I was in the process of drafting if I lock the phone or navigate to a different app momentarily. The preview suggests the message is saved as a draft, but there is no way to access it. This app almost always has problems, it's frustrating to constantly have to get used to one issue right after the other.",0
"Recently, I repeatedly get notifications for messages that have already been read or interacted with. Not just once in a while, but for every message and every message reaction. Other than that, it works like any other messenger app. Once the bug's fixed, I can rate it higher. But the notifications going off every 5 minutes is just too annoying.",0
"Kept having to restart the app because it won't show stuff randomly. Ex. None of my photos will load when trying to send one; doesn't show random messages and there is just a blank spot; etc. It also, always has a waiting for connection even though I have good Wi-Fi and full bars of data to back it up. This app has become so buggy that it's almost not worth using at this point.",0
"Issues with when my data works for everything else just fine, it doesn't send or receive messages, even when I've verified it doesn't have any update needed. And my phone doesn't need a system update, nor do any of my apps. So this is a bug issue with the app itself. Hell it even does it on wifi with no other apps having issues & getting fast speeds on wifi tests.",0
"It works 75% of the time. Some messages take hours to go through. Even on wi-fi. Not all Word Effects emojis that are given as options can actually be used. You cannot report a problem from a conversation, it only tries to report the person/s you are chatting with. I get multiple Chat Heads for one conversation. Avatar Effects on messages aren't the same, device to device. Some messages simply don't show up. There is just blank space. When sharing to app, it shows 2 friends, then random people.",0
"This app used to be tolerable, but still has no editing feature. They took the pinning option away. And ever since the update my app wont rotate on my phone, even with an outside app to force rotation. Also, I have issues with the encryped chats. No way to make separate channels like Dischord to organize. They focus on themes, stickers, emojis, and beautifying it. Not functionality. There's no more reasons to have it on my phone.",0
"In the last week or two I've consistently gotten repeated notifications from chats I've already read and responded to. For example, in the last hour I've gotten notifications THREE TIMES about a reaction to a message I sent 6 hours ago in a chat that has long since moved on from that topic and message. I even turned off the setting in app for repeat notifications, so there's no legitimate excuse or reason for this.",0
"I like the app and it's features as a way to keep in touch with friends and family. However, I've been having an issue lately when switching between apps. When I leave Messenger and come back, it says ""Waiting for Network,"" even though I have excellent connection. Then I can't sent or receive anything until I force close the app. What's causing this?",0
"I have been having issues with screen taps not being recognized. It says, ""Messenger is not optimized for the latest version of Android. Screen taps may be delayed or not recognized."" It only does this with Messenger. It also takes up way too much space on my phone for features that I do not use. I would very much prefer Messenger Lite, but it seems that version does not exist anymore.",0
"EDIT. I had a comment less 5 stars for quite some time. I have been experiencing consistent coding issues that hinder basic app functionality. Idk biut coding but ik it's an issue in the software. I have to audio or video call someone multiple times and hope I can hear them at the 3rd attempt. Today I've discovered that, despite having notifications with sound on, my phone makes no noise. It is noteworthy to relay that all of my other communication apps are alerting me with noise and content.",0
"Suddenly can't send msgs. I used fb messenger for like...everyone. lately I'm resorting to text messages again because the app takes forever to send messages. Or I go to send a picture and it doesn't show any pictures or it malfunctions opening the camera. My voice clips also fail to send, I may get the ""voice message sent"" text message from other person but not the actual audio. Sometimes malfunctions and shows me a blank area instead of their text bubble Idk what's going on with this thing.",0
App keep stopping and says it's constantly reconnecting to the internet even on data or Wi-Fi. Please fix this problem ASAP it's quite annoying when I need to communicate with somebody and I can't because it's constantly reconnecting to the internet. And now keeps sending multiple notifications of the same messages already read. Not new messages. And still doesn't send messages without me checking if it sent multiple times after opening and closing app.,0
Whatever they did to the app really is irritating. Usually I like to play games or watch vids while my phone is rotated horizontal. Well before the update the message looks fine and is rotated fine. This time it pulls up but have the message bubble all weird. Like it never rotated correct. It is very irritating that I can't use the app the way I like it.,0
"Ever since this app created ""end to end encrypted"" messeges, this app has been lagging. Sending photos take forever, reacting to someone's message glitches, and you can't pin messeges anymore or view them. You also can't remove the end to end encrypted messeges which is very annoying because now I have to search for a new app that dosent force me to have that option, and I really liked messenger as I have used it for 6 years. Sometimes, ""upgrading"" your app isn't good.",0
"Keypad lagging such that a word appears a few seconds after typing, when I'm already (trying to) type the next word. Go to app in settings, no updates available. Spending time troubleshooting to no avail (so far) that would be time otherwise better spent doing quite literally anything else. Once could have given 4 to 5 stars, but as of late, can't honestly give more than 2, and that's being generous. There should be quick fixes to such issues. If that were to occur, my rating would be higher.",0
"It's been doing alright but lately I keep getting this notification that it's not optimized for my phone and it crashes my entire phone. At first it was because the app needed updated but it still does it sometimes. This is a brand new phone so I know for a fact that my phone isn't the problem. Also, I don't have the ""unsend"" button anymore on certain chats for some reason which I think isn't good because what if I accidentally send the wrong messange to the wrong person? This needs fixed.",0
"Friends' profile pictures don't update on the messenger app. Notifications will not show on lock screen even though I enabled it with content in settings. Also, when I open chats, the button to automatically move to the top of the new messages is gone. Hasn't been there for like a year now. Now I have to scroll all the way up manually and usually can't find the start of the new messages. I expect more from a company who wants to dominate the market...",0
"This app was my main mode of comms for a while, but I may switch away because of how many bugs it has; nothing bubbles anymore, messages sometimes take several minutes to send, it constantly has to reconnect to the network, and it takes several days for profile pictures to update. Used to be a solid messaging app, now it's a damn slog to even attempt to use.",0
"I hate how when I click images button so I can send it to someone, I now have extra buttons to do just to send my recently pictured image to someone. Pls get the old image gallery style back, theres less buttons and searching for the album for the damn image with the old one. So far in many new updates, it feels like its getting more and more complex when the old simple was the best.",0
"My friend and I've been using the Samsung Galaxy S20FE/S22 Ultra, and we've encountered an annoying issue related to the video call functionality. When we receive a video call (even just a missed call), it is likely to keep the status ""in calling"" in the background until the messenger is terminated. This issue has affected other applications, such as alarm sounds in the Clock app. Because it is stuck in the calling state, the alarm can't ring at all",0
"This app is used to be a great app, but lately it has been downgrading than upgrading its content and features. The encryption is a good idea since it gives its user a new set of security feature, but it affects a lot of things. Like you can't see other stuff that was sent before, and the screen is always stuck with the last message you had with another person every time you open other devices. So, it took us forever to see the new messages. Aside from that, it's hard to switch accounts.",0
"It is very useful for communications, especially free long distance communication. I just wish there is an option that I could move quick reaction from bottom right to other location. I sometimes accidentally press it and it can make wrong impressionnon my part (example... it can make me agree in negative topic, etc.). Please do this so i can make it 5 stars. Updated to 2 stars... there is bug in search when in dark mode. White background with white text",0
"I regularly use Messenger to keep in touch with friends that don't use other messenging services, and have generally been happy with it. Unfortunately as of a few weeks ago, the app fails to refresh messages in my inbox and claims that I am not connected to the internet. A quick exit out and re-open refreshes my inbox but this means I have to do that every single time I want to see my new messages. It's incredibly annoying, especially with multiple chats. Reported as a bug, no fix yet.",0
The new updates feel very uncessary and the thought of older conversations being deleted is just a big NO. Important coversations like files for school and work can be badly affected by that. It's also saying I can't save photos or videos even though I have good internet connection and I still have lots of phone storage left. It's lagging way more than previous versions of the app. It takes a while for messages to send and scrolling to back read previous conversations is a hassle. Fix it.,0
"I have to delete my previous review just so I can post another review. Whenever I look at the media, it only gives me 3 pictures and after that, it won't load any pictures again. Also whenever I'm trying to scroll up to read previous and recent messages, it sends me back to the newest messages. I'm aware of the existence of these situations before but it's my first time experiencing it. But it's annoying",0
"It's good but I can't save pictures. I have good connection and have enough storage space. It's not just that, but the whole app itself. It says ""No connection"" even though I have my wifi on??? It frustrates me. Why remove the pin messages too? It's very important for a writer and artist like me writing scenarios and designs of my characters, and the pin function helped me alot to just search it instead of back read. The whole new update is disappointing...",0
"Been using this app for years now. This recent update, end to end encryption, has made the entire user experience slower and more annoying. Pictures can't be viewed with a simple tap anymore, that brings up the react emojis and context menu. You have to go to the media section if you want to zoom in on any image. Shared video links, even from Facebook, are no longer viewable within the app. And old messages can't be bumped, pinned or replied to anymore. Please stop breaking old features!",0
"What's wrong with you guys? Recently before and even after I updated the app, the messages sent to me will not appear. Usually, when we send and receive a message, it will be on top and there's a preview of the message. Now, you have to click the chats to see if your message is sent or if there is a new message sent to you. Whyyyy??? There has been problem with facebook too. Please fix.",0
"This app has been very delayed. When trying to react on a message, it would sometimes take atleast 30 seconds to process, or even when sending messages, the app would sometimes act as if I'm offline and won't send the message unless I restart the app (the sending messages would even possibly disappear after restart). It also unnecessarily turns on the end-to-end encryption to other conversations and cannot be turned off (which is bothering for the fact that the whole screen randomly flickers).",0
"Have been overall happy for some years, but now there's graphic glitches (search field goes white and unreadable), the whole encryption thing is a mess (described by other people all over the internet), and it impossible to search for people (when I search for my best friend that I write several times a week, she's no 10 or 15 on the list... And I have many more examples). It's getting downright annoying 😕",0
"This app has been helpful and fun to use, but a lot of individuals who use this app did not like the new update about the end to end encryption. I understand that it is for our privacy and safety, but I'm not happy with it, old messages are missing, and new messages are not syncing even though I've already entered my pin to sync the new messages, please remove this feature, we are content with the old one, thank you...",0
"Used to work okay. Now it 1, gives me notifications about messages I've sent to friends myself. Odd and a waste of my time. 2, Chat heads are doubling up, so I've had to disable that feature. 3, Finally, as much as security codes are a great idea in theory, does everything have to take so long to load now?! It's inconsistent too, so I never know when I won't be able to read a conversation.",0
"The latest update is so glitchy, lost some features, won't open some chats and has sent messages to the wrong people! This has been a huge step backwards for what was a great App. Luckily nothing too sensitive got sent to the wrong recipient!! Not impressed! It's still quite good for chatting, video or just voice. But please rectify these issues. I have always enjoyed using this app before, but have lost trust for it now.",0
"I really hate the issue where massive chunks of old conversations are just missing; a message from a week ago, and a couple following ones after it, then apparently the next message is one from 3 days later. Reinstalling helps a bit but is only temporary. Speaking of old messages, sometimes scrolling through old messages jumps you straight to the most recent messages, or just gets stuck on one message, with no loading circle. Major issues that ruin the point of this keeping your memories.",0
"This is perfect for me to send messages to other people but there is a problem in the app, I can't scroll down sometimes and when the app crushing, my phone will be restart and when I send a file, it's says ""ERROR THE FILE NOT SEND"" and it is annoying because I can't send docx files and other documents to my students, so please fix it. Thank you",0
"Used to love this, but it's became increasingly poor. 1stly, slow as hell, the lag is just insane sometimes. Particularly if you are clicking a replied to message to get it to scroll back up. Continuously have messages dissapearing, full blown message chains, links or photos sent, just not there like you hadn't done it, for it to randomly appear again after sometimes several restarts. This happens to a lot of people. The app is alright, its lacking in many features. But reliability most of all.",0
"Messenger offers a convenient platform for instant communication, but its frequent glitches undermine the user experience. One particularly frustrating issue is the inability to backread smoothly. I can't look back at old messages. Every time I try to scroll down, it jumps back to the new messages. It's frustrating!",0
"It's alright but one major issue. In some devices, Including mine, has a problem on the bubble chat feature. Its alright at portrait orientation but when I open the bubble chat feature at a orientation of horizontal, the chat shows a vertical view instead rather than a horizontal view which sucks. The chat is too small I can't chat. This sucks when working with landscape applications. Please fix it!",0
"I've been having serious issues with the app lately. When someone calls me, it rings maybe 60% of the time, but nothing comes up on the screen, so have to manually open the app, open any chat, click the green bar on top and only then will I see who's calling and then I can answer. Message bubbles take me to the app now, instead of just allowing me to read messages in the bubble. And I'm missing messages from people all the time because half of my messages don't generate a notification anymore.",0
"The updated messenger is so frustrating. I dont want to put on a pin in any of my messages but everytime i try to read my messages it will always pop out, and the most frustrating part is there is no SKIP and it will keep on popping out. I understand that this is a new feature but you dont have to put it popping out everytime like forcing us to put on a pin. Our messages is our choice to keep it secure. You can add the feature but it is our choice to use it.",0
"it was good before the end to end encryption update, but now alot has changed. ETEE update is good somehow but messenger should not remove the old messages to its search engine, I can't read back the old conversation because I can't search for it. the files, links sent before the update was already removed too. Also if you add on secure storage and your storage ran out, your messages older than 90 days would be deleted too, it's just way too hassle. I hope META will fix this?😭",0
"I had been able to contact my friends on messenger with no problems at all until i could not get thier icons on screen to contact them. I hadn't got a clue what had happened. I contacted my phone tech support and they couldn't work it out either. I had a screen telling me to put a 6 digit number in, but why? Eventually i put a number in and it all started working again. Facebook being involved causes enough problems. In future i hope whoever runs this site lets people know when they change it.",0
"Recent update (end to end encryption) has made everything slower, and less functional. Reels/videos/posts I receive are no longer previewed, I have to click in to see. Then, for videos, they are not full screen, are always muted and I have to hit play twice to get them to work. A 10 second reel takes me 30 seconds to open. Please fix it!",0
"I hate end-to-end encryption, I understand its purpose but it can be a major inconvenience especially when let's say your phone ends up being broken and reset and you can't open it anymore and you also have no memory of making the PIN for secure storage so you end up losing every bit of messages and numerous pics and vids you've sent. It's a major pain. It would be nice if there were a way to reset the PIN using your phone number or email.",0
"The app works well and I have used it for a couple of years, but there's a lot of unimportant features like when you are calling a friend and you turn off your phone or open another app, the audio becomes disabled. Hoping you fix this bug or remove it completely if you intentionally add it. Thank you!",0
"I'm convinced that my accounts were all hacked, or something. I keep getting notifications that I'm logged in, in different places than I actually am. I've changed passwords (lot of times it doesn't allow me to unless I do it from a forgotten password link. It doesn't sign me out.) How does one protect against psycho ex's with programs designed to hack FB accounts? I've granted FB access to my location settings and still it places me in different locations. Idk what to do.",0
"I don't think I have ever seen this app behave so badly. Seems that all went downhill after the attempt to enhance security with the PIN. Messages take forever to load and send so I end up sending them multiple times. Incoming messages also do not show in chat. I reinstalled the app 5 times because of the above and because it refused to keep notifications silent. Also, you cannot use it unless you install the updates. The benefit/annoyance ratio is getting too low. It needs fixing asap.",0
"Have not seen one person mention it, and I doubt Facebook will do anything to fix this issue. When communicating on Facebook marketplace, messenger doesn't notify when the person read the message and when they are typing. A lot of miscommunication occurs when this happens, meaning I'm not sure if they either read my messages a few minutes ago or a few hours ago. Drives me insane. Is there anyone else, or is this just on my end? If not, please Facebook as I doubt you'll take action.",0
"Like the app. But, there is a bug that really gets my day! The chat bubble (or sum), won't pop up ( I won't say the word ""sometimes"" 'cuz it really doesn't pop up anymore after months of using this app ). Hence, I don't get notified when someone chats or calls me. Fix this bug!",0
"Dear Meta, The end-to-end encrypted is INCONVENIENT. I had to un-install and re-install my messenger app for a reason. And when I installed it, all the messages of the people who encrypted their messages were all gone. I suggest, which definitely not only me suggests, that you remove the end-to-end encrypted. Bring back the old messenger. No one wants the new update. It's really hassle. There are many files been sent to be but because of the E-T-E-E I can NO LONGER VIEW them. PLEASE",0
"Poor performance on Samsung Galaxy S22 since day one and bugs / issues change around. Glitches in messages and when playing videos it exits sometimes and have to close and re open messenger. Currently, the buffer bar on the videos is gone, so I can't skip through videos, etc. Have not been able to find ways to solve these issues",0
"I've noticed a problem, the search function does not work for messages before the encryption. Maybe it is because you now decrypt them and it cannot do that for the older ones, just my thoughts, but I think it is very much worth it to fix this as older messages are where I would use the function, I see the new ones, no need to look for them by keyword.",0
"After the latest update, the photo album folder I choose is no longer the one I can select from to add photos. It shows all of my pictures from every folder regardless of the one I select. It makes it difficult to find the photo I want to share. Hopefully this is fixed in the next update.",0
"Please avoid adding something that can cause bugs, it affects our messages, some of us are having trouble of sending messages, every message we sent was always delayed, and receiving. It is not about signal, i know the difference of having a slow signal and lagging. My cellphone is new and it can't lag that quick because i didn't even install a lot lf applications.",0
"1. As of Apr 10, 2024 cannot send GIFs. Please fix this. 2. Some chats are taking FOREVER to load lately. 2. Supposedly you can choose a different notification sound for different chats with people - like one for Joe, one for Lisa, etc. But it doesn't actually use whatever you've selected, it just uses the same one for everything. Why offer a function if it doesn't actually... function?",0
"After the update, even though I have a good internet connection, the app suddenly starts to load. A sudden black screen with a ""loading"" icon starts to pop up. Notifications don't pop up also and the chats are automatically marked as read. This gives a lot of inconveniences.",0
"With this new update, I can say that this is very annoying especially when it comes to pin and other stuff in order for us to continue to use our acc. This app is very helpful in communication and other stuff especially for me as a student and someone who is using it everday. Base on what I have read and experienced, this new update is very annoying because of the ETEE because some messages dissapeared and some of it were very important too. I hope that you will not change how things they were.",0
"I've used messenger for 2 years but the app keeps on crashing everytime i scroll to see my videos that i sent to my family(Aunt, Parents, etc). The crash is just that i scroll to see videos that i sent and then after watching just a few videos, it leads me back to the bottom and when i try to scroll back up, it is frozen. That's why i gave it 2 stars.",0
"All of a sudden, I can't send videos! No matter how short, it keeps telling me my video is too long and it won't send. I have used messanger for years, but all of a sudden, I keep getting errors. This end to end encryption thing is jacking everything up.",0
"This used to be my main messaging app but ever since they switched to encrypted messaging, I can barely receive messages. Either messages disappear or I get ""waiting for this message"" error, and nothing shows up. FB, you really screwed up this time, I'm moving to other chat apps.",0
"UPDATE: Features being turned on/off without updates or notice. No more location sharing?? Meta you're useless :)) Okay when it works ... from random glitches, to receiving messages but unable to send, and the massive picture compression. The only reason I still use this app is because of it becoming the staple early on. With the next trending texting app, this is getting an uninstall. It's clearly not receiving the appropriate attention.",0
"For some reason I'm not allowed to send videos in group chats, it takes 30 minutes to send and either fails or finally goes through. I'm the only one with this problem in my group. I've tried Uninstalling both messenger and the whole Facebook app, restarting my phone, nothing works. Also not able yo listen to voice messages that are sent over messenger... again, only one with this problem. Not sure what download I have, what settings, I've googled and only fix is to un install and re install",0
"Some features are inaccessible in my Account . For some people they still have the ""notes"" feature in their account but I lost mine for such a long time now and it has been a couple of months. Also there is some problems when I open my messenger where it suddenly says ""no contacts"" and ""no messages"", not letting me even search their names on the search bar.",0
"The video call and phone call no longer work since the last update, the app keeps saying there is a bug the developer needs to fix then shuts down the whole app. This needs to be fixed as messenger video call is the way I call both my family and my partner as we live a fair distance away. Also I am getting notifications for chats but it is only what I sent someone else, which is weird, and photos and videos take ages to load, sometimes days. Please look into why this is happening. Thanks",0
Update: with this new secure thing its really stupid. Why remove features like thumbnails on links and the ability to collapse the chathead by swiping up. Also the camera thing continues to be a bug where it will be black several times before it actually turns on. Annoying. And my pin isnt even secure bc theres nothing in the chat history that needs to be secure,0
"Now listen and listen very good! Whenever a user unfriends someone, the unfriended should no longer appear on the chat list ANYMORE. Secondly, we should be able to select messages at once that we don't want anymore and delete them, instead of painstakingly deleting them ONE BY ONE! Other than that y'all are doing a fantastic job!♥",0
"Loved using Messenger app until a recent update put the ""people you may know"" at the bottom of the screen. All the time these are people I don't know. Even press ""X"" to cancel them, they reappear again. I can understand the feature being available on the Facebook app or website, but Messenger app to me is a more personalized tool for communication, like SMS texting, not for looking for random people to make friends with. Considering not using this app anymore and just have people SMS me.",0
"They got rid of making stickers bigger??? And the new AI sucks. If I could get an old version back, I would in a heartbeat.",0

"Fix this damn app. Messages are not being delivered, laggy app. No way of telling when someone was online or when they have read your messages. Notifications coming late or after a few hours. This used to be a great app and now it is just awful!! Stop with the useless designs and just make this app work again like it used to!",0
Despite allowing access and inputting the pin. Since the update came out regarding privacy across devices I'm finding it insanely frustrating to look back through history. Searching key words doesn't work anymore and I can only see recent photos in media.,0

"Like WhatsApp, it should also have a feature to show message notifications even when we are logged out of an account so that important messages are not missed. After a long time, the notification of the messenger would show that messages have arrived on the other account. While the notifications of the other account of WhatsApp would be shown immediately. Speed up the messenger as well as WhatsApp.",0

"My friend and I've been using the Samsung Galaxy S20FE/S22 Ultra, and we've encountered an annoying issue related to the video call functionality. When we receive a video call (even just a missed call), it is likely to keep the status ""in calling"" in the background until the messenger is terminated. This issue has affected other applications, such as alarm sounds in the Clock app. Because it is stuck in the calling state, the alarm can't ring at all",0
Every time I open my app it loads for a second and then kicks me back out of the app while I'm signing in. Horrible just horrible. Same with the Facebook app itself.,0

"well, the biggest thing for it, is that at least in my area, it seems to be more reliable than texting. The biggest flaw is that this app never accurately shows how many unread messages you actually have. I have to go into messenger on my desktop PC to actually discover what messages FB says I've never read (that I actually have read.) This is not a new problem. it's been going on for years.",1
"I've had a lot of issues lately that I've never had before. I can't even share a picture because it says I need to change my settings. My settings give it access to my entire cell, including videos and photos. Now I have to open Messenger and then look through my photos to send the pic. Ugh, it's also missing the edit button to edit the text I've sent. I miss the edit button, which is much easier than sending * corrections. Please fix the issues. Thanks!",1
this last update is stupid. im having errors with sending voice messages after recording them and can't play voice messages sometimes. I've had it say I have messages but there's nothing showing up even though I have high-speed internet. it will disconnect and say that I have no network/no internet when I do and I also have unlimited data so it should just switch to that but doesn't. had someone call tried to answer couldn't & still showed them as calling but won't decline or answer the call.,1
Not so sure about the recent updates. Customization for individual contacts seems to have went away without any notice. Thanks for letting me think it was my phone being crazy. The emoticon at the bottom no longer gets bigger. The app doesn't seem too stable at times. I guess we can just wait and see where this is taking us.,1
"Fun and I've won the tournament every week which tells me , I'm playing the computer! it's pretty inconsistent. the time clock getting low on my opponent will stop and not run out of time.Also I win and I never get to break. overall it's good! Has commercials but after the game and they are short. Also there is no record of your games or anything!",1
Idk what to say other than its messenger. It's 50/50 on whether or not it's going to work for the day or have an attitude. Sending gifs causes it to lag and every update it has is weird. Sometimes texts just go missing and I'm not sure why. And a lot of times it will say someone texted and when I go in. They either didn't or I just can't see the text. Notifications are that of a pigeon with a paper strapped to it as it almost never notifys me when someone texts until either an hour or few later.,1
"I swear this app gets downgraded with every update. After the last update, I no longer see thumbnail images with links to FB posts or reels. And an update or two before that, we lost the ability to see what messages correspond with a reply. It used to show the corresponding message right above a reply. Now my friends and I are left wondering what we replied to if we're not specific enough with our reply. It's so annoying. Please consider upgrading Messenger rather than downgrading 🙏",1
"Newest update makes for a worse user experience. Links don't work, if you mess up typing and accidentally add a period it automatically tries to attach a website that won't unattach automatically if you fix it, you have to manually detach it, voice messages pause if either participant starts typing or reacts or does anything at all in chat. It's like they wanted to add security but then did absolutely no testing and just launched it.",1
For some reason voice messages constantly will not play back anymore. It used to be once in awhile a message wouldn't play now it's almost every other message will not play back in the app but if I go on my PC the message will play just fine. I've tried clearing cache clearing data force stopping restarting phone no matter what it will not play the message and it's very annoying. This is on an s22 ultra Samsung if that has anything to do with operating system an app both updated to current,1
"It's been a several times that I've tried to send a voice message and I keep getting an error and doesn't send, wasting my time each time saying the same thing. And happens also when taking videos, I record it and once I'm done it just shows black and the video is gone. Fix the app, people are wasting time and missing moments because of video errors.",1
"I'm suddenly unable to send photos by selecting ""share"" because I get a notification that says I have to go to Settings and select Camera Roll under Permissions. Well that was never a problem before, but I tried it anyway, and there is no ""Camera Roll"" option. The app has Camera, Phone, and Photos and Videos all allowed, but I still get this annoying notification every time I try to do something I had no trouble doing before. Please fix this!",1
"Overall, I've not had a bad experience while using messenger, but here, over the last couple of days, my notifications are not working properly. Chat heads are working, but the only way I know I have a message is by opening my phone and seeing the chat head on my screen. I've cleared the cache, restated my phone, forced stopped messenger, turned notifications off and back on, and it still won't fix the issue. Other than that, I have no problems with the app except for the delay",1
"When it works, it's fine. BUT half the time I get multiple chat bubbles opening for the same chat, whole chunks of messages just disappearing and reappearing minutes later, notifications not bringing up chat bubbles at all, and over the last few months a pop up that says ""messenger isn't optimized for the latest version of Android and the touch screen may be delayed"". This last one occurs randomly even w/ no chats open and invariably I have to restart my entire phone just to use anything.",1
"Beta version: Was doing okay, but something in the last week or two has made it crash as much as it did several years ago. Didn't happen while I was using it this time, so I didn't lose anything, thankfully. It would normally pop back up again and work for a while when I received a new message. Didn't this time. If returning to the standard version doesn't correct this, I'll have to go back to Lite again. :( Received error message DF DEFERH 01 when I tried to report it.",1
"A semi-decent mobile version of the Facebook messaging system, sporting all the features available on the website. It would be better if it was more lightweight, though; some features like the channels and stories tabs just add more clutter than benefit. Sometimes the app freezes entirely for no visible reason, which is inconvenient.",1
"This app is ok, though there have been times part of my conversation has vanished locally and I have to find it on a different device. Since I can't seem to find an easy way to send feedback, only report problems, I'm here to make a suggestion: I would like to be able to create my own themes with background image, text bubble color gradients / masks, word effects, etc. Please add user created shareable themes!! And I'd like more (some promotional) stickers & themes for movies, games, anime, etc.",1
"Why did auto rotate for messages stop working?!! Sorry, might seem petty but I prefer it. App has been updated, uninstalled and re-installed. It works for one message after re-install then back to portrait being the only option for the keyboard --- bring back landscape!! And it is definitely a messenger thing because it works fine for everything else.",1
"Overall, this app has been incredibly solid. However, ever since upgrading to the S23, and my wife upgrading to the pixel 8, there has been nothing but delayed messages and repeated ""newly"" delivered messages that were already read. Looks like this is an ongoing problem for many. I will be switching over to a new app, unfortunately.",1
The keyboard is glitchy and misspelling everything even when you hit the correct letters. It takes forever to type a message because you have to practically retype the message because of the glitchy keyboard. Also pics take forever to send and receive. The app has slowly gotten worse instead of Better. Please fix it. It's the way I keep in touch with my friends and family,1
"Where to start? First, I absolutely LOVE Messenger and use it throughout each day but....recently, like in the past 3 month's messenger is a mess! In the middle of texting a long message all of the sudden""POOF""gone! My message's disappear all the time! Then the App stops running and shuts down, it's infuriating! The keyboard shrinks, keyboard freezes or messenger disappears! I have never had so many different problems with this App. PLEASE FIX THESE BUGS! Thank you!",1
"I am not sure what changed, but all of a sudden I am not able to type horizontally while using this app. I can use the keyboard on my phone and type horizontally while using the SMS texting app, or Google or any other application except for this one! I've uninstalled, restarted my phone and installed the app again TWICE. The keyboard works horizontally for most of the day before it stops turning and I can only use the vertical keyboard which is small to me.",1
"When this app works it is great, the other half of the time it is soooo frustrating! Half of the time the messages dont get sent. For some reason they get locked up and dont get sent. When I am trying to sell items and someone contacts me on FB, I send them a message and it never gets to the person! I loose sales! Even when I am just talking to friends through messenger, the messages get frozen and they dont get sent, Very Very Very Frustrating!",1
Works okay but often have issues with signing in and getting it not to freeze up where the auto fill options appear as a drop down list and the list won't go away unless you select one of the options and sometimes it won't work even when you select one but it won't allow you to type in the email or log in information because the list wontvgot away and keyboard won't appear. Often have to close program out them reopen it for it to work.,1
"pls. I demand the encryption to disappear. I understand the privacy and all, but it's quite annoying and unnecessary. I cannot view messages, files or even send or forward anything. it also deletes the entirety of the conversations after a week. Just keep it as always, people can find a way to protect their privacy towards this app. thank you.",1
"This used to be my fave messaging app not until I've encountered a lot of unfixed bugs. In the midst of video streaming, when a person have seen and sent a message, it stopped and glitches- freezing on screen. There are times my I am unable to send a message and receives an error prompt. This issue have been happening to my friends too with different smartphone brands. Also disappointed that I can no longer send a file format (pdf, word, txt, etc.) and .gif format images via mobile.",1
"I would prefer if you'd place a delete selection in View media, files & links. Since, it's difficult to scroll all the way back just to delete one pic. Kindly fix this problem pls. On the top there's the issue of can't crop the videos anymore. Either it would send the whole video or it would crash and can't be loaded. Then there's the issue of the read-to-read encrypted. Like, there should be an option if the user wants to put it or not. And there's other issues as well. Pls fix it.!",1
"This app was good not until the new update came. I had no choice but to put a pin because there was no ""skip"" button. I also thought that it couldn't affect any of my previous conversations but it did and it deleted some of it. It's kinda annoying because there's some messages I wanted to keep for memories but it deleted those as well. I have no other issues with the app but I hope that the new feature ""encrypted data"" will be deleted.",1
"Over the last couple of months, my rating has gone from 5 to 3, and declining. Constantly get a message that messenger is using mobile data, when I am in fact on wifi, and messages do not load properly. I have to go to the notification on my phone to go into the conversation in order to see the latest message. It does not refresh automatically. More than a little frustrating.",1
"With the updated version, there were messages I can't receive from my friends. And it would even say, ""waiting for this message. This may take a while."" I even have to sync chat history just so I can read previous messages, which some of it were missing. Too much hassle from my end really. It would highly be appreciated if you could take care of this issue. Thanks.",1
"Straight to the point, There are some features that I want to be removed/Improved, First is I want custom feature where I can either turn off the feature where I just want to say "" :)"" I get automatically an emoji ""🙂"" without any control and I ABSOLUTELY not fan and they're two different emotions!! 2nd, I couldn't see the people who are online sometimes and it happens mostly when I log in into my another acc and I literally have to reopen it. Pls fix them.",1
"The latest update is problematic. Some messages do not reflect in PC. Using it in a mobile device, I would get a sort of bug where it says that I need to wait for the message to load... but it doesn't. The View Media feature does not show the links and files while other users do not also see their sent photos anymore. I hope this would help Meta address their latest Messenger app's bugs and may the next update its previous unproblematic feats.",1
"It doesn't look good. I get that it look nice but I'm pretty sure people would like more convenient features that stylistic ones. Also, removing pinned messages is bad and unnecessary for it to be removed because a lot of people were already using it. And also not being able to go back to messages using the search feature too. It was a convenient feature, it still is but not being able to go back to the message and reply to it is just dumb too.",1
"Was a good app, but now riddle with bugs. Often, when I switch to one conversation to another, it canot load the conversation. Take a lot of time to receive a message or notification, especially those with whom I talk a lot.I can add a few random freezing and "" connection"" errors (not sure if it's the phone, however). Some bug seam to apear on my friends ios and other androids.",1
"The app is great, it has some great features and everything, but the new update dissapointed me. I can't read the old messages after updating this app and i can't reset my pin because it requires the old pin for me to be able to sync my messages and reset my pin. I'm hoping that the developers could do something to prevent further similar situations.",1
"I will only give 3 stars because I find it hard to locate the original sender of the forwarded messages I received from my friends or group chats. In order to validate the original sender of forwarded messages, I hope in the next update there is a button on the forwarded messages that if you click that, the name of the original sender will appear (time and date are also included) If the developer able to apply my recommendation to next update, I will make the 3 stars to full stars.",1
Incredibly slow picture/gallery loading speed within the app. Chats freeze and prevent you from scrolling. Closing video animations are slower that my phone's boot time. That draft message shows when the chat is closed but doesn't show when you open a chat. You could get some help from the Instagram team in that regard since you're one with them.,1
"Can you address the issue of your app? When I log in my account, it says 'null', instead of my name, for example, 'null, you can now sign into multiple accounts on one phone', 'null' is not my name. I already sent a report using the messenger app with a screenshot, I hope you'll deal with it , either if it's an error or a bug, as soon as possible. Thank you.",1
"I just reinstalled the app and theres already some problems whenever i am trying to sign in. The 1st problem is whenever I'm about to log in an account it will always say that theres an error, 2nd, When I'm successfully in the account it will say theres a error in the system, please fix this problem! Also it takes a bit longer when logging in. I hope you can fix it.",1
"I still love this app for the convenience, but there have been a lot of glitches since the last update. I have deleted it and re- installed it a couple of times I have even tried resetting my password but it still needs work. Keeps asking for a pin number in order to sync past messages. I never set up a PIN number and it will not let me bypass this.",1
"I personally would give this five stars. But the end to end encryption update was the worst. That's because I have multiple devises connected to my account, which means I can't access the messages I could send. I would suggest a feature were you can choose if you want this chat to be encrypted or not. Hopefully you would update better meta. That's all thankyou.",1
"It's an OK app ..... But, I'm having trouble with the audio options I've tested it and it's not my phone that's having the issues, my volume on my phone is fine This is a brand new phone The messenger video volume is really quiet Also if I'm getting a message I have to open the app in order to get them It has a horrible delay when recieving messages But it's better than nothing for video calling over wifi That's why it gets 3 stars for me",1
"I don't recieve notifications for messages until very late; I have to open the app and the chat to be able to see it. Many times it doesn't ring, I see just missed call or it rings after minutes, when my interlocutor doesn't use the phone anymore, so I'm answering to nobody actualy.",1
"Encryption killed the connection. Ever since they rolled out the end to end encryption recently, I get a red ""no Internet connection"" message at the top of Messenger fully 50% of the time, while my connection is perfect for everything else. Why? List view doesn't update. This new version made everything worse.",1
the bugs are just a tad bit okay now but I really do wanna request to add a feature wherein you can pin a person to the top of your messenger home. Like I have an important person I talk to everyday and all of the gcs and people I talk to are all just popping up and overshadowing that person. I know there's a search bar for a reason but this would really be a much easier and cool feature.,1
"I don't have any problems with the app but 3months ago the Note feature on my account suddenly disappeared and i cant share my thoughts nor can see other notes, when i open my other account there's no problem on it because it has a note feature until now I'm struggling to find a solution for it but I can't be fixed i guess... I kept going in the settings and report technical problems but no response...",1
"I don't understand, I kept updating my messenger and every time it updates my 2nd account only got the new features like notes and highlights but my main account doesn't have those..... Why???? End to end encryption is really confusing as well , I didn't even turned it on but guess what one of the important conversation I had with my friend suddenly got deleted, all of it😃",1
"Everything's good but the new end to end encryption system drastically replaced the old messaging feeling. I sincerely request to maintain end to end encryption system while continuing the old messaging interface like showing a blue tick, a blue filled tick & showing the mini profile picture when it is seen. Also, there's a glitch I've noticed. Suppose someone seen your message last night at 10:30 pm, which you sent at 8:30 pm, it still shows that the message was seen at 8:30 pm. Fix it please.",1
I don't know why this happened but ever since they said this app updated I can't watch videos properly. It kicks me from watching the video but the sound still goes on? It's very annoying. Pls fix it!! Every 5 second of the video it goes invisible and sometimes kicks me out of the app!,1
"it's really helpful for me to contact my relatives when we're having an occasion even though they're far away from my house, but the problem is it's really slow sometimes and when im having a video call it just stop working for a minute and then the app will close. But it is really nice so far",1
I have never had a problem with Messenger before . Until now. My notification ring isn't ringing anymore! I am a Marketplace vendor and this is posing a HUGE problem for me! I depend on the ring so I don't have to check my messages every 15 minutes or so. This is getting ridiculous. I know other people are having this problem too. On some days I might get it a few times. BUT it's not consistent. And it needs to be. It needs to be dependable every time. Please fix this as soon as possible.,1
"This app has already been a great way for me to use to communicate, however it has been proving me wrong when the recent updates had made it hard for me. The end to end encryption was so complicated, recent messages were gone because I was re installing the app and then the messages keeps loading even tho my wifi reception was good.",1
"The most annoying thing is when using marketplace on my phone, If your having a conversation on messenger about an item on marketplace there's no way to go back to the item, you have to search again to find the ad. You used to be able to do this, but for some stupid reason it was removed, just bonkers. PUT IT BACK ON THE APP",1
"It's okay, but occasionally all messages between certain times will disappear completely. Is there a fix? Edit: It seems that pictures aren't coming in when people send them to me. Is there a fix? Edit: It's happening again, pictures other people send me aren't coming in. Is this a worldwide issue? Edit: Seems that messages are late to appear when I have the app open. Is there a fix.",1
"I have had to delete/reinstall multiple times this past week in order to get messages to send. They're stuck in ""sending"" until I delete, reinstall, and then have to retype the message. Restarting my phone doesn't help this. What a bummer.",1
"The new update has made it much more inaccessible and difficult to track conversations. I use screen reader and talkback for messenger on both browser and mobile app and both have become more glitchy, the secret conversations has made it harder to find the people i need to talk to and overall the new update just makes me want to yeet my device out the window. But because messenger is the top app used for messaging in in the philippines i will still need it and continue to use it",1
"Since the newer update, I'm noticing I'm losing my older messages and pictures. I don't have the 24 hours message deletion on but I used to be able to go back and reread a message and now after so many days, 14 I've noticed, they're gone. I also don't get notified anymore with a chat head. I have to actually go into messenger to see I have a message or not. Just not very happy with this now.",1
"Suddenly I can no longer click on ANY links. I can only react to messages I receive. I can't access voice messages, etc. I've lost the ability to enjoy the pictures, messages, etc from my friends. Any ideas how I can fix this PLEASE?",1
"1. Loving the new encryption feature. But not all conversations are being encrypted. Why? 2. Those conversations which are now encrypted magically, previously sent/received messages and media aren't visible/not visible in the conversation. Please fix this ASAP. 3. Enable E2EE for group chats too.",1
"As the others said since encrypt update worse, was bit off before now crazy doesn't always send messages and doesn't show cymircke for some people it's just not good. Also has that special hiding messages only creates for more cheating and more divorces get rid of all that it's wrong period.",1
"I've been using Messenger for a long while now. This latest update needs to be fixed fast. Pictures stack on top of each other. When I go back up to read what I missed, it keeps going back down to the bottom of the page. It seems like every time it gets an update it just messes up everything.",1
"Can't send video recorded by phone's camera ('video can't be sent, you'll need to resize' but was very much able to send the same videos before the update). Can still send videos made with the Messenger app. Odd to see this, after the update.",1
Last update introduced a bug that makes your search bar the same color as your text. Come on Meta. You gotta be better than this. You cared more about end to end encryption more than you cared about making sure that your app was actually functioning properly.,1
When I got back from overseas I decided to start another Facebook account because I had all these people I had met that I wasn't going to keep in contact with. So I have used both accounts the new one 90% of the time but about 3 weeks ago it completely shut me out and now my friends r recieveing scams. My account has been hacked and I haven't got a clue what to do,1
"When I send a group of photos to someone, I can't go back and see which ones I sent, they do not open at my end. If this is a new feature then I really hate it?! How can I check I sent the correct photos?!! Is this a rubbish update or a software glitch?!!",1
"There is some kind of glitch with the quick reactions. It often gives the wrong emoji, and in most cases you can't make the emoji bigger. It only works in a couple of chat windows for me, but not the rest. Please look into it. Also, PLEASE BRING BACK THE SCREENSHOT BUTTON IN VIDEO CALLS.",1
"Good application for communication but recently the screen sharing and audio is being disabled automatically also their update isn't that good which is end to end encryption, yes its is indeed for safety but it doesn't helping us.",1
"Messages doesn't open, sometimes I have to uninstall and reinstall the app just for them to open, and then at a later time it happens again, it happens frequently to me, I hope this cam be fixed because uninstalling the messenger took out some features and cannot be seen or used anymore like the notes feature. Pls fix",1
Was just hit with the new end to end encryption feature. Not needed and no way to disable it. Creates issues with viewing messages from family & friends. We're not sharing nuclear codes on messenger. No need for the level of security being created with this feature.,1
"With March 2024's update... I received 4 photos from my son. They now appear stacked. Good! BUT when I forward those 4 stacked photos to a friend, it forwards each stack 4 times. If it were to be a group of 16 photos, they would get that group 16 times! I'm sure it's a glitch in the programming, but needs to be fixed, as I forward photos and groups of photos often.",1
"""this app is WONDERFUL"". Is that what you wanna hear you freaking morons? No it's not wonderful, every update gets shittier, slower and useless. I use this app most of the time and now that I tried to update it, it makes me mad most of the time. I thought updating it would be better but no it didn't. Try making it compatible for most of the mobile devices out there, not just for the new phones. People are conservative, we don't buy expensive luxurious phone to just keep up with society.",1
"can someone fix the UI and make it better?? Some of the features are clunky, and separate individual chats from groupchats (since it's mostly used) and have an option to remove the chat shortcut that shows the notes. I wish u guys would also put an option to leave a groupchat without announcing it to the world. I only use this app bc everyone uses it, but it might be better if you guys give us options and access to customize our chat bubbles etc like Telegram does.",1
"Since the last update, the keyboard covers the message screen instead of pushing it up, if that makes sense. I can't see what I'm typing because the bottom half of the app is covered by the keyboard instead of having moved up to allow for the keyboard. It's extremely obnoxious and hard to send messages.",1
I can say that this is kind of annoying unlike before. Now you have to click USE DATA for you to be able to see all those pictures one by one that consumes a lot of time and data. Unlike before its automatic. Hope to bring back the automatic seen pictures and video before its more better.,1
The update is really making things hard. Sending two or more photos at the same time makes every picture as an individual sent message. I can't even swipe from one picture to another.,1
Great app. However I did enjoy being able to use the messenger app as a social media and sms app at the same time on Android phones. It made it easy to send messages and texts without having to switch apps. So it's a shame that feature has been removed from the app,1
"Friends not on Facebook that sends me a request I don't receive it or if I invite they don't receive my invite. Can't txt, call, or video chat with them. I have done the update, checked my delivery, turned my phone off & back on still nothing. I need help please with messenger and being able to make contact with my friends that are NOT on Facebook. I would really appreciate any & all help from people that knows how to fix this issue. It is very frustrating to say the least. I need your help TY.",1
"I gave 3/5 becuse the 2% of the rate is not good for me.The new update of messed the End-to-end encrypt, and its not allowed to of it,my important messenges are gone by the updates.For me the update was not good.First, sometimes my messages are not sending, why?because the update aren't destiny to others. Second how can i back read? If the messages are deleted from massaeger. That's the only thing that has been in the continuity. Please fix this mess messeger, because so many people that agree",1
"Messaging isn't an issue. When people call/video call me, I don't get notified. Just after the fact, it let's me know that I missed a call that never rang. Can't pin messages anymore either, which sucks.",1
"How fricken dare messenger take away the pinned messages. It was a decent app that I used quite often, but they took my favorite feature away. I loved the pinning messages feature because it gave me a way to come back to something that would be lost in the sea of messages otherwise. I also used it to keep texts that were funny quotes and such. Now the app is just alright, but the fact that I lost all the previously pinned messages is absolutely devastating. Literally what are you doing messenger",1
"I really love this app. It's my main source of communication with family and friends. I use the voice message feature most of the time. I often have trouble getting messages from my friends to play. Sometimes I even have to restart my phone to get them to play. I used to be able to record up to 30 minutes of audio per message (and usually use every one of them), but over the last few days, it will only let me (my friends as well) record 10 minutes. I don't know why and I don't like it! 🫤",1
Really dislike this new format with the words all squished off to the sides and the gifs selection only coming halfway up the screen so the gifs are hard to see while you are choosing one to send. normally would have this app rated 4 stars...not 5 because occasionally a message sent has not arrived for anywhere from 20 hours to 3 days even though internet has been on for both sides most of that time,1
"The last updates screwed the whole messenger. It says I have no internet when I have perfect signal as well as not showing anyone active. It's been like this for months. The update literally broke messenger. Even my messages received lag, and refresh barely fixes it. It makes it nearly unusable what so ever",1
Aue what happened to this app after it'd recent update gone backwards where it gives notifications in Facebook notifications for messages. And when trying to message anyone keeps wanting me to sign into an account then doesn't load the chat window at all. These were issues they disappeared for some months and have come back again.,1
"Up until the past 3-4 months I had no issues or complaints, but things have gone downhill FAST. Messages say theyve been sent/received/read on my end, but the recipient never even gets the message. Friends often say I am showing as ""active"" when I haven't been on in hours. I have 1 friend who I had blocked a few weeks ago, but he is unable to reply after I unblocked him the very next day. He receives my messages but is not able to reply, yet he can call & facetime me. Very odd and frustrating.",1
"I always use this app as for communication. For school and stuff. Hope they put add folder where you can create a folder to separate school related communication and some other important communication stuff. Because sometimes i have to scroll way to the bottom to find a GC or a conversation. And I have a lot of GC for school stuff coz we create almost every grouping activity we do in school, having a folder to separate it would be great🥺",1
It's good over all I just can't stand the way the messages are displayed now rather than being straight across it's top to bottom (if that makes sense?) It really..REALLY bugs me and I haven't found any way to change it back tomhow it used to be. I hate it so much 😬,1
"Why did Messenger get rid of its best feature??? I've used messenger for years and I've always loved the way I could pin messages for later and save funny pictures, quotes and videos, but after the update with end-to-end encryption all my pins and the entire section in chat information is gone!! What is the reason for that?? The app has lots of bugs that drive me crazy but I dealt with it, and now they take away pins?? 4 star app knocked down to 3.",1
At last year this was a perfect app but now it has become worse... I cannot get my old messages in messenger but in Facebook I can get it. I have to reboot my phone many times I hope the meta company will solve this problem and that what is importance of end-to-end encryption. I understand that it is for safety but this doesn't work properly due to this end to end encryption my old messages are not shown. I hope that this problem will solve as soon as possible,1
As someone who uses multiple devices on the regular due to work. Its honestly very irritating to have to input a PIN everytime i need to send a message. I understand its for security. But there should be a option to enable it ONLY on new devices,1
"I am visually impaired. The new update that came out made everything that is displayed on the screen significantly smaller. I can't make it any bigger and I am struggling. If that was fixed, and if I could change the font size in the app, it would have 5 stars.",1
I would have rated 5stars if there was no changes in new update but after that end to end encryption so many things has been changed like we cannot see the photo media properly and we cannot search for old messages yes this app has made our life really easy but even though before this update it was really good and convenient yes you did that for our own safety but it came with disadvantages too like we cannot go through our old conversations I hope you guys will fix this soon thank you,1
"Update messenger, the update they just did now has bugs , you have to wait for the message to send before listening to their message , when your done sending a message most of the time you can't click play for voice at all and have to restart app in order to play and sometimes you can't even press play...",1
The newest update has some nice changes. I like the appearance changes. What sucks is the Pin feature is now gone. I can't pin anything someone sends to be able to go back to it later and all my previously saved pins cannot be pulled because the Saved Pins are gone too.,1
"Finally, messages are editable. Hope messages on group chat can be edited soon. But using Facebook lite, messages can be edit on group chats. Hm :(( And I still have problems with sending images and videos on dual app. Still says ""Error loading media"".",1
Whenever someone calls me through messenger it doesn't ring. Doesn't even show missed call notification. I have to open app to see missed calls. Even when app is open it doesn't ring?? Also lagging constantly. App works great half the time. Except for the no ringing issue.,1
There is definitely a bug I am not the only one having problems out of messenger my messages are open before I open them and also it's showing message was sent before this the boss was added to the conversation I have looked everywhere I've not been hacked I have changed my password and etc this is definitely on the messenger update,1
"Voice messaging not able to be heard on galaxy s22 ultra. Restarted the phone, force closed the app, triple checked volume, powered down the phone then back on, even un-installed and re-installed the app itself. I can't even listen to my own voice messages, but my friends can hear mine just fine?!?!",1
Pros: fast and semi-reliable Cons: the newest update to the end-to-end encryption got rid of almost a year and a half worth of sentimental messages I had pinned to look back on during hard times,1
"Suddenly audio on sent video can barely hear though full volume already. Messenger is loading compared before though my connection is good and internal storage has a lot of space. There is always a room for improvement, hopefully all the updates you're working on it will have fruitful outcome in the near future.",1
"Buggier and buggier. With the most recent 2 updates, i have given up on the in-app camera and just record everything on my phone's camera app. now videos are autoplaying, looping, and driving me insane if I have to set my phone down. Quit trying to act like Instagram, messenger, there's a reason I don't use that app either",1
Ever since Meta pushed the changed with the automatic encryption I've lost my patience with this app. I've had messages I've sent mid conversation get stuck at sending and then deleted with no message to say they failed so it looks like I'm ignoring my partner. I've lost all photos sent between us from 2019 to 2024 Jan. I miss the holding the chat emoji to make it bigger. Me and my partner have moved our chats to a different app now because if it. Do better Meta,1
"I use this app daily, and it's fine, but it's buggy... Suddenly, my drafts disappear if I have to exit the app mid message. Every time. I have to restart the app, sometimes more than once, in order to retrieve the draft.",1
With the amount of spam that Facebook allows to be sent to your messenger app They need to create A way to quicklyClick on the spam messages and be able to delete them all at 1 time rather than having to go through each one. I cannot even delete the Spam off my Spam folder because when I click on it and hold down on the Spam message it gives me only one option to declare it not Spam when it is Pam clearly,1
"Since the update, I have not been able to share anything from Facebook through messenger app. I constantly get error that reads ""this message is not available on this app version"" very frustrating.",1
"I use this app for several years now, I love the app but nowadays the link my friends send me are not opening in Facebook and but opening in messenger web but in the homepage of it. I can't see any links my friends send me. I have triend almost everything. If i turn on open links Externally then the link don't works, if I tap on it it just do nothing. I also enabled sane settings on facebook but the problem is stilk the same, so meta please help me.",1
"It's extremely irritating that the ""message"" notification number bubble shows up on the icon simply because someone looked at your dm. I'd also like to know why Messenger seemed to need to update every other day? Because of that, I had turned off auto updates (I did the same with Facebook and a number of other apps) quite some time ago. After seeing the latest reviews, I'm so glad I did! 😬",1
"Was working fine for a long time, however lately I have been having the following issues issues: -images will not load or chats will not load unless I force stop the app and try again -notifications will not clear unless I manually clear them, even if I check the app -notifications will arrive several minutes to an hour later, sometimes after I have already read the message they're notifying me about",1
"The app stopped loading. Sheesh, I hardly have any memory space on my phone. What the I give this one three stars Only. App has taken too long and did not finish to end of loading.Overall, and after all, it seems alright now. I see the messenger page now. Three stars. It's kinda too much memory stealer on your phone not really all that worth it to me to have new storage problems with no storeage space on your cell phone.",1
"Honestly, in our country, messenger app is very useful, since it's the messaging app that we've been using, most of the time in our everyday life. However, the new update mostly bothered everyone. Sad to say that the new update didn't do us any good. Please fixed this mess. Thank you so much. Hoping for your kind consideration.",1
"It used to be a good app. Until 2-3 months ago, you changed almost completely everything. Used to be able to give nicknames, edit the photos you want to send, search for pictures and videos and probably more. I don't get why you changed it because it's absolutely stupid.",1
"I don't understand this app, I've had phones where I could send any picture of video in my storage but now I can't send any pictures unless they are a specific type or I screenshot the picture I want to send then crop it before sending. There is no consitency within this app. It doesnt make sense why I cant send any picture in my phone no matter what type it is, we're in 2024 the tech is there so I just dont get the issue.",1
"I'm a huge proponent of voiced text. And all of a sudden starting 2 days ago, every time I hit the voice button for messenger, it pops up for a half a second, flashes and closes. I haven't been able to use it since the infamous outage the other day.",1
Update: that issue eventually resolved itself and now I cannot play any voice recordings that come through Messenger. 2022 - I was having pop-up problems big time. The only thing that helped after reinstalling a couple of times etc was the advice a techy friend gave me. If you have an Android go to Play store and touch update. So far it's worked for me and nothing else worked.,1
I don't get notifications that I have a video call coming in. I get notified for a message but not a call. My daughter has the same problem. We've looked high and low and did everything we could to try and rectify this to no avai.l It's a serious problem because my family talks to each other often on a family chat and they always call through and I never get the notification that a call is coming through. It's a real pain. :.(,1
"The app is great but for my old android phone that's never been updated, it lags so much and sometimes don't work. It automatically logs out my account and it'll get difficult to log ack in. I don't have a choice but to delete it and install again.",1
"This app hasn't been letting me take screenshots enshotz for months.. I've had Samsung phones for many years . And never had this problem. Every time I try to send a photo out of my gallery or my camera it says that I need to get permission for to the camera roll what the hell is a camera roll My camera has all kinds of permission they're not a button for camera roll. I lost a lot of important documents I need to save that were medical. Related. I have a Samsung s23 Plus, its just a year old.",1
WAS a great app in my opinion until this last month with latest update.. messages always going to draft and disappearing when closing and reopening the app(or tab when using on pc) and images always used to be sent to my chats super quickly but know it takes a while to load a simple picture.. I can't understand what this new update has done I think this is a downgrade to such a great app as I use this app to run my small buisness as well.. Hope this will be fixed very soon.,1
"Unable to see messages for those under the restrict messages. It says end to end encrypted . Additionally, if someone sends a message while they are restricted the status of the message is received although not seen. Previously it wont tell if the recipient got the message or not.",1
"Too helpful. Text boxes fly over each other, this obscures everything I want to do. Thls distraction prevents me from thinking about what I'm doing for real! I don't go into a app to blindly surf. I have a mission, to extract knowledge where to find something specific or communicate. I'm concerned about your security; I trust Google more. You are all capitalists but they appearbe less manipulative. They seem to be user-friendly capitalists.",1
"I am struggling with being able to FaceTime people. Any time I call, it goes through but then the other person joins and it just shows a loading screen. I've restarted my wifi, my phone and even updated all my apps. I don't know what to do.",1
"Getting a ""couldn't send"" notification with an exclamation point.When I select the exclamation point it says that I can't respond to this message. If I use end to end encryption than it's not a problem. Trying uninstalling several times and same problem.",1
We are requesting a new update with an undo button for deleted conversations and a filter to permanently delete all or specific deleted conversations. We also want a recent deleted conversation with a 30-day range before permanently deleting it. We are seeking a solution to protect ourselves from scams and have our all deleted conversations before and now available for future updates. We are stressed about Messenger deleting conversations without our permissions because of the bugs.,1
"Been having issues with messenger for like 2 weeks now. Thought maybe I needed an update? I did. Same issue. Uninstalled, reinstall, same issue! Active status and how long ago they were active is usually missing, but not always. It's happened on multiple conversations, and all those people have active status on. Please fix!!!",1
The app needs to be updated to bring a user experience that is optimized for large screen devices like foldable phones (example: Galaxy Z Fold 5) or tablets. The current user experience on a tablet is just a disappointing one that consists of the phone version of the app stretched out.,1
I love Facebook Messenger to a certain point. I get a lot of Friend's Requests from fake people and scammers all the time. I have had to block a lot of people on Facebook that l don't want to stay in contact with. Facebook Messenger is great to stay in contact with close family and close friends that l already know and trust and that is about it.,1
"Here lately half of my voice messages will not play. Someone can send me 2 in a row and only one will play. It will go thru like it's playing and nothing. I've deleted the app multiple times, restarted my phone, and checked for updates. Nothing. It's very irritating.",1
"The app doesnt let me switch to another account. (1) a popup will say i get messenger notifications for all accounts but that I have to login to see them. I hit the continue button and nothing happens. (2) i login, goes to the facebook app with account 1, but messeneger is still on account 2. Please fix this bug. No fix as of 3/14/2024.",1
"Good to talk to my friends & further away relatives but the past few months or so it doesn't always tell me when i have new messages until i open the messenger app & make it refresh itself, & then i get the notifications from those messages up to a couple hours later than i actually got the messages. Also sometimes a couple friends profile pics change back & fourth every so often by themselves, between the last 2-3 pics they used",1
I'm getting really frustrated with this app because me and my best friend like to send each other voice messages since we can't talk on the phone often and for some reason it keeps saying there is in error when I send one. I can get hers she just can't send mine. And can't listen them either once its sent its completely lost.,1
"This works for so many options. So advanced, yet so behind. Why didn't this have an auto translate feature like telegram? I don't want to waste time copying and pasting individual conversations to Google translate or screen images as well. Annoying. Please add an auto translate feature.",1
"There's an issue with your app that whenever you send a GIF or a picture, the keyboard blocks the texting bubble. Making it hard to see what it is you're typing. This issue needs fixing. I shouldn't have to close and open the app back up in order to see what I'm typing.",1
"Great when it works.. I use this as my main form of contact between my husband and I and also use it to communicate with parents of the kids I teach. Lately, videos won't play.. messages don't go through.. or people miss entire conversations. I've un-installed and re-installed . So idk what to do at this point",1
"This is third or 4 th time recently I've had to uninstall and re install app, either no pics or can't see the messages, please try fix this problem please. Change the End to end encryption options aswell, we should get an option to turn it off if not wanted. Big update reqd",1
"Frustrating I like this app and use it everyday, but recently if I want to see the animation of a sticker before I send it I can't. I used to press and hold to see what the animation does, now it just asked if I want to favorite it or send it. 😑 I wish they would just be animated as you scroll through them.",1
"I can't share my gallery photos to messenger. Something about permission and a camera roll. I've gone through every permission four times. What's going on? I spend over a thousand for a phone with a supposedly great camera, and I can't share photos to messenger? I should have kept my S10! I'd find another app if I knew of one. I live 3000 miles from my family. Messenger was the main way we shared pictures. Please, please fix this now!!!! Help!!!!!",1
"Great app, almost everyone have this. My only problems are the updates, I know there was an update that you can edit your own messages but sometimes I have that option and then it disappears. I am quite sad about this, please fix it.",1
"I've experienced this one bug or glitched I think lately when I restrict someone and go to the restricted accounts then tap that person's account then I can't see the messages or anything, all I can see is that end-ti-end encrypted chat thing when I didn't tried that one yet,pls fixed this one thank you",1
"Works mostly good except for quite some time when sending videos they upload in unwatchable quality, below HD on my device. A 4K video is getting compressed to 368x640. Very unfortunate because this was previously one of the best alternatives to message between Android and iPhone users.",1
"It works well as a quick option to message a mate but I explored my chats in archives,market place and super old dead chats. To delete any one them you must individually select and delete, should be able to delete multiple at once.",1
"It keeps sending duplicate messages, with both phones, so it is not the phone, I tried unistallimg & reinstalling/ clear cache, no luck. The duplicate message doesn't always go to the person the original massage was intended for . Not good.",1
"It's a good app . But here is something I want to tell you . That is messenger have been customized many beautiful occasions and designs like Lunar Calendar. But It is a great sorrow that messenger haven't The Customize Of International Mother Language Day . This day has also a Great meaning. If you use this for our customized it will be better because it helps us to give honour all language and all nations . So, if you can customized International Mother Language Day it will be better.",1
"Cool app and works pretty well. It has a lot of cool features and is easy to use. Although it would be better if I could use it offline and still be able to send messages, but other than that it's an amazing app that I bet anyone would enjoy",1
"It's is good app but suddenly it's starts to disappoint us like sometimes we can't search the old messages, sometime my messages couldn't send when I came again then it send, sometime all the messages get disappeared and now I can't see the ""seen time"" if the person seen my message after one hour then the messenger shows me that the person seen my msg exact on that time when I send the msg like how man???",1
"Since Saturday, 6/26/21, all my stickers have become ghosted (I don't have that many). Right before they ghosted. If I tried to use a sticker, the chat screen disappeared, and the stickers became huge. On the main chat window, the sticker icons became extremely small. Also, the stickers keep moving",1
"Make this app compatible with Samsung A53 5G current Android version, sometimes a system message pops up and said the app isnt compatible with the current android version on my Samsung A53 5g phone here and if I dont force the app to stop, the app will just keep my phone frozen, including my ability to press to get to different apps and the keyboard.",1
Not bad but sometimes when I use sticker when the video call is going on the app hang too much and some time I can not forward or sent massage more than 1 person. When I use GIF in chat it's hang so much besides this problem every thing is alright I'm giving my feedback hope it can be fix,1
"the end-to-end encryption is not helping at all. it deletes itself save messenges, links and media and cost a lot of stress. why updating without testing it your own accounts if its helping.",1
"For some reason for the last few days it shows that I have unread messages but I do not see any. Cleared cashe a multiple times , reinstalled the app multiple times and still the issue persists. Please fix this ASAP if possible.",1
"Ever since the update, messenger has been annoying. There were a lot of bugs, loading screens just kept on blocking messages, messages not aligned properly, continuously messaging bugs. It's really annoying. I hope it gets fixed.",1
"Please remove end-to-end encryption or at least make it a feature that we can toggle in each conversation. This feature just pops up one day and my experience with the app has got significantly worse ever since. Also, please consider fixing sticker pack thumbnails, as there is a bug where they just randomly won't display. Cleaning all app data or reinstalling the app may fixx the bug, but after a few days, it comes back.",1
"Loading of messages are slow if I open messenger. It is 5:00PM now but the messages are still at 4:10 - 4:30PM (which is the time when I close the messenger app. It takes a lot of time to load if I open it again. Laggy Chatheads. When a chathead pops up, if I click it, it is lagging. It is working smoothly before but what now? Laggy group chats. I have a lot of gc where the members are over 50 users. When I send a message, it is lagging. It is working smoothly before but what now?",1
Why now is it I can get messages from Messenger but if I send 1 back it just says sending without going through. I've uninstalled it then reinstalled it and still doesn't work!! This is the first time I've had any problems WTH!!,1
Update: Saw an update here on google play but the bubble functionality is still there please revert it to chathead. The bubble feature is disrupting all of the things that I usually do that is not being disrupted before.,1
Recent update isn't good. When I select my the photo album to send pics it shows different random pictures in my phone instead of showing the pictures specifically in the album I've selected.,1
Used to be working really well but since the last update that includes encryption and AI some messages don't come in... either I miss plenty or there's a box telling me a message was sent and it might take some time before I get it...really?? Why did they need Messenger encrypted when they have WhatsApp who does the job well??,1
"A need to change the font colour when searching for someone is necessary when on dark more. It's like white font on a white background, which is very hard to navigate.",1
"It's a good app, but it needs more development. Nowadays, I face a problem that every time I open the app, it asks me to set a pin code in order to work. I don't want to add a pin code. I tried to clear the cash and data of the app, but the problem keeps appearing. Please solve it.",1
"Fix your app!!! Calls won't go through even when it rings and shows that it's going through, but still doesn't connect. Not an Internet issue either.",1
"My messenger is glitchy AF. even though I received a new message that specific chat threads is not highlighted. And the chats doesn't seem to be in a chronological order like when I chat my messages seem to stack in a single space. Yes, please fix that",1
I hope theres an improvement to your apps specially when it comes to view image always need to click use data very hassle most of the time the image cannot view immediately.,1
"Been using this app for a really long time and it's pretty good 👍 The new thing they did with the pictures though, how they're displayed, and the fact that all the pictures get jumbled out of order and stuff? Awful.",1
I have no problems with it but the end to end encryption made our conversation lose some photos and cannot be easily find and and the terrible part is it made some of our conversation very laggy and some photo's keep getting unshowed or cannot be seen I hope this gets fixed.,1
"recent update has made my messenger flicker since the last update, every action of the recipient made my screen flicker. it has become unusable. fix it immediately. i managed to fix it after reinstalling the app.",1
It frequently crashes and won't run if any other app is running. But it gets points otherwise for being pretty customizable in chat screens and easy to navigate,1
"Not a fan of the direction the app UI is headed... It doesn't need to look like Instagram chat, but it does... Some of the iconic features are removed... And the animation is getting glitchy.....",1
Please optimize your app cause my iPhone 7 can run your app better than my Galaxy S10+ which is very weird. The stuttering when chatting someone with sent or received photos or GIFs almost makes it unusable. Please fix this and Thank you!,1
The last two updates are screwing with videos & photos. When I click to play it goes nowhere on videos then puts a black picture on the previous video picture. With photos when I click on the to enlarge it download it only brings up the emoticon bar. Very frustrating,1

"Many people gave this app a bad ratings (1 star), but base on my own experience, i think the suitable star for it is 3 atleast. So the problem which you should consider to fix is the quality of the video, whenever i tried to send someone a 1080 hd video , it turned out to be blurred when it is already sent. Also the vc button, which i always accidentally tap, it shouldn't be put in there. and the fail messages, Sometimes it takes a few seconds to minutes before my message is being sent:>",1
"Sucks since update! Doesn't show who's online like it used to and has a stupid AI thing most people won't ever use, now it's just the ones at top that show online u have to scroll sideways and I don't think it's even all the people online and like others have mentioned harder to send pics now since it clumps them together",1
"Get rid of the Call(Video) button for every conversations from the front page and instead add something like an arrow like this ""<"" that when clicked the Call(Video) would show back again. Why is this neccesary? Because of unintentionally or accidentally clicking either both. Example of this is when your fingers are sweaty that causes the screen to malfunction or when you thought your phone is turned off when in reality it actually isn't.",1
"It's fun to chat with someone but there's some sort of a problem 1.) When I was gonna send a picture, its loading forever and I don't know if I can never send a picture 2.) When I click the app, I seen the previous conversation without new conversation",1
Its very easy & advance presentation it automatically understand the users requirement and provide services according ly only draw back is it need to be understand developers that data and privacy also stability once installed used need to be stay forever i strongly suggest thar even any one loved out due to any app you please carry on because you are messenger service provider to ussers not to app like facebook and other with this feature the mane masenger and his work mamrable i know this se,1
I have been using Messenger for years and it did everything I wanted. I always used it in landscape although I could use it in portrait if I wanted to. However lately I can only use it in portrait. It won't stay in landscape for more than half a second. Obviously an update has not been tested properly before being implemented. Please fix this fault.,1
"The experience is great, I haven't really experienced alot of bug, glitches, problems, or just annoying pesters at all, except one little thing (which I don't know if it's from my device or genuinely the app because on my previous cellphone it wasn't like this.) Everytime I'm not using the chatheads and go back to the app to reactivate them again, it doesn't have the button and it doesn't appear EVER even when a day passes, I restart my phone, or reload the app, it only gets fixed reinstalled.",1
I always access Messenger through my Facebook account. This week when I go into Messenger I can't get back into Facebook. Using the back button just takes me to my phone's homepage. Using the Facebook icon takes me right back to Messenger. ***To actually get into Facebook again I have to restart my phone every time I have visited Messenger to read a message. This is stupid! Why? How can this be fixed?,1
"When the chat bubble is square with rounded corners, the user profile picture is round with a gray or black background around it. Please fix it because it looks bad. This bug wasn't present in the earlier version of messenger. The second bug is information that someone viewed message on exact time when it was send when I left the app and back for example 10 minutes later. I checked for example 1 minute after message is send and it is not seen by them. Hope it is understandable",1
"Dislike the new encrypted messenger stuff they've introduced. Now I dont get notified when I have new chats coming in and its taking way longer for any messages, or pics, gifs, etc, therein to open. Get rid of it.",1
Ever since having meta on it I can't even see the people that are online anymore. I don't typically message people unless they're online unless it's absolutely necessary. Now where I would like to see people originally there's a meta icon,1
"Idk what is going but since the last update it doesn't show my messages U less I go in the app itself. I have restarted my phone and my internet thinking they were just glitching. I have uninstalled and reinstalled messenger twice and it's still happening. I get the notification, but if i use the chat head it doesn't update the message nor does the app ever show anyone on. I literally have to go to people and wait a few seconds than go back to chat before I see anyone actually on",1
"I can't find the data saver option. I need to turn it off because even when I'm connected to my wifi my media files won't show automatically and it's so annoying to click ""download"" everytime",1
"Hi this app has been good so far but recently it has been full of errors, it kept on logging out every 3 minutes or so, and does'nt allow pe to copy and paste because the app closes, can you try to fix it as sson as possible please? thank you",1
"Regularly use this app but I haven't been able to receive notifications so I have to open the app everytime. Did basic troubleshooting, turned on notif for the app, updated the app itself, restarted my device a lot of times and still not working.",1
"How does it get worse with every update? Slow, unresponsive. GIFs are now broken, pics and videos take forever to send(or completely fail to send constantly)",1
I'm currently experiencing a log whenever I send messages to my friend it's always slow and some of my messages are not sending and it always took 3 try to send hope this will be fixed,1
"I don't have enough room to download the Messenger update and I knew nothing about this until I was messaged by a few contacts that I wanted to communicate with. This is unfair as I have a cheaper phone, so less room. The warning could have come before this I presume. And now I made room and still can't seem to update messenger. My facebook contacts are going to think I took myself off or something else. It's unfair that I can't communicate with my friends and family on facebook due to this.",1
"Can you guys fix your app please?? After the last bloody update the ""waiting for this message"" thing is seriously aggravating. Some of my messages disappear after sending so I have to send the same thing 3 bloody times, and half of them are ""waiting"", both sending and receiving. I cant even tell if everything sent is even being sent and received. Never seen it be this unreliable of an app. Thank you in advance.",1
Okh..so i have been using this sines 2021.... Its a very good app...i like it.. Now there is some update in this app i didn’t like.... For example before there is a setting for changing the active status Colour bt now its not there.. Also i noticed that if i block someone and unblock after a while...than i can't black him/her again if shows i have to wait 48 hours to Again block him/her...i am requesting that plz change this Setting.. Its so annoying,1
"Its very nice game,fresh mind very fantastic game someti es easy sometimes hard, its use mind how to choose nice move and gôid decision.sometimes easy to play with friend s or self.sometimes need more practice and try it again and again,and try my friend how to learn this game how to beat in higher score with others,accept challenges to other,its very nice game if you want to enjoy this game and for relaxition you try it this games,its so very nice game .. So what are you waiting for!!Please tnx",1
How does one stop this app from adding URL suggestions when one is typing? It's tedious and annoying and if one doesn't delete the URL suggestion it gets sent with the message causing much confusion for the recipient.,1
"Was a great app. Now since the latest update I can't send videos to my family. It's very upsetting because most of my family use fb messenger as their only way of instant messaging. How can we continue to keep up with each other if messenger won't allow us to send photos, videos ect....",1
I don't know what's up. But on my Galaxy Tab 8 and S23 - none of the gifs I send out work. They just post in chat as compressed images and never play. Not the end of the world but I like having gif wars and now I gotta use words like some kind of worderer.,1
"Since having to reinstall my app, my whole chat history disappeared yet still visible through accessing through messenger...but I can't reply only view. When going to reply, messenger reverts back to the app where the history is still gone. Shared photos and files are also gone from the same point.",1
"Average, but didn't have to be. First mostly well, but the thumbs up and text to chat should not be side by side. All too often hit the thumbs up when I'm trying to do voice text.",1
"Why on earth do we need to add a pin to access chats when we have been able to access them with our normal login, from any device? Making things less convenient with lower functionality is certainly an interesting approach.",1
"Its a great messaging app, however the recent update made it that messenger could automatically end-to-end-encryption any messages and conversations. It completely ruined my view of the app.",1
"I do not like feeling like I've been ""violated"", when there's updates available and my app ""won't work"" until I do update my Messenger. WHY NOT LET ME DECIDE IF I WANT THE UPDATES OR NOT and leave it at that? It makes me wonder what's NOT being told. It's nice being connected to friends and family, in this way, but sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.",1
"When you first installed it the emotions are so realistic but when you delete it and installed them again it's not the same as it was, idk how to fix this cuz i repeat it to delete n install but its not comming backkkk lng as it was!!!!",1
"This is the first app I used for chatting. It was good.Actually better than good.But now,there are various types of restrictions on text. When I text simple words it(the app) finds it in a negative meaning and the text isn’t sent. Rather it is being retricted. I'm getting quite a lot disappointed because of it. Please fix this stupid bug. I feel quite uncomfortable while messaging.",1

I Uninstalled it & will reinstall & see if that helps...... nope, it didn't. 4/24 Glitches are no longer present",1

Used to be working really well but since the last update that includes encryption and AI some messages don't come in... either I miss plenty or there's a box telling me a message was sent and it might take some time before I get it...really?? Why did they need Messenger encrypted when they have WhatsApp who does the job well??,1

"I personally would give this five stars. But the end to end encryption update was the worst. That's because I have multiple devises connected to my account, which means I can't access the messages I could send. I would suggest a feature were you can choose if you want this chat to be encrypted or not. Hopefully you would update better meta. That's all thankyou.",1

Ugh fu*kbook messenger what's to say.... If it were a human it would be a dope dealing cheating homewrecker that has a ferociously bad habit of gossiping anyone and everyones personal business it can get it's ears privy to. 🤥😍🤫🔮 👙🍆🍯🍑 🍺🚬🪴🧪 ♂️♀️🚺🚹 🎤🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️📢 🎆🧨🎇 😭😢😿🎭 🖤💔❤️‍🔥🖤,1
I'm not sure how to navigate the correct version,1
Im part of a gc my friend even sent me a photo but for some reoson whene i search the gc name our old gc is the that pops up its still usefull tho but pls fix this,1
"Overall the app is great. However, I noticed a change when it comes to missed calls. The message used to be so and so missed your call. Now it just displays as missed call with a person's picture next to the message. The change makes sense to me but for older people like my mother who uses messenger they don't understand if they missed a call from a person or if that person missed their call. Also the picture indicating that you missed a person's call is so small that it goes unnoticed.",2
"Messenger is generally very useful for keeping in touch with people. i appreciate the fact that you don't need a Facebook account to use it! However, within the past couple months, nothing will upload to my story. I keep getting the red bar saying ""Message failed. Click to try again"". Nothing happens when I click. I love the story feature and would love for this issue to be resolved.",2
"App does what it needs to do as a messaging program. Fast, responsive, and sports the vast majority of the desired features. The reason for four stars instead of five is because the application interferes with applications running in the foreground when replying to messages via the notification bar. The Facebook Messenger app appears to come into full focus, stay invisible to send the message, and then exit. This pauses DRM protected content and sends video to PiP. Thanks for adding split view!",2
"I like messagener, it's just not always reliable. I use it is cause It is easy to find and text/call your Facebook friends and contacts in your phone. But some dropped calls, bad video calls, even when myself and the other person has good signal. But most of the time it's good. What I dislike the most is that when the app goes to update, it just does it. If you're in a call it just hangs up the call, and I have no way to let them know why they can't get back in touch with me until it's done.",2
"Works good. Stupid me just discovered that you can use it like a walkie talkie with the microphone icon. It would be quite handy if there was a widget for that little icon and a widget for most frequent contact. This would be great for work or when youre in a spot where you can't stop to text. Voice is much fast and you can actually hear sarcasm, anger, or confusion in a voice rather than in a simple text. Please, make this happen, soon.",2
"Runs well for the most part. My only complaint is that I will constantly see message threads that are marked as unread, despite the fact that I have indeed read all messages. And every time I try to once again mark them as read, they will become listed as unread within (typically) a matter of minutes. I have tried various different things to stop this from happening (restarting phone, force-stopping app, uninstall & reinstall, etc.), all to no success",2
"Slow, Slow, and Very Slow. Lately, the app doesn't even fully load on WiFi nor data. Takes forever to send photos and receive photos. Not sure what happened, but I don't like it. Edit: I bumped up the review to 4 stars because it's working like it was before, but I didn't give it 5 stars because sometimes I don't receive notifications for new messages.",2
"For the last week or so, EVERY TIME I open messenger and an annoying pop-up at the bottom opens on top of it asking me to select an account... when I try to click on anything or outside of the box, it comes RIGHT back up! Over and over and over ! I have re-installed and uninstalled, restarted, and updated, and nothing. It is extremely annoying, and I just read a few others reviews noting the exact same problem. Please fix this! ~Sincerely annoyed user.",2
"Messenger's reliability beats all other free messaging/calling services hands down. I'm not particularly fond of callers being notified if you've chosen to decline their calls. I also don't like that my time online must be made known in order to see my contacts that are currently online. I don't mind being seen online, but the exact amount of time is pushing it a little too far, in my opinion. Still better than the rest, though!",2
"It does the job, does what it says is supposed to do I guess. Only gave it 4 stars because I feel like they could have many many more customizable options, things like the chat themes/colors, ring tones and notification sound and what not. Really wish they would develope a bunch more themes to choose from in the chat options, I'd like to have a different theme for each friend. I mean a little more then just a solid color, like the monochromatic one is cool, more of those kind of options I need!!",2
"Honestly in all its a good app, not the best quality for Video chat, but thats my Wi-Fi. It has nice themes, and I like the vanish mode a lot so you can be private. It shows good amount of support for connecting with family and friends. I enjoy it a lot. But one thing I do NOT like is the lag sometimes. Other then that, it's completely great!",2
"The messenger app has improved greatly with some of the more recent updates. It appears to run faster, with less buffering and crashing. The one thing I don't enjoy is the new tie-in with the Facebook app. Now you can't use messenger in the FB app, when you click on the messages icon, it automatically opens its app. This is inconvenient for me as I don't have a lot of memory to spare.",2
"For the most part, I find this to be a very useful app for staying in touch with friends and family. I expecially love being able to video chat with family halfway around the world. I consider this the app's best feature. The only thing I dislike is the lack of support for Bluetooth keyboards. As soon as I type the 1st character, the input box loses focus and stops accepting characters. Amusingly, this works perfectly in the main Facebook app. Please fix this.",2
"I enjoy using this app. I wish that there was an option to expand the size of the typing/editing window up to 80 percent when composing your message, because I am an avid proofreader and have still sent my message with unseen errors by mistake. I also would like a 10 second option to edit the message, even after it has been sent. The ability to use underline, italics, bold, and different color text would be fantastic. Add many of the common word processing tools that we're accustomed to.",2
"Something has been up with the app recently, it's not wanting to work or load properly, when someone sends me voice clips, it will show a message saying ""sent a voicemail"" but it wont let me play it! It's annoying and I have to end up asking the person to send it again. Also messages have not been wanting to send through properly, it all started after it's recent update, please fix this.",2
"Like the app, but since the last update, when I send a message it shows it twice. Why the irritating duplicate message? Also, now when sending photos, the photos often change to a zoomed in top left quarter of the actual photograph. It doesn't do this every time, but appears to do so randomly for no known reason. Would be nice if the glitches were fixed. Even nicer if they were fixed before rolling out the update.",2
"Normally this app is pretty standard and no issues, but it has a lot of kinks when using it with the Microsoft surface duo. Sometimes it will only work with both sides ""open"", the interface of this app currently doesn't work well when it is on both sides, and needs a lot of tweaks when it comes to the Duo. Also, I think the mobile messenger app should have the option to send a picture and text in the same message instead of two separate ones.",2
I don't know why but for the past month or so every time I send someone a video it disappears on its own as if I never sent anything in the first place even though it gives me the check mark that it has been sent. I checked the shared photos/videos album but there's nothing there either. The video stays visible for like an hour or two and then it disappears. Please fix this bug if possible!! Thank you.,2
"i love this app and everything that comes with it, videos are clear and you can hear voices. but the reason for four stars? The way to send images. Why'd ya change it? its harder to send pictures now because you were able to pick a specific catagory you wanted and have no problems sending pictures from forever ago. but now you can't do that, and it just...sucks. sometimes upgrades are good, other times..not so much. and in those situations its best to leave it the way it is or was",2
"This app is the only app available for texting. It auto corrects without prompting and can often change words, thereby changing the message after proofreading is completed. It can auto correct the same words that have already been changed. There is no way to edit a message after it has been sent so you often don't see it because you proofed it prior to sending not realizing it reverted back to its own understanding as it is sent. If time is a factor it isnt always possible to double check.",2
"With the last update, you can't mute the sounds, it's overriding the volume controls. I had every volume category muted and still getting loud beeps and bongs and whatever else noise it makes. That's ridiculous. You can completely stop all notifications to get it to shut up, but then you don't get anything, not even vibrations. Update: They fixed the sound issue not too long after my review.",2
"I've always used the messenger app and almost prefer it over text except now ALL of my chat colors, FOR EVERYONE, have gone back to the original boring old blue! It didn't even do this to everyone either 🤷🏼‍♀️. A friend sent me a screen shot from our convo and her's are still pink on her end. Don't fix it if it isn't broke! It's simple, keep what works! I know you all have algorithms and such that show you how much a feature is being used.. Bring it back please! Sincerely, Very Disappointed",2
"I use Messenger every day and often. At some point recently, the ability to select an album from which to find+send a picture was removed. I can't imagine why it would be removed, so I'm hoping it was by mistake and will be fixed. It is impractical (putting it lightly) to scan through thousands (literally) of pictures to locate the intended picture. This is my first review and felt compelled to post in hopes of bringing attention to this issue. I suffer from this change on a multi-daily basis.",2
"Great for most part, but I do have a few negative things to say. I don't like how it rings when someone is calling and when u answer, it starts ringing as if u were calling them! When I don't have signal to send an outgoing message,it just doesn't send, even 8f I get signal again. I'd prefer it to go thru when my signal is strong enough to do so, not have to manually choose to try and resend again. And I wish you could schedule times to send a message.",2
"Love being able to IM people. However, lately, every time I go into the app, it says ""waiting for network."" It doesn't matter if I'm on wifi or data, at home or out of town. I have restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and Googled an answer. Nothing works. I have never had this problem. It fixes itself after awhile, but then it just happens again. What can I do to permanently fix it??",2
"This messaging app is wonderful! I like how you can set themes on friend's text, it's good so far. Facetime chages alot from what I can remember, but you guys have to fix text search. For that reason, everytime I go back to my text from history it loads up ""try again later,"" ""went somthing wrong"" and when I search the word it takes a very slow progress to upload the pass text. So Asking you to please fix this.",2
I find the app very useful but there's a huge bug to be fixed. I have an android and the issue is with the bubbles interfering with other apps working properly once the bubble has popped up while using the keyboard in the other apps. A message about the app not being optimized for Android pops up. Then I have to restart my phone because I can no longer navigate my other apps due to freezing up. Please fix this.,2
"Edit: Below issue is now resolved. App is fine, stickers could be better, but its ubiquitous and they've made it easier to use without having a FB account so chances are your friends are gonna be able to use it. ------ Feature to change nicknames and colors in chats was removed and was the main reason I used it. Support has not gotten back whatsoever. will change review when issue is fixed.",2
"Extra contacts show up in the list of names I am looking through, ( as a row of circles with names ), and it throws off my chain of thought. Not good.{ Maybe you could place that role of people at the very top, or something else } Need an OFF switch for that, please; and one for that horizontal/vertical switch, too, ( at the bottom right-hand corner that I touch all the ¶¥√[\!#* time). I want a volume lock, that I have to turn a switch to enable/disable the ability to turn volume up or down.",2
"Free app, allows me to view Facebook profiles without actually dealing with the app. It works quickly on my phone and allows for dark or light mode, many mute options, and large files. It never crashes anymore and notifications are always reliable. Feedback: The only thing I don't like is having to scroll through photo history to find a video. Please add a section where I can view the videos sent and received in a conversation that's separate from photos and I will see this as being perfect.",2
"everything works as should. except when on Bluetooth. not sure if its with my phone only but anytime i have my Bluetooth headphones on , or im driving, whenever i get a call, it doesn't work with Bluetooth even after selecting the option to switch to a Bluetooth call. Its a bit dangerous to try and switch over if im driving, and even though its not a big deal while im wearing my headphones, it can get a bit annoying.",2
"it works well for everything its supposed to do, but a feature that was very helpful was removed. You no longer have the option to chose photos from your gallery folders (ie. downloaded photos being in a seperate folder than say camera photos and screenshots). It makes it very inconvenient if you want to send a picture that is not new and at the top of the camera roll because if the photo is old you need to scroll through tons of photos merged into one folder to find just one specific one.",2
"I really enjoy this app mainly for texting my friends on Facebook, but for some reason, when you open the Messenger app, on the top left corner, it says ""Create a Room"" for video chats, but it doesn't show where I can add to my Facebook story. It used to show that feature, now it doesn't anymore. I don't know why...Now, I have to open the Facebook app itself and add my stories. Please add the Messenger story feature back and replace the video chat room somewhere else. Thank you.",2
"A convenient app to go with FB. It's almost indispensable. I have used it for years even though it drives me nuts. My issues and why I can't give it 5 stars 🌟 : 1 - It's a very large app and uses a lot of your storage. 2 - Low end phones (Obama) often can't handle it. 3 - A good WiFi connection is always needed or it becomes unresponsive and freezes. 4 - Messenger Lite will take care of these issues, but most of the app is missing (photos etc) and why bother.",2
"The only real problems I have with the messenger is that sometimes it refuses to send the message. And every so often it will kick me out of a video conversation, like the signal can be perfect and clear, then you get the echo effect. After that the cameras randomly stop mid sentence and freeze up. But every product has its imperfections. That's why the developers are always on top of the problems. Though is the only update I have ever had on Messenger.",2
"Normally a good app. I use it everyday, but since the last update, if im not the last one to say something in chat my notification wont go away. It also keeps doing the notification sound every. single. time. i touch a chat head, and the chat heads arent popping up automatically. (and yes I checked my settings to make sure it's still set to do that) This is really starting to get annoying.",2
"Honestly a very solid, robust app, despite my reservations about being too invested in the Facebook platform. Chat heads are a great addition. However, I miss being able to make a shortcut to chats on my homescreen. I'm on a OnePlus 6t, and I lost the feature right around the time I switch. Idk if that was my phone or the developers that killed it, but I'd love to get that back.",2
"Ever since the last update, I no longer have the ability to send photos within a conversation. I have to go to the home screen to upload a photo and then choose who to send it to. Please change it back. This is super cumbersome. There are plenty of free tutorials on UX across the web since you apparently have lost your mind in this regard. Update: it's better now! Thank you!",2
"I like the app well enough there are a few fixes needed but others have already given those out. I would love to see an option for being able to type a message and send it out at a later time and date. I have friends in different time zones and it would be nice to not disturb them while they are getting some sleep. Would be nice to have a send later both time and date option. Thanks 🌹💃 It would be nice to be able to change font size and color, still waiting on the send text later option 😢☺️",2
App is great tho. Switching accounts really sucks. Everytime i switch accounts it glitches and has trouble switching accounts. It goes on the loading spiral of death. I have to close the app completely and try again and log in. I have tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling. I have also updated the app every time. Still goes on the loading spiral of death. Thanks for reading this. Hopefully it gets fixed.,2
"Unable to access chat heads now with this recent update, so I'm unable to message people while I have other apps open. Such a needless removal. Bring back the chat heads option! We shouldn't have to switch back to the app every 10 seconds just to message someone back 😑 Update: So I just found out about the Bubble option. Kinda dumb I had to go into the settings & set up something that already existed beforehand. But whatever. As long as I'm not constantly switching back and forth between apps.",2
"An amazing app. I've been personally using it since 2017. It hasn't let me down. Good for multi-tasking, however, it sometimes contains errors, but don't worry they're minor errors. Some common errors I encountered are, no connection even though my internet works just fine, poor connection even though me and the person I'm talking to don't have any issues, and lately I've been having some weird things happen. Such as accounts getting restricted, and people getting blocked for no reason at all.",2
"When my friends send an attachment, when I tap on it to open it, it'll do like I want to react.. and even when the send d attachment, it won't even show, same goes for pics.. when I now tap it, for it to load, it'll do like I'm reacting too.. I only gave it 4 stars bcoz of how good d app's been doing since.. and I believe u'll fix dis bug soon",2
"I've been using this app for years. But wow, it has gone downhill the past two years. My messages will take days to come despite having wifi/data. I have to force stop the app several times a day so it stops freezing my phone. Video calls are hit or miss - they either connect or just don't. Sending pics/videos is an absolute nightmare as well because it makes the app crash. I've tried reinstalling it over and over. Please fix it????",2
"The app is great and it constantly adapts to it's users, the only thing I don't like is the end-to-end encryption. Why can't it be toggled on and off? I lost so many old data that I need because of it. A chat automatically encrypted and neither me or this friend of mine know why. Now; old files, data, pinned information, pictures are lost to us, we can no longer access them. Can you Make it so that users have the will to turn this off?",2
"It's a pretty good app, you could chat and video call friends or families that are far away. But, I suggest if you guys can move the 'Add to story' while sending a picture or video to a friend. A lot of people would accidentally click it and the picture or video will be added to story. Especially the embarrassing pictures that was only meant for the friend or families that I can sent, Eventually I have to quickly delete it again and again.",2
"I would enjoy having the option to Mark As Read from the message notification - I think it would be far more useful than the Like button that's currently there. This is especially true in chats where the default Like (thumbs up) has been changed to another emoji - if you hit the Like button it sends the chat's quick react emoji, NOT a thumbs up. So the Like isn't even doing what it says it's doing. Please switch to Mark As Read!",2
"I'm only giving this 4 stars because other features are not available or is not showing up. Like the notes feature, all my friends have one but mine does not. Please fix this problem, I know it's just a simple feature but I like the notes feature and I am bummed that mine does not have it but my friends have.",2
"Suggestion: please add a feature where we can add a sound notification to every person or gc individually. Like for example, Sound Notification 1 to Raoul Riego, sound notification 2 for Maria. It's purpose is to know who is the sender when it will sound. Because there are many unimportant messages i will receive and it is hassle to open something that isn't important. I've thought about it last year and i still don't see any feature of this so i hope you will notice it. Thank you in advance",2
New update has a few issues. If I hit the reply in my notifications and hit send it never goes through to my messenger. So I have to open messenger and retype the message. Also all of my pinned comments in my conversations are gone. I actually use the pins a lot for important information that I share between me and my husband. Now I have to remind him the code to our storage unit every time.,2
"I used to like this app a lot but since I've updated it, clicking the chathead just directs me to app and won't open like it normally does. I do like to use chathead chat while surfing on Internet or using other apps. This glitch is a mood killer since I keep have to switch in between apps only to send a text. My messages also gets saved as drafts randomly even without leaving the app and keep appearing while I'm texting other things. I'm starting to consider to use another message app.",2
"I like messenger because it has like customizing themes if you like or you can create groups you an make calls text or voice message You also have filters if you want to take photos straight away You can name them what you want but,one issue I would have gave it 5 stars, if it didn't show what I was naming her/him, that's not it When I don't want to answer a call I have to decline it. Well that's fine but why show that person ""I declined the call"" When I meet them irl they'll ask me why I did it",2
"i like it, it makes me have communication with my family from far away. Only problem is the end to end encrypted. Whenever i have a conversation with someone, most of the texts are missing. Mostly it skips to a month. Which i hate, meaning i cannot backread the important texts i have. Can you perhaps fix it?",2
"Not sure what's going on but I keep getting a 'null' message saying I can switch messenger in between accounts which pops up EVERY time I switch accounts. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app etc., but it's continually happening. It's driving me nuts!!",2
My conversation with my friends AUTOMATICALLY switched to end-to-end encrypted. I'm so confused and worried that our conversation might be deleted. I hope you guys at least put choices if we want end-to-end encryption or not.,2
"No idea what caused this but suddenly you can't switch photo albums in the app, it will just display the default album regardless of selection. Otherwise it works fine.",2
Okay this app is op. First of all why I'm not rated this 5 star is that you need a facebook account. Granny and grapas your good. Anyways. Yea this is an easy texting app we're you can easily make chat groups. Send stuff easily. It Is also very customisable with texting backgrounds. It also just very clean. It's better then default texting apps. But not better then discord.,2
"I actually like the new features and the new design of messenger! One problem though is that you can not recover your messages ones you lost your key. Can you add a feature where their will be another loophole for the user to regain access to your previous messages? This would help much. All in all, its getting better! Keep it up!!",2
"Messenger is all good and stuff nothing so bad about it, but you might be wondering why i gave you four stars instead of five, my problem here is that messenger keeps updating frequently, which is not too bad. But like if you dont update, the messages you send will be so slow. Like it takes 7 seconds just to send a message just because its not updated, which is kind of annoying, including the frequent update about this.",2
"I like the latest update of messenger, not to compare to other applications with the same purpose and function, but i think maganda siya if you allow a money transferring towards someone or for everyone, like it can be sending gifts with amount value or just a direct transferring of money. and regarding on video story, maybe much better if the duration or the length of the video you can put on story is longer. and just to add pls remove the end to end encryption cause it suvks.",2
"I use Messenger as my daily text messaging app. Ever since the update, it hasn't been showing some messages it will say, ""Waiting for this message. This might take a while."" But then it never shows the message. I have to screenshot and get others to screenshot what they sent just to see their messages. I'll just use my phones text messaging until you guys get this fixed.",2
"Lately, I have been trying to get into Messanger app, but I've noticed that You've got to use a password. I don't think that it's a very good idea. I've Always been able to access my own apps, without having to put up with having to use a password. So, if You want Me to have to go through ""having to"" give You a password, I would REALLY rather just ""Delete"" the ""app"", Altogether!!.",2
Usually works pretty well and has lots of useful features. Newest update seems to have broken the feature where I can tell who is and isn't online when I am. Not sure what happened to my little green dot. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it didn't fix it. *sigh* I wish they'd quit trying to fix what wasn't broken and end up actually breaking features that worked fine until then.,2
"Having problems with words with friends via messenger app. Have already sent requests to fix. The screen app in the game is so out of wack that I can not see the letters at the bottom, etc. Cannot seems to delete this game in messager, and I have rebooted the phone so many times, but it still will not fix it. Not happy!",2
Well I was going to watch a reel on Facebook I clicked on it and then suddenly it says session over like what is this app even talking about its telling me to log back in with the same user but it doesn't work this app is getting really confusing but still positive things my messages send my calls send I can send videos without a problem but it's annoying with other things please fix this app its really annoying and confusing!,2
"It's a good app, but I had to delete it recently because I keep getting ghost calls from past missed calls, and I keep getting notifications from old messages. I'll be using Instagram as a means for video calls and messaging for the time being. ✌️",2
"It's just good. It helps connect to people and friends you've lost contact with years, and helps renew relationships with friends, families and love ones. The App is also very easy to use and creates convenience and security for users.",2
"With the new encrytion it seems more people are not getting calls and messages. Not sure why this is. I do like the app, but with changes come bugs and bugs seem to not get fixed very fast anymore. Maybe it is just me. Bur I am thankful for you developers.",2
"1.Nice app, but why not integrate it with Facebook just like Facebook lite has a direct messaging section. 2.When I am messaging multiple people and am to type in the name of someone and message a particular person. When I go back to the previous page, the names that displayed after I had typed in the name of the person I just texted all disappear and so I have to type in the name of the next person am texting; I have to repeat the same thing over and over again.",2
"While it's good and all, I kind of missed out some actions... ca you add something like ""pinned conversations"" or ""starred conversations"" in messenger in general? I sometimes confuse them not being starred, and at times I need to find the conversation without remembering the conversation name. I hope this hopefully works in group chats and private messages. Thank you!",2
"Very easy to use and I love the contents, but I don't like the end-to-end encryption feature, it is useful at some point but it's contents kinda boring. Sometimes my notifications don't come on time as the other user sent it to me, probably need to look into that please",2
"It's really weird like I'm just sitting here thinking that this thing wants me to go backwards with the actions that I had done earlier that day. But the entire time I'm just like, I'm I really doing this right? LOL... But get it I was learning. And that's why my phone was just bleeding out ads and blinging off the chain ⛓️ earlier. Thanks Google. Maybe y'all should say hi once in a while so I don't look so crazy. Lol. Later.",2
"can you fix your messenger? especially in the Background of the conversation, it's annoying because instead of the beautiful background, the background has become black and the background image has shrunk, please fix it, your messenger app is beautiful, but the background is really messed up, that's it .",2
I actually find this app very good especially when I went to London I thought I'd have issues with it but I did not Just one thing I would love to see is more filters for taking pic like where u can change the background screens in the pics I don't know it might be asking for too much 😄 other then that I would have given 5 stars,2
The sounds of the app disturbs other apps and i don't know why. It pauses the sounds of other apps that is playing in the background which is totally disturbing especially when I am playing music from other apps. Please fix this.,2
"Hi Messenger! I have a suggestion. I hope you consider adding a feature in your next update that shows a mark or note indicating our last seen or start of unread messages. Backtracking becomes challenging, especially in lengthy conversations. I appreciate your attention to this. Thank you.",2
"it's less buggy now but i hope you guys add the the remove messages feature FOR SENDING MESSAGES like even before it was sent, you have the option to REMOVE/NOT SEND THE MESSAGE COMPLETELY. but it's been working better and that's a big improvement. still not perfect but atleast we're getting there somehow.",2
Constantly lagging when I am using gifs sending photos. working very slow have full network connection and sufficient storage space Ram also freed up but there is no such improvement in the app. Other applications runs smoothly and working properly. Updated the messenger but still got the problem from the app,2
It's pretty universal for a messaging app and I have noticed that there are some new features I didn't know about before and I think it's not the same as it was originally but for sure many necessary improvements and additional things I think are helpful as well as unique aside from others.,2
Recent update (end to end encryption) I am unable to see when certain of my contacts have received or read my messages. There is no profile picture showing when message is read. Please can you look into this issue. Thank you,2
"Good experience. But there's a problem I'm facing,I lost the code to restore my end to end crypted chat with a friend,that is why I'm not being able to restore my chats which is a regrettable matter,so if it's possible could you please add a solution for those people who have lost their code, so that they can restore their chats without having a problem. Maybe, there's a lot of people like me who are having same trouble.Forgot to mention that I lost the 40 character code but I still have the pin",2
"please return quick emoji either to natural size or give us option and we will use it as we want. Like tapping it for a long time and making it bigger, it was like this in the past but it wasn't designed very comfortable to look at and baloon voices also was disturbing. It will be better to be like: taap smal size pops then bigger one and the biggest one.",2
"Can you please allow people to be able to choose to have a copy of the conversation and send it through their e-mails to save the convo instead of screenshotting every single message. Thank you, and you've been doing a great job.",2
"Although it's a great app, im really disappointed in how downhill it's gone. Sometimes I can't find certain messages or if I'm searching in the search in conversations link, the conversation subjects will either be missing or change to an unrelated topic",2
"I propose a ""Seen message but you're invisible"" so that you can "" seen"" the messages yet people wouldn't be able to notice you've seen the chat already, thus leaving your chat head/bubble where it last left off while the feature is enabled. It's good for avoiding scams or hate messages.",2
"Everything is really good. Texting, calling, etc. The only thing that I wish would change is that it bands me from calling, texting, everything for about 3 days at the most and I didn't even do anything for it to band me. It hasn't done it recently but it has done it to me twice",2
"I can't send my pdf files! The app has some issues lately. Please enable Android users to be able to send pdf files in private message. It is really inconvenient But overall, it's very useful.",2
"I enjoy being able to keep the chat head on my screen, and having different themes and emojis and stickers is very fun. I do wish that they would keep the Pin function though because it's very handy.",2
"Really convenient, but could you guys add a feature where all voice messages can be viewed? it quite hard finding the right voice messages that I want to return to. I just think it's a great idea to have this feature since the app already has the ""search conversation"" feature that allows you to search specific messages. It would be a really great addition to the apps' convenience. I hope you notice this review!!!☺️☺️☺️",2
I had a very unpleasant experience with chatting which is Why I had to cancel my membership for awhile. Many people pretending to be the real actor was not. It was very deflating and sad. These pretenders only wanted money. I just liked polite communication.,2
"For some reason, I have to hit dismiss on my lock screen notifications for the same message about 6 times before it gets the point. Noticed that this issue started about 2 months ago.",2
"It is a very amazing app. But developers should add more things like (1) Only admin can send messages in group (2) If the admin deletes anyone's message, it will be deleted by everyone And when the message is deleted from everyone, its icon will disappear as if there was no message at all. Please add all these features developers please",2
The new updates are great. The only thing missing now is a good ui and ux. And a customization feature that changes the look and colors throughout the app. Great work btw👏,2
"The update is good like notes, and message storage. but PLEASE Bring back the old chat heads. So I can chat them easily *not opening Messenger to chat them. If I have a the chat heads. O can message them easily. Of bubbles whoever texts me I can only them them.",2
"It's actually helpful on everything, specially in communicating or interacting with people, I just having some delays and errors like in chat where I already seen the lates message and then it still marks as unread even the reaction of the person that I talked to.",2
"Ever since the newest update I am unable to see photos, gifs or stickers. I have researched and did what was said and it still doesn't work. I even deleted cache, data and checked my permissions, no luck. I'm tired of not being able to see those images. What do I do or how can it be fixed?",2
Idk what they did with the most recent update but it's almost impossible to send video now (maybe it's android specific). You also now have to reduce the video down to a certain size before sending.,2
The new update is a downgrade to the app. The encrypted messages is useless for me and I can no longer forward a file using my phone. I need to used a laptop to send a file. Please bring back the old messenger 😭,2
It's a great app but after about 3 years of use it started acting slow and sometimes didn't even send messages. it still acted slow even after I cleared out some storage and updated it.,2
"Allover it's good, But when someone replies to shared attachment it doesn't show anymore. If one shares multiple attachments then it's a nightmare. hope they fix it back.",2

"So far I've had minimal glitches, and usually if one occurs within just couple hours or less its resolved. The new backgrounds are pretty cool, wish there were a little more to choose from. Sending/recieving money is handy! I also recently tried talking with the META AI and that was an experience. Very realistic for the most part, there are still aspects of it with repetitive phrases that give away the artificial side of it, but all in all it's a very well interactive service.",2
"I've been using Messenger for years. As with any app, each new version either improves on existing features and/or adds brand new ones. The face-time-like call ability is fabulous (especially when picking stuff up for someone and being able to show them quickly not only the item you grabbed, but all other similiar items instead of taking pics or trying to describe it). Being able to share stuff instead of posting to a FB page is great as well as its use w/ buying and/or selling on Marketplace.",2
I love how I can send a full video without it breaking up and how I can send lots of pictures with videos at one time. It saves me time. Thank you. Now if there was a way I can label the person name or put in a group type file THAT WOULD BE PERFECT because people change their profile picture or something and I can't remember who is who and it takes so long to scroll down the page trying to find the person I want to chat with. Other than that I ❤️ it.,2
"Great message app, it works well, never a bug known or a crash for over 8 years. Seem to have had a few audio call breaks in n out but nothing at all different from what you could experience from mobil service unexplitively. Maybe 96% reliable on a whole absolutely unbiased everyway. The iOS compatible bridge too or from is rock solid coming with 0 negative event reports from all of our 5 lines on account. Rearly heard any info if ever, in passing along communications. Emojis/gif well done.",2
"My experience was great with ""Messenger"" it helps me engage with people that want's to keep messages private. And keeping messages mutual an private is a great privilege. Are you can have conversation on Face time with whom ever you'd like to, if your phone is compatible with the ""Messenger "" app. But this app is another way to conduct business. If you want to keep conversations private talk on ""Messenger"", & if you want to keep thing's personal just text.",2
Love this app. If your ever having issues with your cellphone and can't make calls/sent text messages. Always go straight to Messenger from Facebook. Not only can you send & receive messages. You can call & FaceTime. The best it's absolutely FREE. And you don't have to watch any type of commercials/advertising ads. So I give this 10/ out of 10+ off the charts!! Thank You Meta/Facebook/Messenger you guys ROCKED this App. PLEASE don't change anything.,2
"Best app for secure encrypted messaging, video chat, file sharing, payments, etc. Unlike other supposedly ""secure"" messaging apps, the content you share stays within Meta (FB, Instagram, Snap, etc.) & isn't sold to any outside vendor, and not with law enforcement either unless you have allowed permission for them to do so via the Legacy option for example.",2
"Edit: Was 1 star since 2019 and a recent update has brought an overhaul. UI is snappier, much less buggy. Thank you for the good work! --- In the past few months the app has just become an inusable pile of bugs. Updates with features keep rolling in breaking more and more. Bugs never get fixed. I know that no self-respecting experienced developer would work ar facebook, but even with what you have, please try to fix the app up.",2
"Since the new updates (March 2024) everything works better and the new additions are brilliant.

The app has been running pretty smooth lately. The only glitch I'm seeing recently is some of the messages I recieve look like I've opened them already when i haven't. I've checked log ins and I'm the only one logged in. But the new msgs aren't highlighted like other unopened msgs.,2
"Nice app, but i miss the old messenger where there was an option to go back to the topmost of our unread messages in group chats, life was easier back then. But nowadays, we have to manually scroll which is kind of annoying. But still, undoubtedly, this is a very useful app.",2

"PLEASE CONSIDER THIS SUGGESTION. Can I get a feature where I can move a message to the top of queue? like in addition to mark as unread, I want the message to refresh to the topmost for reminder reasons. I feel like 5 staring this review will make my suggestion neglected, but I dont want to lower my review just to make my suggestion possible.

"The latest update has moved the sticker and emoji groups to the very, very bottom of the screen. If you use swipe gesture controls it's near impossible to not swipe directly out of the app entirely. Completely unnecessary and a huge hindrance to the user experience. edit: The updated shade of bright green looks atrocious. Jesus Christ, give UI color options if that's the best you can come up with.",0
"Update to the update, throws error saying poor Wi-Fi signal. I literally am sitting two feet away from a high-end router with a fiber internet connection. Update: Even worse than before. Latest update has really screwed it up. Rings but doesn't show notification sometimes it doesn't ring at all. Absolutely terrible since the past few updates. While on video call if a sms or voice call rings my phone it disables audio on video call. If while in a video call I reduce screen then open say gmail..",0
"As of 4/13. Whatsapp tooo many people are being hacked. Security is horrible, service is getting poor. It was a great app for communication but decided to become social media like and it went down form there. Old: Latest update is messing up my videos. I can but send a video via message, can't upload my story, and cannot watch a video or story without screen going blank. Everything else fine!",0
"The latest WhatsApp update has introduced a color scheme that many users find irritating and eye-straining, with a selection of hues that can be overwhelming. Additionally, the updated user interface (UI) has been described as clunky and unintuitive, leading to a less than satisfactory user experience. These changes have sparked considerable frustration among the user community, calling for a more thoughtful approach to app design that prioritizes usability.",0
"Whatsapp is already having problems, and the fact that it's such a good app for viewing, calling and messaging is such a pity. Its quite literally a virus on my device because everytime I delete media, images, archives, turn off data. The space it takes up increases, going from 3 GB to 5-6 GB. It's the most annoying problem and quite irritating. Stop fixing things that dont need to be fixed and actually start fixing the bugs/glitches in the apps, developers.",0
"It is one of the most popular, but the worst app possible. There are a lot of annoying things here, but the most annoying is that you can't use it on multiple devices simultaneously. If you try to switch to a new phone, and get a code in the old phone app, it will log you out without transferring chats! In order to transfer chats, I had to get code by SMS (which is limited), or by call, then transfer chats, then you're okay. I mean what kind of app doesn't load all the chats automatically???????",0
This used to be an amazing app. But with every update it got worse. Switching status to updates is very annoying. The channels are just confusing. It doesn't let you post HD statuses anymore. It just compress your status so the photos or videos look like it was taken on a $5 camera. The new design is just horrible. They moved everything to the bottom. And they put communities right in between status and calls. Which is really annoying. And really in the way 😡,0
"They integrated search functions within the app with MetaAI. I consider this a major privacy violation. When I want to search for messages within my conversations, I want an indexed search result that is contained within the device. By combining metaAI into the search bar, I now have no idea if my searches through my private messages to friends and families is now being sent to Facebook servers for processing. It is not clear to me if this feature can be turned off.",0
"I don't know what has happened, but as of recently, I cannot have a video call without it reconnecting at least 5 times and the call dropping. I'm connected to strong wifi, and nothing has changed, so I don't understand why I'm having these issues now. It's extremely frustrating and makes communicating almost impossible. It is taking all my self-discipline to not get disrespectful and unleash a slew of profanity.",0
"I had initially found this app to be an excellent tool for managing not only SMS and calls but also a myriad of other features. However, my recent experience has left me frustrated and disappointed. I am currently unable to log in with my registered WhatsApp number, as the app prompts ""We couldn't send an SMS or CALL to your number"". I hope the developers address and resolve this matter promptly to restore the app's functionality and user experience to its former glory.",0
"Backups and account management are well understood in computing, how on earth can a massively funded company not figure out how to reliably get app data from one device to another when switching devices???? It's EMBARRASSING how unreliable ""backup"" is, and how utterly awful the handover is when switching sims between phones. Shameful that people continue to use this.",0
"The calling feature on a Note 20 Ultra really sucks. I have two phones, a note 20 and a note 8. I rarely have problems with a video call freezing up or dropping on the note 8, but it does it all the time on the note 20 to the point where it's almost impossible to make a video chat call without it freezing up or the call dropping. It's a good thing I have two phones, but I find it odd that this app works better on my old note 8 than it does on my note 20. They're both on the same network too.",0
"The updates tab is so annoying. Every time you wanna go to calls, you swipe from chats to calls passing by the channels section (which is located exactly where your fingers are naturally) which prevents you from navigating to calls tab. Instead it stops at updates tab and scrolls through channels section. Please allow to remove updates tab all together. Never used it and never want to. Also the new navigation bar at the bottom is super annoying. Please revert back to original design",0
"Apart from the normal features this app is a bum. I no longer have the ability to see deleted messages, can't view a status without been seen and several other tweaks that whats app plus had. It's like I went back in time. If your gonna take away a good platform atleast give us something to work with not just the basics. I hate this app now!!!",0
"Backup/phone transfer system is HORRIBLY BROKEN!!!! I scanned the QR code. It gave me an error, ""there was a problem"". Okay, how about we try again... It won't let me. It just went through the setup. I tried force closing the app and what not trying to get it to start over. However every screen it gives me advances the setup process. No way to try the code again. My old phone was immediately logged out of Whats App aswell so I assume all the media data is gone now..... I am extremely angry & sad",0
"I have been using whattsapp for years and have always had a great experience. However, in recent times, with the edition of channels and meta AI, I no longer get the basic and optimized functionality that I always appreciated from whattsapp. Instead I get a bundle of services including things I don't want from my messaging app. It would be great if it was possible to disable some of these features or if you could create a whattsapp lite.",0
"NEW AI META is manure. The app was brilliant until you added this with the latest update. It is constantly in the way on the Chats and Updates screens. I don't know what to use it for. I feel the same about Communities. I will never use it, as I don't have the need for it. I like the ribbon tabs at the bottom, that is good. I can understand that a lot of people like and use the new AI and Communities features. PLEASE offer an option within the settings to disable the features if you want to.",0
"They are changing too much, too quickly. The green colour on the send button ect. was fine and then they made it into an ugly neon green. The fingerprint lock was changed and has started glitching, making us stuck on the ""Unlock"" screen. Why was this even changed? It was perfect and better before. People are turning to fakes to get the older versions back. Listen to the consumers.",0
"The recent update, which moved the navigation bar to the bottom, is not desired by anyone. Another problem is recent change in the colour scheme of the application , it is very uncomfortable to our eyes. Additionally, repositioning the search bar to its previous location would be beneficial, as it is inconvenient to scroll to the top of chats to access it. Instead of altering the interface, focus on adding features without disrupting the layout. Certain elements are best left unchanged.",0
I used to really enjoy WhatsApp until its recent changes. The interface has gone from neat and minimalistic to chunky and crude. The AI that cannot be turned off is a frustrating imposition. I hope enough people will complain for this feature to at least be made optional if not removed. Would very much appreciate users having choice between previous and updated interface too. That would be truly a user-friendly app.,0
"• Updated icons and illustrations • Updated colors. The navigation bar at the top of the screen is now white Why? Colors are to bright now. It bothers my eyes if I look at wa screen for too long. The navigation bar at the top of the screen is now white, so that it blends in with the color of the phone and received messages, it's unreadable. I don't like this new update at all. Whats app is in general good, but this updated is just bad.",0
"This app is good but gives me problems anytime there is an update. I don't know if it's only on my phone; It stops working and I have to delete and install again and once I install,my phone number registration is never completed I have this same problem up until now. It just shows connecting over and over again and after a while it shows 'whatsapp service status unavailable' and it's really stressing me out, and I can't do anything about it. Please I need help!!!!!",0
"WhatsApp has been one of the most convenient and efficient apps made, atleast until the new update. The most recent update has come with so many challenges. The new WhatsApp is slow and crashes all the the time. It no longer stays logged in with the desktop and once logged in, it significantly slows down the entire phone. The search bar is also inconvenient to access. @WhatsApp team please allow the option to return to the previous version.",0
"WhatsApp used to be a great space to talk to friends and family, but of recent, it's becoming extremely distracting to use. Starting with the channels, and now the AI assistant. Please remove these updates. All I want is just an app to chat, without unnecessary distractions. Keep that for instagram. Or at least give us an option to turn them off!",0
The new updates and the latest integration of Meta AI are very unpleasant. The App has changed allot in a very short period (within a month). The previous version was perfect. Actually the version before the Channels were integrated! The bright neon green is painful to the eyes and the whole change in the layout is just NOT IT. Please change it back. Let's leave a messenger app as a messenger app and as minimalistic as possible. There are other Apps for AI and news etc.,0
"It has so many bugs and its never going to work right. When I save a contact in my phone, their number wont appear in the app and it has to take a long time to show up... The date and time of chats goes wrong recently and a conversation from months ago goes on top of the conversations... I wonder when is it going to be fixed after all these years...",0
"Why would anyone capitalize ""online"" and ""typing"" status? Now it visually clashes with the person name and looks like a last name. Ridiculous, don't do this. Also, don't change the UI in general, since it breaks the UX. For example, the Chats/Status/Calls tabs were moved to the bottom, now it's difficult to reach the top chats - while being on the top it wasn't a problem because you could just swipe.",0
"Recently, I had to uninstall WhatsApp due to a fingerprint error that prevented me from accessing the application. After resolving the fingerprint issue, I reinstalled WhatsApp, expecting to regain access to all my chats and media, including photos. However, to my dismay, I discovered that all my photos were lost from the gallery and not restored during the reinstallation process.",0
"the app works fine but i have trouble understanding what the need is to constantly update how everything looks. as an autistic individual i find this very frustrating & i wish they wouldn't change the colour schemes, or at least have an option for the old ones, as the new ones hurt my eyes. the new light mode is almost solid white everywhere, making it incredibly bright & the new dark mode is awful to look at. the green is too bright & the grey is too dark, it looks radioactive. please fix this.",0
"I really hope if this would be seen, and addressed! I woke up this morning and tried opening my WhatsApp to reply messages from yesterday, and I kept getting a message to ""Restore Chats"". I clicked on this option a lot of times and my WhatsApp kept closing each time. each time I try to open again, I get the same message, and same process. Then, I clicked skip.. only for my WhatsApp to open and I have lost ALL my chats!! like ALL!! chats of almost 2 years I have been using this phone!!!!!!",0
"Used to love this app. Recent changes are unnecessary and annoying. Why change displays that people have grown accustomed to? And when will the meta ai toggle off button become available because i do not need this feature, nor do i want to see it. Video call and voicecalls remain only ok. Theyve never been amazing quality. So with the recent facelift I am considering using a different app. It seems the efforts towards improvement are focused on the wrong things.",0
"Please stop updating the app! No one likes it. Search bar takes up too much space on your screen, the new send button color is awful, and looks like an app where you need to watch an ad every time you want to press a button. The fact that you changed the chat, status and call bar to the bottom, makes it even worse. No one watches anyone's statuses anymore because of that. When I'm in a hurry trying to call someone it feels like i need a tutorial first. Verry irritating. Absolutely loved previous",0
"Date stamp and timestamp Why doesn't the app have datestamp and timestamp on every message sent and received? It should, now that would be a convenient feature to have, instead of scrolling all the way up to find the date of a message. All of the convenient features that are actually useful, they don't put it on the update but annoying features they have no problem with, give your heads a shake and think of the end user and what we really want.",0
"Whatsapp is one of the few apps that I genuinely love. It's easy to use, streamlined, and very reliable. Unfortunately, the latest update has added a very annoying Meta AI search bar at the top of the app. Frustratingly, this bar cannot be removed. Even worse, I asked the Meta AI function (my first interaction with Meta AI) how to hide the bar and it provided an incorrect answer. It couldn't even get such a basic detail right! It goes to show why I'm justified in wanting the bar removed.",0
The new integrated meta and channel features have taken away from what WhatsApp was intended for (messaging). It went from a simple and clean interface to something chaotic. Please change it back to the way it used to be. Or find a way to integrate those features where it doesn't take up so much of space.,0
"I lost all my messages because of 1 mistake. I accidentally clicked on skip restore while installing it on my new phone. Then it just backed up the new messages which overrided the previous backup file. I had thousands of important starred messages, audio notes, and so many memories. All because of an accidental tap to which there's no prevention or correction. For you guys it's all tech but they were really important messages for me. Thanks for nothing.",0
"One of the most useless messaging apps I've ever seen in my life. The more it gets updated the more it gets degraded. Even though it has enabled the option to add multiple WhatsApp account, but still you can't do it properly. It won't let you restore your previous backed up chats. It's interface is getting more complicated and extremely annoying. If things are not gonna change then I guess I'll have to delete this bogus app.",0
"having troubles with the quality of video calls lately. it keeps on lagging and sometimes showing poor connection wherein we have fiber wifi connection. have done video calls outside of Whatsapp to see if it will result the same, but nope and results are doing perfectly good. but when it comes with Whatsapp video calls, it isn't. it hasn't been like this before.",0
"I recently came across the new feature on WhatsApp, but unfortunately, it hasn't quite resonated with me. The updated design and color scheme don't align with my personal preferences, and I find it less intuitive than the previous version. I hope you'll consider taking user feedback into account and making adjustments to enhance the overall user experience. Specifically, I'd love to see an option to switch back to the classic design or offer more customization options for the color scheme.",0
"The recent update has made the experience awful. No one needed that update. The shift of the navigation buttons, and search bar is unwanted. The app now looks very ugly, and has disappointed us a lot. It would be better if there was no update like that. The company is changing its layout and UI again and again, which further makes the app look ugly.",0
"Fix the glitches as soon as possible, it's pointless, if you keep on adding features but unable to maintain the proper functioning of the system......please work on that.... Maintaining the features, is important. Glitch, for example I am sending a text but the clock timer symbol at the corner is not changing into the.... Tik symbol, (even if my internet connection is strong)",0
"New design is very annoying, old one was easier on the eye and much better. Why changing something that worked???? The whole interface is white, I can't see any contour around the messages. I hate it!! Why not introducing personalisation on the interface itself? I would change it to some colour, it is all fading into whiteness now, it hurts my eyes.☹️",0
"I don't like the new whatsapp updates, I think nobody likes it. The search button is now AI thing and I want it back where it was like a🔍. The status and calls and chats where ussaully on the top and not the bottom, status became updates and that was fine but I want it back on the top. The emojis and stickers/gifts where also switched, switch it back. It is fine that the buttons colours changed. None of my friends, family and me myself like it. Please Whatsapp change it back to how it was.",0
"Why fix something that's not broken...the search button was perfectly fine as it was. To change it to a search field found only at the top is a very big inconvenience, as I have to now scroll ALL the way to the top to access it. Please revert back to search button ASAP as there was nothing wrong with it initially for the programmers to change it. Big disappointment for me.",0
"Frustrating - I have previously been able to take screenshot of messages and photos, but suddenly, I have just tried to take a screenshot, but I got the error message stating that 'WhatsApp' doesn't support it! Why all of a sudden! On contacting the help centre, they claimed that they don't support such queries, then they sent me a link to their FHQs!",0
"I just received the update for the app and I do not like the new look at all. The new look with the icons on the bottom of the screen instead of the top makes it look not as professional looking, clean, or sharp. It looks more like a social media platform and thats not what whatsapp is. Its an application where you can communicate with friends and family all over the world, not checking how many people have viewed your stories. Update: I just received another update. I hate it. 1 ⭐",0
"The update regarding the channels was completely useless as, it isn't youtube to introduce this feature. Previous version was better. This is yet the worst update so far. Also the interface and navigation bar issue as many users are saying. Now even the shade of green in the dark mode is causing an irritation to the eyes, the previous shade was better.",0
whatsapp has always been a great app but recently I have two issues. my media doesn't display on my gallery even after using android 11 migration so if I want to see any media I need to go to my files. secondly the new sticker tray is full of bugs. the pop-up is slow and when using it there are lots of faults. please fix this or make an option to keep the classic sticker tray instead of the new one,0
"WhatsApp keeps making constant changes to its user interface, which can be frustrating. Each update introduces a new layout with the same features, but instead of enhancing user experience, these changes often lead to confusion. We hope for an update that includes the ability to upload high-quality videos for statuses or updates. I can't justify giving more than a one-star review.",0
"When the display is in night mode or day mode, sometimes there are bugs. the color of the writing becomes contrasting and very disturbing. Sometimes when sending a message the text becomes unreadable. Apart from that, my first WhatsApp account and the second account have a different appearance. My first account hasn't changed to the new version.",0
"I ABSOLUTELY don't like it! It doesn't perform as well, or as easily and intuitively as other social-media messaging apps. Apparently, photos, vids, etc, have to be be put in a folder (which is NOT obvious!); but, even when friends send these to me, it's absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to either open visual medía, OR save them and then open them in one's phone visual media storage. In other words, an absolute disaster!!",0
"The new update says, ""You can have two accounts on one phone."" But we can't use the same account on two devices. I should consider this as a downgrade. Because telegram does offer both the options And what's the point of backing up the data if you log in from another device. You start fresh. Old chats are gone forever and noway to recover them. This app is being trash and then slowly becoming garbage after 2020",0
"With all the developments the quality of this app has dropped. I'm currently arguing with a 'robot', because it doesn't understand that previously every time I changed phone my chat history got transferred automatically until the last backup. Now, to make sure that I have the freshest of my chats, I proceeded a backup just before I registered on my new phone, and no chat history got transferred. Nothing. And 'the customer service' doesn't understand the issue, I could talk to a wall.",0
"Dropping rate from previous 4 stars down to a 1 star. Latest updates (Android) have made the appearance messy and annoying to work around. The original, clean, minimalist look has been replaced by all things Meta. Loss of real estate and now a negative user experience. Please go back to a neat, minimalist look and feel.",0
"The new version is an absolute mess. With the new UI upgrade, the accessibility and ease has diminished. Channels feature is the worst, deviating the purpose of an only chatting app. Having a restriction on viewing profile picture without watching the status first was the beginning of degradation. The present bugs are not fixed and a new one arises each day. The overall experience has been affected because of the above issues. The app needs to get back to its original form as it was a year back.",0
"The recent update, which moved the navigation bar to the bottom, is not desired by anyone. Additionally, repositioning the search bar to its previous location would be beneficial, as it is inconvenient to scroll to the top of chats to access it. Instead of altering the interface, focus on adding features without disrupting the layout. Certain elements are best left unchanged. Conduct a survey on the recent interface modification to gauge user dissatisfaction.",0
"Changing the design of the app made it much worse!! I had to switch to dark mode and it still hurts me to look at it. Why do we need the big Plus button to create group?? You don't do it a lot. And the switch board between calls, chats and more is too big with those icons. It doesn't much the usage, and the visibility is worse. Revert the Design!",0
"Bizarre AI update! Can no longer copy paste a website address for example. Only options are extract text, auto fill or clipboard which shows some strange stuff like my notes and not what I actually copied to paste! Will have to stop using this. Apparently pushing Meta AI is more important than actually allowing people to type or paste what they want to message. I ended up sending the links via Google chat. Bizarre. Have they removed all functionality now to push their stuff?",0
"The recent update, which moved the navigation bar to the bottom, is not desired by anyone. Additionally, repositioning the search bar to its previous location would be beneficial, as it is inconvenient to scroll to the top of chats to access it. Features like changing theme is also bad we want our old whatsap it's very bad to open whatsapp. Certain elements are best left unchanged.Conduct a survey on the recent interface modification to gauge user dissatisfaction.",0
"Functioned normally until today. It stopped working and didn't send my messages even though I had Wi-Fi. Second, when I could finally send messages I couldn't name any of my friends, all my chats were gone, and nobody had a name. Just their numbers. And then it tells me that WhatsApp is in perfect condition. No, it is not. Go fix your app about communication because this is not IT. Horrible. Not simple or reliable.",0
"Often updates has made the app user experience frustrating. The UI was simple, but in recent updates, its becoming very bloated hence confusing the daily users. As u know, the audience of whatsapp belongs to both educated and uneducated people. Also, the major issue I faced and others have faced too, is the Image quality issue. Whenever, I upload an image, its quality is drastically reduced. So kindly please look into this issue on priority.Thanks.",0
2024: I don't want a Meta AI chatbot in Whatsapp. Why is this embedded into the service with no option to remove it? I don't like being forced to use an LLM inside a texting platform. I want a simple and reliable app. Not overly complex garbage. 2023: You can not edit settings before restoring messages on a new phone. I.e. Your photo gallery will be a hodgepodge of photos from different times and Whatsapp messages because you can not change media settings before downloading a backup.,0
Don't make unnecessary changes in the app. The old version was the best. Bring back the search icon and what made you think about the search bar? That is very illogical. Offers nothing just makes the user experience worse! The colour scheme of the latest update is so uncomfortable to eyes. Don't change the old layout in the update just try to add new features dont modify the old ones please. I want to revert back to old version.,0
"Well, it used to be a five, but the recent updates are making me rate two. Channels!? You for real? The last thing I'd want is a place where there are only links to external apps or websites, it sux. Horizontal status, even worse, the ux is damn poor. Now whenever I try to forward sth it crashes and returns to the previous page. // 03 /04/2024 I really felt I had to come here again. I got even worse the navigation bar is on the bottom, it just sucks. I wish you could give us the rollback option",0
Every update introduces worse & more annoying features. Meta AI seriously sucks. I hate it. Everyone I know wants it off their phones. WhatsApp also changed my settings to update automatically - I had automatic update switched off. This was changed during an update. Channels is awful. Invasive & annoying. Give us the option to hide it rather than forcing it on so many people who don't want it. Telegram is a much better app - I use it wherever possible & I'm encouraging everyone to do the same.,0
"the new interface sucks, we've been used to the same interface for years, a change all a sudden is the worst thing that could've happened, and it's so annoying to have the ""tool"" bar at the bottom part of the screen, makes swiping more difficult, causing it to click on things instead of swiping up to close the application or swiping to the side, everything got ""overcomplicated"" and less minimalistic, at least give us the opportunity to choose the old interface.",0
"I usually don't write reviews, but this new update annoys me. The user experience is certainly a downgrade, if I had an option to roll back to the previous version, I would. The app already had an easy ""swipe"" to navigate between Chats, Status and Calls. Why change that? Now, I have to move my finger to the bottom of my screen to tap the buttons just to navigate these tabs. It just feels annoying, especially on a phone with large screen size. Please bring the Swipe back.",0
"The recent update in which the interface is changed, placing the navigation bar at the bottom, is the update wanted by none. Don't change the interface. If you have features, add it, no problem..but don’t play with the interface. Some things are better unchanged. Do a survey on the recent interface change and you will know how many users don’t like it.",0

"It seems that there is a problem with the video upload status when I attempt to upload a long video split into two, three, or four segments. The first segment uploads successfully, but subsequent segments (2, 3, 4, etc.) are unable to upload, and a pop-up message appears asking me to choose another video. This issue occurs consistently for all videos. Please fix it.",0
"I am so fed up. WhatsApp is a virus on my phone at this point. It keeps taking up all my storage. Taking up gigabytes of space within a few hours. I've attempted to report the issue via the Help>Contact us channel on the app, and received nothing but an AI reply. I am angry and frustrated. I've lost important media and correspondence from the last week. I've gone through the effort of recording the experience so that the developers can resolve issue, but no help is provided.",0
Looks like a recent update moved my status bar to the bottom of th screen. As per WhatsApp this is an intended functionality. Intended functionality is an easy way to escape. This is forcing the user to follow a path despite knowing it is confusing as you have mentioned. Because of this the display settings have gone hay wire and gives me only a limited portion of the screen to be used when compared to the previous version. Time for me to start thinking of an alternative. Useless UI.,0
"I've been using WhatsApp for years, but lately, it's become a nightmare. The constant barrage of ads is annoying, and the app crashes frequently. The privacy concerns are also troubling, with constant data sharing with Facebook. The user interface is outdated, and the lack of customization options is frustrating. Overall, I'm incredibly disappointed with WhatsApp and would not recommend it to anyone such a bad experience after the update app.",0
The worst messaging app. Audios stop playing when I open a picture (¿?). Stickers disappear without apparent reason. The chat backup system has always been awful and it's clear that there's no intention at all to improve it. The time it takes to upload to Drive is ridiculously slow. 2024 and you still have the same problem. DISASTER.,0
"Everything was perfect but recently you have been changing the UI over and over again and it's affecting the user experience, now when I try to unlock the app with my fingerprint it lags and the prompt to unlock covers my whole phone which means i can't use my phone until i reboot it the WhatsApp lock would be covering everything i can't even close WhatsApp itself it's frustrating, you are ruining our experience.",0
"The new UI update has completely ruined my experience with this app. In the past year they have just kept rolling out annoying updates like this that nobody asked for and is just an inconvenience that makes the whole app look so much worse. If there was any way to switch back to the old UI, I would take it immediately. Edit: Today it has gotten even worse with this new colour change, PLEASE add an option to revert this ugly change 👎",0
Update 4/13...you've now taken away the option of toggle ai off the screen because clearly no one wants it. Meta now dictating what people do or don't want on their ui. Ruining a perfectly good product Why add a toggle for the meta search and have the search bar take up a third of the screen. The magnifying glass was fine and universally recognized as the search. Pointless redesign when the UI is meant to be a messenger layout not an attempt at ripping off google,0
The new features are ugly and inconvenient. Shifting the menu tabs to the bottom makes some sense but installing the search tab in the chats makes the interface look weird and ugly. The archives don't help one bit what's the point of archives if they are displayed in the chats tab for everyone to see😩. Then there are channels I don't know why but some features should just stay ko instagram and Facebook there is no need to remind us that WhatsApp is also owned by Meta with every interaction.,0
"Like another review I just saw, I'm also unable to use my stickers, it doesn't let me scroll through them, and the app keeps crashing and bringing me back to the main screen while I'm typing mid-sentence and erases all that was written. This has been going on for a while and I thought the newest update woud fix it, but it didn't. It just ruined the app's aesthetic by moving the bar containing chats, groups.. etc down and made it more annoying to use.",0
"The application became so bad. It doesn't work properly There is always this message ""waiting for this message. This may take a while. "" So lots of chats don't appear whether for groups or individuals... In addition, when it came to the back up, it took like 2 months to back up 28 gigabytes !!! It was unbelievable. Besides, the slowness of uploading the files and chats in order to reinstall it and recover the chats. I am really upset of the application.",0
The recent update has a feature in which the WhatsApp privacy enables opening the app with fingerprint and also Pin or pattern. The earlier feature was better where we could choose to keep only the fingerprint as a security. Anyone knowing the phone PIN can open the App now (like kids at home). We need a choice that the App opens either ONLY with the User's fingerprint or another PIN different from phone's PIN and NOT two options together unless some recovery is needed.,0
"I want to be able to remove the recently added navigation menu at the bottom of my chats overview. I can initiate calls from the chats themselves. The ""updates"" and ""communities"" sections are features I don't use, and have no interest in ever using. This menu is taking up an annoying amount of visual space right in the centre of attention to house buttons I will never use.",0
"Disgusting updates. What is this? Glitches galore? No sense of regard for the user experience? Shifting around the navigation bar was tolerable but how did you let it get so glitchy? Duplicate messages, ghost message reactions that appear and disappear, and messages I've already read claim that I've never read them before. Yesterday a member left the group and the message ""XYZ left"" showed up ten times throughout the day. Get it under control. Makes me want to uninstall. Just sms me instead.",0
"Please remove meta AI from the search bar. It feels so invasive to my personal space especially because it is a personal mode of communication. It literally has it's own button below, I don't think you needed to place it there. I understand Instagram and other meta products, but putting it in the search bar of WhatsApp feels too invasive. If you don't want to remove it, make a version of WhatsApp that doesn't include it🤷",0
"Nonstop changes in the user interface are incredibly frustrating. Every time I open the app, it feels like I'm navigating through a maze of new layouts with same features. Instead of enhancing user experience, these changes only serve to confuse and irritate. It's disappointing that stability and familiarity seem to be sacrificed for the sake of unnecessary updates. Considering the constant disruptions, I can't justify giving more than one star review.",0
"This app started as a very nice and lightweight replacement for normal SMS (which was getting more and more spammed with ads). Ever since facebook acquired it, they kept of pushing useless updates dest the essential purpose of it was lost when people started pushing ads. And now we have an AI, like what the hell, like who reuqires an AI to send a personable text to a friend or a family member. This is really annoying how big companies like META destroy simple and elegant apps like this.",0
SEARCH option moved is very inconvenient. Have to scroll back all the way up to search. What is the point of this change if it has made things inconvenient. Also the green colour theme on chats was much better since it was clearer. The white colour on the top of a chat makes it harder to see the last seen and name of the person.,0
"This WAS a wonderful app for messaging would give it a 5 star rating but the changes are getting out of hand. Just put everything back as it was. It was easier to navigate without all the extras and changes every week. Need to learn from start where everything is. Option to hide channels, community and now the Meta AI this is all unnecessary. Maybe put channels and community in 1 tab. People dont use it. It's confusing to grandparents",0
"Why in the world is the pop up notification for the latest version of Android removed ? That defeats the purpose of interacting with the app. I don't receive notifications, I am using the galaxy s24. Contacted what's app support they said they removed this feature and they don't know when they'll have it back. I use what's app for very important conversations and messages. If this continues and this feature is not back I will switch to Telegram.",0
"I'm done with this app. It's totally cluttered with useless rubbish taking over the screen, I don't and never needed AI bullsh*t that is now imposed. All thus clutter makes for a frustrating app. No thanks. There's nothing wrong with simplicity like how it used to be. Nice to see the app paying for positive reviews from fiver though. Shows real integrity. *eye roll*.",0
"My last update has been annoying becos I have not be able to use the app becos the app can not be open again, I even thought it was the hacker which made me to delete the app & re-downloaded to set it up again and this resulted in me losing information of over four years. the worst thing is that the newly downloaded one too has started given the same problem & I don't know what to do.",0
"Please let us toggle off that voice record button. It's taking up the most prime real estate, and is so easy to trigger accidentally. Meta AI hasn't worked once for me yet. Either zero response, or it tells me there's no bots available. Maybe it shouldn't be accessible in three different places on the the Chats tab if it isn't actually working yet.",0
"Can't even send voice notes anymore and it was annoying to realize after 2 minutes of recording. I restarted then updated my app, checked permissions and mic was allowed. This is so annoying on top of the UI change and addition of channels in the status panel to condense my view. Why not make a separate section for that? Why would I want it in the status area to accidentally tap on stuff?",0
"After updates, many bugs with whatsapp have cropped up. The new UI is confusing. The status bar freezer showing an error and status videos of the contact just don't load up. Tried restarting and clearing cache as well. Also, voice messages take too long to load. The app has a lot of bugs. I use an airtel wifi(high-speed internet), but this app still shows issues.",0
"It's a good app, but the only thing you people need to work is, please work on the quality of the picture and videos that are received, you can send a picture/video with the good quality but when reaching to the destination it reaches with very low quality. Even when you want to post on status the pics/vids are of low quality. Please work on this.",0
"Regarding the recent updates to WhatsApp's interface, there seems to be a decline in its simplicity and elegance. The previous interface was straightforward and clean, but the recent changes in the last three updates have been disappointing, with each update making it worse. Honestly, not a fan of the direction it's heading.",0
"A few days ago, I updated my WhatsApp, but I've noticed that the fingerprint unlock feature in the new version is significantly slower. Sometimes, it doesn't even recognize my fingerprint. I've tried restarting my phone twice, but the issue persists. Can anybody help me with this, please?",0
Update: it's been over 3 months and nothing has been fixed. This app is basically a Part of my life but the amount of random freeze/lags that has been happening very frequently these day has left a bitter taste in my mouth. Please fix the lags and freeze especially when viewing status/stories. Update: Now it's moved to shoving these channels in my face while making the stories of my friends as small as possible. Make some actual improvements first and optimise the app.,0
"The Old version was better than the new update. The worst part is that they changed it's interface like what is the need of changing the interface everything moved like status,setting,calls, etc. One glitch is their that's needed to be fixed that I can't delete chats and files instantly. Humble request is that please change the interface and make it old otherwise I will delete it.",0
"Everything is going well, except for sharing images and videos via status! It reduces the quality and the resolution to a high extent until some become blurred! When you contact the support team, they always provide the same suggestions even if you say that you are already applying them... It's really an annoying bug that requests a solution!",0
Been facing issue with verification code. Tried contacting the support through mail but no luck. More than 15 hours I have been tried this call me or send sms option but no use. And I am not even getting any response from WhatsApp nor there is any contact info to call them directly. Very very much disappointed.,0
This app violates every privacy policy !!! Using users info to get them massacred by a fascist goverment is just insane. You must be trialed !,0

"I don't understand the rational of changing a GUI that people become accustomed to, especially to seniors like my grandma and my mother and non- tech savvy people who use this application to do simple things like calling. I don't know who makes these decisions but this is useless. Now with this AI widget, soo freaking ANNOYING!!! And does not even give you the option to disable it if you don't like it.

It's a 1 star for this update...dont download this new update if you have a number of whatsapp calls,0
"Recent updates and features are the worst. 1. AI...Like why? Rather have an option to use a WhatsApp without the AI icon on the search bar or anywhere in the app. 2. Chanels...for what? Same as with AI, let users decided to have them or not. 3. The worst part...the colour scheme and fonts, worsr mistake ever. Who ever agreed to all these changes must really been having a bad year or something. Why fix an already well functioning app. It suck big time now.",0

"I keep getting invites to groups from people I don't know. There is nothing I can find in settings to not allow group invites, etc. I also regularly get messages from people I dont know. The app is great to be able to communicate when on wifi during overseas travel, and I have lots of friends that use it as their primary messaging app, but the group invites are getting annoying. It would be great to have some setting to disallow non-contacts from adding you to a group.",0
I don't know what the problem is but I've only been able to use this app at least twice for the last past 2 or 3 weeks now it's been jumping back to my phone's main screen the app doesn't stay open for as long as one minute. I've tried everything from going to the settings to checking for updates for the app. unfortunately I've been told that perhaps I may need to factory reset my phone. Something I honestly don't want to have to do. Please help!,0
it's been about two months now. I don't know why but every time I make a video call the video is extremely narrow (as in squished together) making my video look thin. I've tried everything. reinstalled. updated my software. nothing. it's getting really annoying that nothing has been done to fix this issue. I'm using a OnePlus 10t.,0
"I'm writing this review cus I've been using Whatsapp without issues but now the glitches have gotten unbearable. Last time I couldn't even send messages or post on my status, but I could view previously posted status updates of my contacts. It eventually sorted itself out at the end of the day. Yesterday I was able to send videos and pics but at night I notice I just couldn't,only pics. Same thing with my status updates, just pics and it still continued this morning, so please resolve this issue",0
"I mainly don't like the app because it must be attached to the phone to use it. When you open the app, everyone can see that you is online. Maybe you don't have time to chat right then. You can't shut the notifications off completely. You can be listening to something or watching something and a whatsapp call will stop whatever you is watching. You should be able to shut down completely all text, calls or whatever if the app is not open. At least all us the ability to log in and out of the app.",0
"It's great to have a dedicated app for Wear OS. However, instead of being a proper companion app for the phone app, it seems to try to be its own instance like WhatsApp Web or Desktop, and thus, particularly for Bluetooth watches, it's unable to get notified of new messages along with the phone app and suffers from delays. It'd be great if you could implement something like Gmail or Samsung Messages, where the notification still comes from the phone with an option to open the watch app. Thanks!",0
"I've had this app since 2012/13 and it's always been my favorite. Ever since adding all the features it's been so many different glitches. Mostly being audio issues. Example: If you receive a call on your regular line while on a WhatsApp video call, that will cause the other parties not to hear you. We usually reboot our phone, or uninstall/reinstall, but we really shouldn't have to do that! I will be glad to remove this review once this issue is fixed!",0
"I love it, EXCEPT that it frequently loses messages that are only a few days old. I've researched it and cannot determine a reason. I've reinstalled several times. This has been happening over two or more years. My phone is very reliable and never more than 2 years old. My OS version is always up to date. My storage space is always adequate. WhatsUp??",0
"Used this for years due to work, friends home and abroad, communicating effectively with companies when in a poor telephone signal area, etc. I like the contact, the encryption, it's ease of use and fun. However, it is Very confusing to transfer from old phone to new, took lots of messing about. I'm not on Facebook or any other social media, so Google and WhatsApp together seems to have made getting a new phone really frustrating, upsetting and aggravating.",0
"The new UI changes were envisioned by some utterly insane folks. New button placement makes mistakes and missclicks from having a dirty screen more punishing and more common, as well as being very uncomfortable. My thumb points up when I'm holding my phone, why the hell would I want the buttons to be as low as possible? This is a change for mere novelty, and although I appreciate the attempt, it's a bad attempt. At least the new colors are nice, dark colors work well for me. Undo these changes.",0
"Whatsapp has always been my go-to messaging app from its inception. However, the recent app update is frustrating. I forgot many times that the status bar is now at the bottom of the screen. Please relocate it. The all white colour is not desirable at all. I use dark mode just not to see it. Sighsss Please restore some sense of normalcy to the app. Thank you in advance for your understanding, and I look forward to a better user experience in the following update.",0
"Since the latest Android 14 update on my device, there are issues with the application. 1. I do not receive any messages until I open the application. 2. The voice on video calls is also very weak or sometimes even isn't audible to the person on other side. Note: I have been on a stable internet connection while I faced the above mentioned issues.",0
"It was a great app until the recent updates. I was irritated by the communities update, then more irritated by the channels update so the AI option that I can't turn off is just a bit much. Changing the navigation of the main screen makes it less functional and I barely ever search anything so having the search bar take up so much space is useless. I just want to message people without my phone heating up.",0
"Great app but my concern is on the latest updates especially the AI search bar at the top and the navigation tools that where moved at the bottom of the chat menu. I would suggest that for every new update their should be a provision to turn it on or off, one has to decided whether to switch or not and also kindly add a black color background to the status color option for typed statuses it would make it better.",0
"The recent updates relating to the UI are unnecessary and terrible. 1) The changed accent and background colour is harsh plus puts strain on the eyes. 2) Shift back the search option back to how it was, for ease of understanding. Suggestion for feature: Add an option to be able to hide channels and their recommendations as most times they're not needed. Try to make it easy and better for older people as its hard for them to adapt that quickly when you're constantly changing things!",0
"Nowhere does it say that once you deleted the app on your phone, you won't be able to restore all the chats and data even if you installed the app on the same phone and the same number. After accidental deleting the app I've lost EVERYTHING that was kept their, all the precious data I use on the daily basis. And there's no way I could've known about it beforehand to switch to another messenger in time to keep all that more safely. Awful, misleading and useless app.",0
"I resent having to use this app at all, but even more than its market share I resent that every update seemingly makes it more annoying, ugly or bug-y. Runs well except for the seemingly random times where it completely dies on you, and gives you practically no control over privacy or appearance. If you have to switch devices kiss goodbye to your chat logs if you're unlucky. Bew features occasionally clearly copy better but smaller messaging apps. All in all a prime example of enshittification.",0
"Why are you changing all your designs? You had a great layout, great colouring and great colour blocking. And suddenly you change it all and it becomes a nightmare in white and you can't see where something ends and other things begin. Everyone liked the old design with the dark green. It was user friendly. The new version is not. I can live with the new layout. But the new design is bad and looks so weird and makes it harder to deal with the App, please change it back, old looked better",0
"It is not possible (on this phone) to keep contact lists seperate. WA collects every number, regardless of settings. In spite of this, when I block a number in contacts, it is not blocked in WA. Also, I can not delete WA from my phone's ""accounts"". It will pop up again no matter what I do, short of deleting WA. Receiving messages seems a bit random.",0
"I was initially excited to use Meta Ai but unfortunately, I've been experiencing a frustrating performance issue. Every time I open this, my phone starts working slowly and hangs. This is really disappointing, as I was looking forward to using the Ai regularly. The Ai itself seems to have some great features, but the performance issue makes it difficult to fully enjoy. I've tried closing other apps, restarting my phone, and updating the app, but the problem persists.",0
"After the latest update, when I use the back button, it takes me to the biometric login screen. I have biometric login enabled, but on opening the app, fingerprint, read message, press back button, I have to log in again. Turn biometrics off, I don't have the issue. And with them on, it only happens once as far as I'm aware, but it's really inconvenient.",0
"This app is quite useful and does its job, however the recent deseing and layout changes have been quite the downfall. Any other communication app with a decent design might just be able to take over. The colour changes are clashing with everything and the change of shade of green removes the trademark green of WhatsApp and the bars being moved from the top to the bottom was totally unnecessary. I'd give it 5 stars, but these changes are just awful. Nobody asked for it, just change it back.",0
"The new design is problematic. The toxic-green coloured send button is an eye sore and takes attention away from the actual chat, not to mention it doesnt go well with the calm, dark green present everywhere else. Additionally, the chat list lost it's readability with the lack of spacers separating the conversations. As much as I love minimalism, efficiency in being able to visually distinguish between rows of conversations should've stayed the priority.",0
"Moving navigation to the bottom is a bit disorienting because we're so used to have space at the bottom to touch or swipe but it's still not that bad. The new color scheme for light version where everything is now white with neon green is too bright, while the dark version using black instead of dark gray too dark. You're giving us two option that are way to extreme to either side. It's very bad",0
"The interface is as unstable that I changed the theme twice and went back to the last version, I can't really say everyone's opinions, but i can notice a global discomfort at the place changes, color and theme, and other functions. I know there's a huge team doing work begins but, really, is difficult to adapt at this new change. Hope this help improves the brand and the interface more.",0
"why does Whatsapp just keep getting worse??? firstly the status quality downgrade, and then the status lineup (instead of going vertically it's now placed horizontally, not to mention there's no discernible partition between your own status and others'). Instead of the statuses showing their recent content outwardly on their supposed profile pictures without having to click on them, it's now just people's profile pictures. The menu being moved to the bottom is distracting too. wish I can say mor",0
"The new update broke the fingerprint lock. Some times when I open the app I am able to unlock it, sometimes it doesn't work and you need to restart the app. And when you restart the app it might work or it might not. The way that the fingerprint lock worked before was better, there is no need to press a button to allow the fingerprint to unlock. Further more, some times it also asks you to unlock WhatsApp twice. This last update was generally unnecessarily.",0
"Im not sure what's wrong with this app, since the 2 latest android update. Everytime I received a new message from this app my phone slowed down, and sometimes froze. im using Samsung Flip 4, initially I thought the problem came from the phone, but I check with other people who are using different phone, and they are experiencing the same thing. Please fix this ASAP.",0
"Dear Meta, I hate to say this but the new themes and colors are so awkward. Why the switch from a warm midnight color to a much darker version? I get the need to increase contrast, but this feels quite aggressive and doesn't go easy on the eye. And the bigger waiting icon for unsent messages doesn't balance well with the spacing. First, you moved the menu to the bottom and that was okay, but this too? Nah. Too much",0
"We appreciate the service provided so far. But why are there all of these changes lately without allowing the user to choose what is most convenient for them? I was very comfortable with what WhatsApp was before. The interface, navigation bar and the theme. With the sense of privacy and how cosy it was. Now it seems to be changing towards something that is even becoming vulgar.",0
"The recent update includes several channels on that I'm not interested in & find irrelevant. Unfollow is not enough. It would be great if there was an option to hide or customize or block the channel list so I can focus on the content I actually enjoy. This would greatly improve my viewing experience. Additionally, it would be helpful to have more options to personalize the content I see, such as blocking specific types of shows or topics.",0
"This app has always been a nice app for messaging but recently, they keep changing everything. This last update is affecting me so much because I've not been able to put status updates since I don't know if am the only one experiencing this issue or what. If I try deleting a status update, it will stay up for 24 hours or more before it is deleted. Same thing as putting a new one Please, stick to one update and leave it for a long time not update every day.",0
"I have been using this App for years but there are some features that need attention, like image quality change! Even though I try to take good pictures their resolution always change to a poor quality resolution as long as I upload them, make it on profile or in chats! Even the ""channels"" part I wish it had a hide button for users like me who don't find interest in it. Another problem is that In this update I can nolonger edit messages after sending them! Yet it was a great feature. Thanks",0
"I honestly don't like the new update where the chat/calls/status bar is at the bottom. Please change it back to the previous design. Also, everytime I try to scroll down my stickers, it glitches and brings me back up, sometimes even while I'm pressing on a sticker, making me send the wrong one. I'd be very grateful if you could fix that and also bring back the old design, it was more enjoyable.",0
What is this non-sense !? Why are you changing the interface ?? Can't you tolerate the ease of access !? The previous interface was good and we all are habituated with that one. Now it is not that familiar like before. I love to use that interface - Navigations were at the top. Not the present one - Navigations at the bottom. You just add features more and more. We are really pleased with them. But please don't change the interface. I just want that interface back with a new update. Please,0
"UI/UX The app has a non-intuitive and old interface. The Community tab in the top-left part of the UI is small and hard to reach. Finally, viewing who viewed a message is also non-intuitive (swiping from the right of the message would be better). FEATURES Inability to share large files of any kind (mp4 , pdf...). Inability to clear individual private and group chats. Media quality. BUGS The profile picture failed to load; Default message timer had to be set manually for all contacts;",0
"The new feature where the chat, status bar, call are at the bottom of the screen is very inconvenient and unnecessary. Also why remove the swipe feature? The previous version was more user friendly. The new update is very pointless. Don't fix it if it doesn't need fixing. Please fix it as soon as possible. Please don't make this another Spotify story. Maintain your authenticity whatsapp, no need to follow trashy trends set up by other apps. The current layout is inconvenient.",0
"Whatsap app UI is fine with all the privacy 🔏. But even after changing the settings, My whatsap resets by itself deleting the two months or more data which is unpredictable without any prior notification or any information automatically gives me the screen of ""restore"" or ""skip restore"". If developer finds this message please try to clear the issue 😤. This is so bad. I had lost most of my data because of this. Not happy with this issue.",0
"The new UI is good on the surface, but for people with taller phones, it makes it difficult to reach the chats on the top and i have to move my entire hand to do so. This is especially annoying for chats which you have pinned and makes it counter intuitive since they should be easier to reach with just your thumbs. Please give us an option to revert the UI, or give us the option to make chats be pinned at the bottom of the screen instead of the top.",0
"It would be really good when sent images wouldn't be saved twice in the storage. One, it takes more space, second it makes decluttering harder since you practically need to delete all the images twice. Why are you making the app look so ugly. Now the top bar turned white too, and damn did that hurt my eyes when I opened the app.",0
Holding to record a voice message releases on its own 9 times out of ten. Listening to someone's voice message will turn the screen black when it detects an objet (or sometimes even without detecting anything) and switch from speaker to earpiece on its own which is extremely inconvenient and can't be disabled. Generally speaking playing back audio messages is a painful experience.,0
"App was good. Is good for just chatting. Sending links or videos not so good. They can't be opened. Have checked app permissions, security permissions and all are saying it should be able to open links. Still not able to. Contacted support, they keep closing the ticket claiming nothing is wrong and won't help solve the issue. The one message they did confirm was it is now run by meta and Facebook platforms on a business level.",0
"When a message is opened from the notification panel it doesn't ask for the biometrics, once I have seen/responded to the message and goes back to the whatsapp home screen it then asks for biometrics, very huge security flaw, I wonder what are your testers and quality control people are doing. Also this new UI is terrible, the search bar position is just awful let alone waste of space. Please fix these.",0
"The new UI is disappointing, putting the status-community-call bar at the bottom is bothersome because people rarely use it; to add on, the bar is so thick and bold that it's distracting. Can we please get the old UI back? Edit: the top and bottom part is white now, everything's white. Please just return to the old UI please please please (the status-community-call bar are still at the bottom too)",0
"My problem has to do with the fact that when you link devices of your own like a laptop or 2nd phone,you can't put anything on your status which is so annoying because it's your trusted device that you've linked it which is to serve the same purpose and so if you want to use your 2nd phone to post status when you're far away from your primary phone,then it becomes impossible. It's a nice platform though ,excellent in all ways",0
"The app has been great thoough. But since the latest updates they've been releasing this year, it hasn't really gone smoothly. Been having issues with app for about two weeks now, attimes I open the app and it my chats or status updates don't load up. Even had to delete the app and install it back and it has been initializing for God knows how long after I had opened it.",0
"The New Update is very annoying and frustrating due to Hanging issue while Video call, Delay in Voice. Always gets freeze, Hang and Voice no clear. Status sliding is not good due to the horizontal direction. The Vertical direction is much better for easy access of statuses. I hope that developers will do the needful and make more convenient interface without changing it more",0
"Formerly a really useful and simple app, WhatsApp has become so cluttered - both visually and functionally. It seems like WhatsApp doesn't know what it wants to be anymore. I hate the placement of the search tab and AI button. I suggest making it such that extra features can be disabled in settings.",0
"Hi. Suddenly I cannot send voice notes from my samsung watch4 anymore. Everything is updated, all permissions allowed, settings are correct. It used to work perfectly, now all of the sudden I cannot use this amazing feature of sending voice notes anymore. My phone sends it with no problem, but will not go through on my watch. Please fix this BIG BUG/ERROR asap",0
"I LOVE this.... BUT why take away our pop-ups??? This doesn't help me, let alone anyone else, by the looks of it. Please put the pop-up option back. It's easier for on the go, and for people who don't have time to unlock phone to go into the app... also, you HAVE to go online... sometimes we don't want others to know we've been online so can swipe right, or mark as read from the lock screen. You didn't even put this new feature in the ""What's new"" details...",0
"I've completely edited my comment since we're swapping new problems for the old ones (thanks for addressing the last). Perhaps, it is because I'm from a region where WhatsApp is used for texting primarily and seeing life updates on the statuses of people one actually knows and have met, that the instant reactions which are similar to instagram are quite inconvenient. The long aspect ratio of statuses is also inconvenient, especially when it gets in the way of reading a long caption.",0
"This app is floddes with bugs. Especially annoying is a bug where it always scrolls back up when you try to find a sticker further down your list, my friend has it as well. This bug appeared after they've changed the layout unnecessarily. Now they've changed the main layout to an even more inconvenient and ugly one and yes, the bugs still exist. It's really bothersome to see unneccessary and unwanted features no one asked for getting added and still having the same bugs unfixed for months.",0
"For approximately 2 years WhatsApp has a bug that causes text statuses to be written in left-aligned small-sized font after reaching a certain length. As a person who uses Arabic natively, I am compelled to refrain from posting a status whenever this weird left alignment behavior happens, because it makes reading & writing the status very difficult. Honestly, it pains me to know that WhatsApp intentionally designed statuses to make them not usable for people who write in right-to-left languages.",0
"Would be so much higher of a rating if it didn't use non-standard markdown to format its messages, with inconsistent support across platforms? I can't understand the desicion to almost use markdown, but randomly change a few things, like sure it might not need table support, but why change the syntax used just a little? I also really dislike that images MUST be downloaded. There's a preview of the image in the app, so clearly the data has already been sent in some capacity?",0
"Hey there, I just wanted to share my experience with the S23 Ultra. While it's a powerful device with great camera capabilities, I've been really disappointed with the quality of media when I post it. Whether it's pictures or videos, the quality seems to take a nosedive, making me look bad compared to my iPhone-using friends. It's not just a slight compression issue; it's significantly reducing the picture quality. Even iPhone 8s users seem to be getting better results. Hoping for improvement.",0
The app has outdated functionalities which do not offer an exciting experience as compared to the 'unofficial' GB apps. It doesn't offer privacy at all. For example when i want to view status without being seen by the sender. I also can't download profile pictures/status as in GB apps. I can't hide messages. With WhatsApp there's no option for colours. It is just a boring essentiality,0
"Awful design choice in moving the navigation bar to the bottom of the screen: - latest chats are at the top so focusing the menu there makes more sense - size of the bar is quadrupled, now obscuring functional screen space - it doesn't integrate with existing design and feels 'stuck on top' It seems like a trick to force users to accidentally click useless features like communities (not in any way fleshed out enough to be useful) and updates (just Instagram light?). Hoping for a fix soon",0
"The recent update where you can unlock whatsapp with all biometrics is troublesome to some extent. Like when the lights are turned off, i have to wait for a while before i can access the fingerprint option to unlock it. I think there should an option where you can select which biometric you wanna use at that moment to unlock whatsapp cuz during urgent situations it is really disturbing to wait for quite a while before you get to unlock your phone in the dark when it is unable to scan your face.",0
"This new update really annoys me. The navigation bars are at the bottom which is like an iPhone and I hate it. It was so much easier to see and press whilst at the top. And they changed the placing of stuff so communities used to be first then chat, updates and calls,communities are central and really annoying coz it's useless. It was better when it was compact at the side tge top of my screen looks empty and the bottom looks too full just vhamge it back to how it was I'm sure everyone agrees",0
"Well this app has been of a very good use to me until one time that l decided to go online but my new messages didn't pop up even though I had sufficient data. I thought it was a normal network thing but the next day, the same thing happened so l then had to purchase another data bundle even at that,my new messages still didn't show . I then had to check if it needed to be updated but no, it didn't. I had sufficient data and it also didn't have to be updated as well. Pls look into this. Thanks",0
"Both group chats and personal chats are all mixed up on one page and it's annoying and unorganized. I would prefer or give a suggestion to separate personal chats from group chats to make it organized and a neat home page, one more thing you should give us the access to personalize our own home page as we want. We need to personalize the menu bar and stuff. What's app has been always the same at least there should be a little bit of changes in it to make it fun. One more thing,",0
"Recent update with permanent search bar at the top was a very very bad design thought, I suppose. No one desired to waste their screen space like this as it's not used often. If you have hired anyone recently for revamping WhatsApp UI, kindly fire him ASAP. Feature Request: Please add a notification history inside the WhatsApp itself for viewing recent notification and redirecting to corresponding messages. Currently very difficult to handle someone's reaction or quote especially in groups.",0
"The recent changes in colour, icons etc is abysmal. It's not consistent with size, the green is too green and over-all looks like someone turned on ultra contrast settings on your phone. Why update it automatically without requesting user? It's too bad to look at now.",0
"The latest update has somehow managed to ruin the voice message feature and therefore, the whole experience. You go to press the record button, then speak, and when you play it back, complete silence. You guys are doing too much. Yes, from 4 to 2 stars. You're welcome. 🙄",0
"All new interface after update is very absurd,I know very well that the characteristic of the What'sApp menu display is very attractive, unique, and iconic, but in this update many functions are missing or only my cellphone is like this, for example: the edit chat feature, now it's not there on my device. I LIKE OLD VERSION OF WHAT'S APP",0
Latest update (April 2024) is a big UI fail. Moving the main chat list search from a title bar icon to an input box at the top of the list has resulted in search box not being available UNLESS the chat list has not been scrolled. It has also resulted in UI inconsistencies between the different views. VERY BAD.,0
"I have been using WhatsApp for almost a decade now. But the recent updates have made WhatsApp loose its charm and grace. Despite there being various aspects that can be improved and updated, I don't know why the developers keep changing the entire interface, which is the basic charm of WhatsApp. Just like there's a separate section for communities, there should be a separate section for group chats that aren't part of communicaties as well. Bring back the old interface, its more practical.",0
"The latest ux/ui additions are horrid.. The capitalization of the statuses doesn't really add any value and takes attention away from what's really going on, on the screen. The capitalization forces your attention to it when really these bits of information are optional. If I want to check the status of the current user I'm chatting with I can at my convenience the capital letter draws unnecessary attention to something which is moot in the chat work flow/experience",0
"The app overall has not so good performance but yes it was okay until the status issue popped up, like first I thought the issue was with the video but then I realized that Whatsapp has glitches. When I upload the status the video automatically become blur and same is the case with photos. I want you to give some attention to this issue. Thanks!",0
"Revert back to search button instead of field. The previous search button was very handy and comfortable to use without any sort of problems now it is really misplaced, first of all it looks ugly just beneath the WhatsApp logo and what's interesting is it's bigger than logo itself taking almost full width and other thing is we have to scroll back to top to access it, the previous search button was way more cool and elegant, whole UI change +5 but search button -∞",0
I really hate the fact that they removed the option to choose the quality of your photos and videos that are sent through the app. They compress them af and it doesn't matter I do a 4k video - it gets sent as a low resolution video without me having any control over the size. I can't send them as documents but that's just bs.,0
"I do enjoy using this app, but the new UI after the latest update is not great. The dark theme is too intense and strains my eyes, especially in a dark room. The bright font color contrasts too sharply, making it uncomfortable. Please consider reverting to the previous version. It was already good, so why change it?",0
"Your live location doesn't works, It is always stuck on a specific time, it's not real time, live location should be real time, it should be like we can see literally the person moving on map in a gap of every 3-4 seconds, like on Google Maps it happens, improve it, because your app is widely used, and this feature is to protect someone also when in danger, but it stucks so baaaaad that ir doesn't even moves a inch on map, even after waiting for 3-4 minutes of time, not even after reopening it.",0
"Navigation bar has moved. I hate it. Big, cartoon-like icons taking up a huge portion of the lower part of the screen. I use chats, and occasionally calls. I don't need the communites and updates buttons at all. At least when they were at the top of the screen they were out of my way. Please, please, please add an option to move them back. And ditch the big icons, they don't blend with the rest of the app at all.",0
"I'm really disappointed with this app when it comes to transfering over my chats from an old device. The transfer over WiFi feature doesn't work, complaining that I need to connect to the Internet even though I already am. Then when I try again I've used all the verification codes I can with my number so now I have to wait a few hours... This is really having me second guess whether I want to continue using this app.",0
Hate the new UI update. Looks bland but cluttered at the same time. Like an evolution backwards. Status update times are no longer there. Missing the classic green WhatsApp signature colors. I guess it's that time where things will be shoved down our throats again and we need to look for alternatives.,0
"This is the ugliest WhatsApp update ever!! There is more white than normal which makes it disturbingly bright and I personally don't use the dark mode feature on my phone for anything. The new look when you open the app makes WhatsApp look fake honestly. The only good thing is that the swipe feature is back, cheers to that. Definitely hate the interface, I agree with the others. Certain graphics are poor now, looked much better before.",0
"What's app new features are not feasible at all. The problems listed here by other users are common however one point none of them mentioned that one of the feature in privacy setting isn't working, even if we set status' privacy to ""visible to my contacts except"" it shows your status to even non contact persons. This is really insecure. I really hope it will be fixed soon.",0
"The recent change of colours and other features and designs of icons are extremely unpleasant to the eyes. With every latest update, it is only becoming more and more inconvenient for the user. The UI updates are of no good and serves no purpose. Updates must not be such that it creates a sense of uncomfort among the users. Please bring back the old green colour that was exclusive to WhatsApp.",0
"Lately, voice messages randomly stop playing mid-file. Also, sometimes when scrolling through media files in a chat an error message randomly pops up saying ""Download failed"" despite the files are all downloaded correctly and I can look at all of them. Dismissing the popup message crashes the whole app.",0
The recent updates are not so handy. The colour theme is sooo white it hurts the eyes.. it's like some white queen has bursted in the WhatsApp and now everything thing is just plain and white no colour nothing at all. It has become so monochromatic and monotonous. The search label at the top is very inconvenient once you scroll down you have to go all the way up to search any chat. The channel and status also being merged is not a good update at WhatsApp's part.,0
"I suggest having the option to toggle HD video calling on or off would be a fantastic feature for WhatsApp platform. This would allow users to adapt to their internet connection and device capabilities, ensuring a smoother and more stable video calling experience.",0
"Thanks for trying to improve the app. But . . . 1. The green colour is too deep. It is not nice. 2. Removing the Search icon from the top and merging it with the Meta AI app is not the best. If you scroll down and want to search for something else, you'll have to scroll all the way up again. It is boring!",0
Please change the colour of UI back to previous one it's litterally straining eyes ... That bright green colour sucks for real... On top of that you r litterally copying UI of Instagram putting search bar on top and navigation bar at bottom . Please change these all back to normal previous one . This is uncomfortable + no one needed it to get updated like this.,0
"It is starting to look really unappealing, and ugly every update makes it look worse the original WhatsApp looked so much better and there was no channels - hardly anyone uses the channels and you cannot remove it form you status area. Please stop changing WhatsApp and go back to the original that everyone loved and was used too.",0
Continuous changes in the user interface are very annoying. Image quality drops drastically when sending any image. Now the AI search button. I don't want to use WhatsApp for browsing the Internet. Please stop messing it up by adding unnecessary features.,0
"Had this app years, but suddenly, my notifications have stopped working. I've checked all my settings and even uninstalled and reinstalled them, losing all previous chat messages and it's still not working. it's so frustrating!",0
Everyone is able to access the new WhatsApp update features but even after updating my WhatsApp I am not able to see any changes to my WhatsApp version. It is still the previous version. I also tried to clear cache from the Google Play Store storage and my network is also good but still the latest version isn't available to me. All other apps which I am updating from Google Play Store are updating. But what's the issue with this app? Can anyone suggest some ideas to help me with this problem?,0
"I have to open the app to get any notifications. If I don't check what's app I miss out on a whole day of messages regardless of my notification settings for what's app being turned on. It's madness, I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it's just behaving the same 🥺",0
"why do we need meta AI in WhatsApp? I'm here to talk to family and friends, not an AI. Why does it grab your attention with the unnecessary search bar? Can you not just make a website for your AI and not put it into your other services or, at maximum, just make it a chat instead of it being shoved in your face in the search bar? no one asked or needed this. The chatting works as intended and gets the job done though.",0
This new update with redesigned icons and colors look horrible and unnecessary. This is a shame to be very honest. You'd expect this from an amateur UI Designer. And to think I wanted to take the Meta course on UI/UX. Meta can do better. Way better than this ugly looking interface.,0
"A very useful app but the recent style change is disappointing. Changing the navigation bars to white, the same colour as the messages, just makes it all a little bit more visually confusing.",0
The image sharing experience is abysmal. The images do not get sent in the selected order and get sent in a jumbled way which makes it inconvenient for the receiver to decipher the order. The images which are selected should be able to be sent and downloaded by the receiver in the same order if the image/video count is large. The images should also be able to be forwarded in the same order as received.,0
A major position glitch of '+ Add to video call' green bar at the bottom appears right above a contact number or name who you may not intend to join to the ongoing WhatsApp Group video call! Often while pressing the green bar the contact just underneath it gets joined! This is often a cause of great embarrassment! Does anyone else face this situation?,0
"Please stop adding unnecessary updates. I mean why would you remove the ability to swipe from chats to status!? Especially when we're so used to it now, it's really inconvenient. Putting the titles at the bottom wasn't bad, just please take back the swiping. And if you can, please make another page for groups only, the mixing really isn't nice when you have a lot of groups",0
Why did you change the app. I liked it the way it was without the AI or the amount of green added. I am very disappointed with whatsapp. The app in my opinion is just trying trying to change like every other app now a days. I like how whatsapp was when I was growing up but now it just isn't it. I know alot of people feel the same way about it .I hope you know that it's not that I dislike the app or some changes that were added but I think you are going overboard with the updates. Thank you.😔,0
It used to work amazingly until the new update 1) The change of search bar to scroll is really inconvenience as we have to scroll up every time for a new chat. 2) The new theme is like gross and puts a lot of strain to eyes I wish whatsapp was just like the previous one.,0
Not getting the OTP on mobile for registration. And it keeps on saying to wait for sometime before trying again. But the screen is also stuck on the waiting for OTP page. This is really bothering and not expected behaviour.,0
"I dont like the new updates, the feel is different not sure exactly what it is a font, font size or bolded text or something else but it doesnt look like whatsapp no longer and I dont mean about moving status updates to bottom thats fine. Doesn't look simple, looks like a layer of something was added up and Im hating i! 👎🏼",0
"I can't view a video I posted on my own status without it glitching halfway as if I'm viewing someone else's status without data connection. Also, this new update is so annoying. Why has everything been moved around? I have to scroll forever to meet the status section. Why??? Please bring back the old version. Now I had to come back cause it keeps getting worse. Audios in statuses now begin seconds before the video motions. Why??? There's a whole lot of bugs to be fixed here",0

"This app needs a built-in text translation function. Every other similar app has one. It's annoying to have to open a 3rd party app to translate a message, but that's what we are forced to do if you want to read a message in a language you don't know. Groups can have people from many backgrounds. I've seen Polish, German, Spanish, Mandarin, French, Belarusian, Finninsh, etc. in some of the groups I'm in. I can read the Spanish, but the rest require another app to be able to read. Annoying.",1
Would give 5 stars but... The app really needs a built-in translator. It is very annoying to always have to copy tab out open Google translate and tab back in. It really kills the vibe of conversations when you have to constantly go back and forth. On top of top sometimes the biometric security does work. Same with the pin. I have noticed that sometimes I can enter the app without requiring a fingerprint or pin. That happens to me if I minimize the app and not close it.,1
"Too many bells and whistles The app could really do without: 1. The channel features. No one I know uses it. Simply add a turn off function. 2. As of yesterday, even though I have Meta AI option turned off it's now in that annoying search bar that I can't get rid of. 3. Please put the search bar back to where it was. Thar little magnifying 🔎 option at the top. Search bar takes up too much space. 4. There is a glitch when you slowly schroll to find a text from the previous day. Goes 2 far.",1
"What happened to Fingerprint Authentication? It's GONE! Got up today and it has disappeared overnight. Now, not an option .. will not turn on. As I've experienced with other software, an ""update"" degrades service and has unintended consequences. My fingerprint sensor works fine, otherwise. So, now that the app is basically unsecured, I won't use it until it is working again.",1
"I like using this app but this last update is awful!. it includes things like location and poll ? 😳 which I have no idea what they're talking about but the photo location is moved so I have to search. Also, on the stickers, it used to be if you put in a word such as ok or thanks it would bring some up to choose from. not as many as Wechat had but now I have to search thru stickers too. If its not broke dont fix it!",1
"The recent UI update has improved the overall aesthetics of the application. However, there is a minor adjustment that could further enhance its visual appeal. Specifically, increasing the spacing between the ""WhatsApp"" title and the search bar would create a more balanced and symmetrical layout. This adjustment would be particularly beneficial on larger devices, such as the Samsung S24 Ultra, where the current design appears cramped and lacks visual harmony.",1
when you are trying to scroll up slowly it pushes me too far fix that. add options or just make the audio send with name embedded to it this only works if you choose to send audio as document only {{this is important to the receiver to help navigate easily in file manager or audio player}} suggestion: can you consider to sperate chats amd groups to be in separate tabs the chats sometimes get mixed up you realize you have responded to an inbox days or hours later. this can really be helpful.,1
"This has been a great app, best messaging app by distance. But it can be greatly improved upon. I still wonder why the developers have left it this boring I have used GB whatsapp in the past, it's a hundred times better. I don't need all the features in GB integrated here, but at least, some useful ones should be. Like the following; 1. Option to change the default display menu colours, and outlook style. 2. The option to separate individual chats from group chats.",1
"Writing a review so that whatever bug that needs fixed will get fixed. I used to have perfect playback for voice messages but now it stops at twenty or more places while I'm trying to just simply listen to a voice message. It happens when I'm using my phone and when I'm not using my phone, just letting it sit on the counter. I really love using this app but would really like that to be worked out.",1
"The sticker interface is buggy. Every time I scroll to get to the sticker I want it glitches me back to the top and I have to wait a few seconds to be able to peruse the Favorites category freely. That and if I want to spam stickers, it's hard to do so cause every time I tap on a sticker, no matter what category, it sends me back to the top, which is annoying. Sometimes when I'm in the interface, the message interface bugs out and all I see is the background, not the latest messages.",1
Whatsapp for the phone works well but I am disappointed in the Galaxy Watch version. I sometimes have issues linking my device. My main issue is staying linked. I could be linked for a week maybe two. Then it drops so I don't even get any notifications. Makes the app pretty useless if I have to go through this song and dance every couple of weeks.,1
Edit Reduced the stars because of recent updates like status and search which ruined my pleasant experience . Having a search bar on top of chats is annoying .Search is not a feature I use everyday.So seeing that Bar all the time on the top is frustrating Love this app. Use it all the time to chat with friends and family.Voice messages are a plus. Only feature I miss is ability is sorting options I have to scroll to top one by one from bottom and its annoying.Overall gr8 app,1
"I have been unable to back up my chats since 18th April. The backup size also keeps increasing everytime I start it anew, and it has currently reached 1.1 gb. My Google account has auto-sync turned on, whatsapp is fully updated too. The bar stays full at 100% for hours, but the backup never uploads, with a message showing ""Google storage experiencing issues"" when it stops. I have done the recommended procedures in the app, but nothing is helping. Please look into this matter",1
"Fingerprint Sensor is misfunctioning each and every time I open the app. This is making me losing interest to use the app. Kindly solve this as quick as possible. In regard to bottom menus, am very satisfied with the new design and it looks perfect in my eyes. Am enjoying using the menus from the bottom. Another bad thing is the appearing of call log in chats, to me this makes the appearance of chats to be poorly presented due to the mix up of these different services. Work on this urgently.",1
"Please remove the AI widget line / type in section from above the chats, it's annoying and useless and makes it harder to navigate. Or include an option to turn it off in setting for those who don't like having AI in their basic chatting app. Thanks. P.S. the older design of app navigation was better when call chats etc were at the top of the app window.",1
"I will give you five stars when you bring this cool features, (according to me): 1. Separate Chats and Groups. 2. Have a Status Saver feature but for privacy purposes and security of the sender of the Status, have a feature whereby a person can set a status free so that people can be free to save it and also lock a status so that no one can save it. Just let the user say which status they are comfortable when people save it, instead of not having the Status Saver feature at all. Thank you.",1
The latest update is disappointing to say the least. It has bugs and the app lags alot. The apps UI is looking slick but the UX is not that smooth or friendly anymore. When trying to unlock 🔓 the app via fingerprint the app displays a white box with the verification icon and takes a few tries to unlock the app which is very very frustrating 😤,1
"Format/position of features/icons - better before new updates. WhatsApp was always smooth/easy to navigate/easy on the eye. New reductivist graphics include gaudy high contrast colours & basic, harsh looking icons, with no appeal. It's not great for visual issues. Indications - moves towards a budget version aesthetically in terms of previous user friendly appeal. Conversely, whilst the new budget look is a kind of 'shrinkflation' greater commercialisation is profit driven. Not keen. Concerned..",1
"The messaging features work as expected. I hate the recent UI changes, including the new colour scheme, which is plain and ugly and boring. No one needs a big ol' search bar across the top when the magnifying glass button worked perfectly fine. Developers may like to ask, ""Can we do this?"" and then try to do it, but someone should also be asking, ""SHOULD we do this?"" It makes me wonder which ""sponsor"" asked for it. Also, I don't want the AI thing. Let me turn it off.",1
It does it works but there are some annoyances that appear. I have two phones and they act like two different accounts. Some messages appear only in the old (without a sim) and some in in the newer phone. It does not work to link them with the QR-code. Second is that the checking for new messages notification icon goes crazy sometimes. Checking and popping up every second,1
"Terrible design choices in the new update. I don't know what the designers were thinking, but the color choices for the dark theme are really questionable. That aside I think the more criminal thing is the fact that they've changed the icons for attachment and photo buttons, maybe even for the emoji one, but I can't find an old screenshot. All in all I'm just here to complain abt the design cuz it's really bothering me, and many others I can assume.",1
Why couldn't they keep the green theme? At least as an option? Now I have to choose between eye-strain white light theme (my screen brightness is turned down to the absolute minumum and it still burns) or fall asleep deep grey dark theme. I hate this. The green was perfectly fine and easy on the eyes. Just a hint dearest app devellopers of the modern internet: your apps really do not have to look exactly like everything else. Uniqueness is a good thing.,1
"Used to be a simple 5-star messaging app, but just had an update that has made my screen all high-key bright white and Im finding it very hard on the eyes, the all white or all black in dark mode is just too much. It was much better with the green banner at the top and a less intensely bright screen. Also, I dislike the newer features with channels and ""updates"", which means that I see a notification at the bottom to show me something I dont want to see and I cant hide these.",1
"The new search bar equal to the screen size is good. It appears at the top of the chat but when you scroll down on all the chats then that option goes missing and you have to scroll up to search for anything. Please make sure the search option is visible even when we are at the bottom of all the chats we have done. It will make any search easier, instead of scrolling back to the top again and then searching for anything particular. The previous search option was always visible and usable.",1
"Great up until now. When I go to reply to a message, usually the messages will scroll up so you can see the last message as you're typing. As of this week, this no longer happens, I have to manually scroll to the last message in that chat. I have uninstalled the same issue there. Also reached out to tech support, and they said they could help with message queries 🤷‍♀️",1
"In Android, the recent update had changed the colour of the top from dark green to pure white with a light green logo, and also moved the navigaton buttons from the top to bottom, which really piss me off. I loved that so much as it's so convenient and delighting. I really miss the original interface.",1
"Good app, Please add some features, like transparent and other colors view in both chat and Home page, bubbles, and fonts customization. Also separate groups with other chats. Sometimes chats need to be replied urgently, when they are mixed with groups, it sometimes can be seen easily. Take care of that, This app will be so amazing. Thank you!!",1
"WhatsApp is my go to messaging app, I use it for almost everyone I speak to and the video call and group chat features are still great. However, this update feels like the developers are trying to *change* it rather than improve it. It's altered things that didn't need fixing, and I agree with previous reviewers that the buttons at the bottom of the screen are more of a downgrade when it comes to usability.",1
"Moving the navigation panel to the bottom is useless. WA status - one of the feature in navigation panel - is not a feature that we use frequently. This new location interferes the swiping area of the important perimeter. In addition, we already were able to move through panel just by swiping the screen to left or right. So, please just move the navigation panel back to the top.",1
"Some recent features are increasing user inconvenience. 1. The search button has changed to a search field at the top. Now if I want to search something when I have scrolled to the bottom, I have to scroll all the way back to the top to search. Please revert to the search button, not field. 2. The status and channels page have been merged. Now there is very little interest to scroll all the way to the right to see one's status. Please separate both - status and channels as separate pages.",1
"The Search tab on the latest UI update is really misplaced. There is no padding on the top and bottom, and it deviates from the chats screen unnecessarily. A button on the top right was enough imo. Hope the team looks into this and restores it, not that the app appearance changes have been convenient otherwise, but this one is absolutely redundant. Thank you.",1
"The app is great. Fast and reliable. But for some reason, my WhatsApp isn't updated. I have uninstalled and reinstall, logged out and logged back in but I don't have the Update tab. It's still the Status tab so I can't view channels. I have also updated, just today but I didn't have the new features like uploading one minute status. Can you fix this please.",1
"Gold standard for messaging these days, but the developers need to stop messing around, changing things up. Placing the search bar at the top of the chat across the entire UI, underneath the top bar that says WhatsApp, and has the camera and menu button? Why can't it just be an icon there? That's an abomination right there. And it's not just an eye sore, now there's less space for chats. It's not even spaced well, with the top of the search bar flush with the title bar. Nonsense I say!",1
"Very good app, but I'd like to see some improvements in it.. 1. Turning off read recipts for only one chat, like one individual chat not all of them. And also turning off the ""last see"" of an individual chat. I think it adds a nice touch to the app, and gives us control of who can see what and who can contact us in a way. But all in its a good app and effective 🩷",1
"It's been a good experience since the birth of WhatsApp but the resent update has some new features that I feel is ""a spot on the white"". 1. The new position of the menu makes it look clumsy. 2. We use to see someone's status without opening it before now; that was better. 5. One can no longer view the number of members who left a group. Sometimes, it's really needed. 6. Most importantly, when you call a contact, it shows ""ringing"" even when the receiver is offline. That can cause troubles.",1
"I basically think WhatsApp is a perfect messaging service, but the calls leave a lot to be desired. Almost every call I make on WhatsApp has a noticeable delay, which leads to people talking over each other. Very frustrating. There are also major concerns for me over how my data is stored and shared with third parties, so I am considering switching to Signal. Hopefully the calls on that are smoother.",1
"The interface just changed. The headings on top are no longer. I used to be able to swipe left to go from chats to status to calls. Now there are no more headings. I tried creating a written story, and can't do that anymore. Revert back to how it was yesterday, please. Are you guys bored; trying to create work? These types of unnecessary changes can cause an exodus of long-time users.",1
"The new graphic is too white and bright... There was no need to change it. Get rid of it! Also, could you please default profiles with no photo with some sort of colour-background and maybe the contact's initials? I hate that stupid grey silhouette. You've been copying Telegram so well, you might as well do it properly.",1
"Too many changes in a short span of time. Over the past year and half WhatsApp has become slightly more buggy. 1. Bugs like a status audio continues playing after I've closed it. 2. Makes uploaded video or image quality horrendous from my S22+ even when I have taken care to drop image size. 3. The new search bar looks misplaced, certainly looks like a bug, why change it from the icon anyway? 4. Channels? Not sure if this is the next twitter or what",1
Please keep the original design the old format with the green bar at the top looked good. I don't have an interest in the visual updates that aren't necessarily making the app more efficient. I loved the original design. Great app I've been using it for years. More simple and user-friendly than most messaging apps. Please don't make too many changes.,1
Whatsapp is a very essential app and it has been of help when it comes to communication. I've used it over time but I have a little complaint. I've updated the app countless times and yet I don't see much that is being updated. I really wish that groups will be put differently and not interfere with chats. It makes the app look disorganized. Thank you.,1
"Title: Disappointed with WhatsApp's Interface Overhaul As a long-time user of WhatsApp, I must express my disappointment with the recent update that has drastically changed the app's interface. The decision to shift the call, update, and chats option bar to the bottom of the screen is not only disorienting but also inconvenient. One of the primary issues with this update is the lack of usability. The previous interface was intuitive and easy to navigate",1
"Enhanced the application, Much better than the previous experience. But still need improvements. Add the following options: 1. Separate the groups and community tabs for chats. 2. ""Goto first message"" option in chats. 3. ""Message a number"" option in home page's 3 dot menu to message any number without saving. 4. Transfer media from the other mobile. I transferred the data to new mobile but I didn't get the media that I had in my previous phone.",1
"I've been having a very strange problem. I've not been able to send message on some WhatsApp groups. Not that they set it to only admins can send messages, but open groups. The message just won't send and this is strange. It doesn't do like this in the other groups I'm in on my phone, I've checked. And yes, I'm on the latest version of WhatsApp",1
"I like the app overall however, I've had a massive issue; the app does not show status updates of server downtime. Today there has been an issue where I could not send or receive messages and calls however it was working for others so I thought the issue was with me, but I could not backup my data due to the issue but I still decided to uninstall and reinstall it and now I can't log back in and I'm going to lose all my previous messages. I'm extremely disappointed.",1
"This application used to be good because of being esay, functional and well-performing. But for now, it is getting more bloated, privacy invading, and takes longer time to open and interact with the user. The Channels and Community features are redundant. Additionally, I highly suggest to put folders feature to put multiple chats in a folder.",1
"the very latest update that changes the tone of the green icons is quite uncomfortable for me. i think all users were fine with the previous tone of green. also, please add a dark mode theme option that is just pure black like the dark mode on twitter or youtube. will appreciate that a lot. just maybe stop redesigning features that are already functional and just add small features that are optional.",1
"New design is horrible, they replaced the nice and calming minty green to some putrid, vomit inducing one. Also the darkness of the grey in dark mode has gotten darker causing it to clash with the text bubbles and message bar. I'm no design expert but it looks sad. Other than that, it works absolutely fine as an app though I would appreciate if they could bring the old design back as I now have to see this sickly one everyday.",1
"Whatsapp is the best app to message and video call your friends and family. It can also do voice notes which is easier when you can not type. It also doesn't waste that much data so I recommend people to download this app worldwide ☺️ New update***And please when u are updating please don't forget to add filters to video calls and can u remove the ""this message was deleted"" 😭and fix the damn quality 🙏😭😑it's ruining the quality of our videos n pictures",1
"The most recent update has addressed several issues I encountered, yet the decision to alter the dark mode color from dark green to neon green was ill-advised. Previously, dark mode featured a nuanced shade of green that complemented the interface well, but now it appears as solid black. I would appreciate it if the color palette were reverted to its original state.",1
"Apparently impossible to contact support with feedback or a bug report. Typical Meta, making themselves indispensable while and not caring a jot about user experience. It's impossible to see dates while scrolling back through a chat, if the chat has a pinned post. Yes, pinning is a fantastic new feature but this means it takes with the left hand while giving with the right - more nuisance than useful.",1
"I like the new updates. The interface is just wow. The introduction of Meta AI is a great improvement. Recently, you introduced a setting that one could have two accounts on the same app. And I have. However, the Mata AI feature appears on one account only. The other account-which is my dearest- does not show the feature. How could I fix this- or it's how it has been developed?",1
"I'm consistently bothered about the voice and video call operation, there's no telling the difference whether the person being called is online or offline...make so that when the other person is offline it'll indicate that ...not the same ""ringing"" indicator on the call screen. At leastake 2 different indicators, ""dialing"" or ""calling"" when attempting to connect and ""ringing "" when connection is established. The current state is VERY MISLEADING!",1
"I had the feature showing when my call is switching from ""calling"" status to ""ringing"" status. With that feature I was able to know if the person I'm calling is really receiving my call or it stacks on calling when the person is not reachable (no internet connection or phone is switched off etc). Since 2 days I don't have this feature anymore.. and all calls are by default ""ringing""",1
"PLEASE STOP CHANGING THE INTERFACE FOR THIS APP. The new update is a sensory overload and NOT visually friendly. Making this all white is painful to navigate. The simplicity of the green bar highlighted conversations and made it easy on the eyes and easy to read. Now everything is white it's an overload and uneasy. When you create these new layouts why on make it an option ""Classic or New"". Why is WhatsApp now looking like my email inbox. HAVE LAYOUT OPTIONS INSTEAD. Stop changing it frequently!",1
"I'm just disappointed. Yesterday I almost waste my 2 hours solving this app's issue. Firstly my messages weren't sending and then after reinstall the app just became mad. No contact was showing at that time. Then I came to know this is happening to a broad number of people not only me. After next day I install and everything is okay but too much slow, it's not showing some contact's profile picture, not showing some contact's last seen and many more. What th is going on!! Please fix the bug.",1
"Dear Meta, stop playing around with the UI. It looks almost like an intern designed it and released by accident. I believe most people talk to the same 3-4 chats, meaning theres's no reason for the search bar to occupy an entire row. I'd in fact prefer not having to use the search bar; Just have my most used/ recently used chats appear on top, which WhatsApp already does and that's enough. Please put the search button back where it was before, don't make us scroll all the way up for it.",1
"Ok the issue at hand is that WhatsApp is not well optimized for flagship android phones. Unlike Apple where they have a set of phones and its easier to optimize I think that better optimization should be done for flagship androids at least. For ex. When sending a picture, not from the gallery but instant ones, the quality is immediately just done for, compared to IOS where it stays sharp and consistent. Please if there is a workaround find it because its embarrassing for is android users.",1
"The recent update to WhatsApp has introduced some frustrating limitations. One of the most notable drawbacks is the inability to check whether the person you're calling has their data turned on. Additionally, the lack of a feature to see if someone is already engaged in another conversation adds to the frustration. These changes disrupt the smooth communication experience",1
"I am a frequent user of WhatsApp and find the status feature to be a great way to share moments with friends and family. However, I have noticed that the current status upload quality is limited to a lower resolution. I kindly request that WhatsApp consider implementing a feature that allows users to upload status updates in high definition (HD) quality. This would greatly enhance the viewing experience and allow for more detailed and clearer images and videos to be shared.",1
"Hate the new WA. I feel like the last update was better. I don't like the pages going to the bottom, it looks like every other app now. It used to have a unique look and feel to it. Updating the system makes sense, but the way every other month we're getting a new look, is honest giving me a whiplash. Thankfully, the chat features are somewhat the same.",1
"Your interferface has always been boring. Not going to lie! Taking for instance, all third party apps have this amazing and impressive interface that allows it users to tweak as far as they want but reverse is this but I believe you can do better. Why not just adapt all these features this third parties have into this and trust me people like me that goes for them would definitely come back to you without thinking twice. Although, I give credit to your unwavering efforts",1
"When receiving calls, WhatsApp now automatically reduces dialling tone to 0! Hence, unless you hear the initial tone, you miss the call! My 87 yo mother was also just ""put"" on the AI Beta program. In her case, there is no longer a pop-up to allow her to answer the WA call... and she cannot see who is calling her. Please stop messing with the User Experience - as it is getting much worse!",1
"Overall great application. But I don't think it's fair that people using the other versions of the application have way better experience than people who are using the actual app, such as the ability to translate a message, flight mode, and ghost mode, talkless of their ability to change the theme, and even have a local chat backup. Please look into these",1
"Suggestions: We prepared using GB WhatsApp because of some of it's features, which are very interesting. Features like: - Status Saving. - Status Copying in case of written one. - Status are Reusable by the viewer (s). - Quick Online Status Notification - Preview Option: one can preview a picture/video sent in chart, without saving it in your phone. -etc. So I'm advising you people that you should kindly look into this matter to add some features similar to that of GB WhatsApp.",1
"I've noticed a recurring issue while scrolling through chats on WhatsApp, and it's not just isolated to one device – it occurs on my other phone as well. Sometimes, as I attempt to scroll up to review previous messages, the chat unexpectedly jumps or teleports to a random point further up the conversation, even when I haven't scrolled excessively. This glitch is too frustrating. Please solve it.",1
"It's good app indeed. But I would advice to add the tab for *groups*. It should be separated from general chats and have its own tabs. That will be easy to sort the individual chats and those from groups. Secondly, you should extend the time for status, it should be more than 30 seconds, as well as ability to download other people's status.",1
I was just using the AI feature on WhatsApp and was really happy with the response but it took me forever to just type out a single response. I would have loved to continue that but couldn't handle the slow working of it. It would have been great it I didn't have to deal with hangs with such big app like you guys are used over the world. Don't give so much updates and feature but the least you could do is to keep it easy and smooth for user.,1
"As an app it is very useful to me but due to lack of pop-up notifications when someone calls voiceor video, I have had calls missed. The issue seems to be with android phones which are running Android 10 or above. I did raise a service request but it seems the techsupport are not interested in resolving issue.",1
"I've been using WhatsApp for as long as I've had a phone and in all that time it's been good and running smoothly with some minor hiccups here and there that didn't cause any alarm but recently your new updates have been really annoying(for lack of better words) eg. When I call someone and they are offline it shouldn't say ringing it should just say ""calling"" until I stop calling not this new one that says ""ringing"" even when the person you're calling is offline or not connected wifi or data. Ty",1
"I can no longer open links from Facebook that contacts send on WhatsApp. It just opens to a black page with a spinning wheel. I've never had a problem until the past few months. Nothing I've found online helps. In settings it says that open verified links is checked off, but it only shows 7 verified links which is all WhatsApp, and there seems to be nowhere to add more verified apps",1
"The most used app, easy simple. But the recent updates are not much appreciatable, mean the channels, interface etc. Because it was different from othe social apps like fb,insta until latest updates. Still i suggest some features to be added, 1. To view groups separately 2. To turn off forwarding messages 3. Account auto deletion option. Hope for the better updates.",1
"I've been using WhatsApp for a very long time now, and I've not had any issues with it. But recently I discovered that my WhatsApp now hangs(not all time though). When this happens it takes about 2 days to rectify itself. This makes it very difficult to use the app, as it keeps on saying force close. I've tried updating the app, but still, there are no changes.",1
"The app is very good and useful.. It has many new features that help us to have a safe and private conversation. But peronally from few days i am continuously facing many problems on the app firstly, about the quality of the vdios goes worst if we send it to someone thought the new feature of hd is good but it is not available for all vdios and photos. The next problem is about the status which we upload after uploading a vdio the quality goes worst.These problems should be seen once to improve.",1
WhatsApp was my preferred messaging app. Too much has been changed now. All white? Why? Please just make it the green it was before. The channels feature should be optional for people who don't want it. Why are there so many changes without consideration for the users. Calls don't come through when my phone is locked. Messages also get delayed or don't come through.,1
"Hi Meta So i find a few things quite disturbing for instance the screenshotting of profile pictures that has been used against me. And I ( and other people) would suggest for an update to add a request bar for unknown people to text you, for instance the people who isnt on your contacts should request to the people they want to text to talk on Whatsapp. That would be much appreciated. So just a recap: 1. Request bar for unknown contacts",1
"It's a good app, very useful and dependable. The new updates are annoying and unnecessary though. The communities are useless and the update bar being at the bottom makes it uglier. The new shade of green looks horrible in light mode and too bright in dark mode. I preferred it before the updates.",1
"Used to be great before, easy, lightweight chat and call app. Since Facebook ""Meta"" took it, it just gets worst bit by bit. I used to be able to be in call and watch videos now I cannot for unknown reason. The app is slowly becoming some kind of social media app with its video updates and stuff. The more features they will add the more good things they will eventually start to cut on, because that is what they do, they want more clicks... It is still a good app but for how long...",1
"The worst problem currently is that uploading any picture of higher resolution on status , automatically gets reduced to lower quality (poor). When others see the status it is blur. I think on uploading status ,quality of picture must be same ( high resolution) . There should be option of HD for status also which is available on sending pics. It should be fixed soon. Thank you..",1
The WhatsApp AI is quite annoying it types alot of things when one just wants a simple conversation. If it could be programmed to atleast converse almost like one of us i think that would be better... it feel like every conversation with it is an interview. And I don't like the appearance of the AI circle... I wish it's just as green as everything else.,1
"This is a really great app. It wouldn't be good if I were to criticize it because it's just great. Although, I do have a suggestion. Wouldn't it be nice if we consumers had the chance to group chats into categories or folders and name those folders/categories. For example, grouping important chats together and picking them from the less important ones. Think about it. I reckon it is a very nice prospect.",1
"After new update, unlock by biomatric moved fingerprint to face id. Which is so irritating when you're in dim lights specially at nights. And you can't move to fingerprint by your choice, you have to stay with the face id which doesn't work properly in dim lights so you have to face problems when you're in hurry. What a wastage of updates!!!!",1
"The recent updates are awesome and specially the Ai features is so nice . I am facing a issue for many years that I can't forward a video/audio/documents,files until first i download it as my self then I can forward to others, its irritates so hardly , Developers need improve the service ...",1
"The newly entire white background in the Title Bar is missing the contrast in the display. Also too much white color has increased the battery usage of the App (though there is a black theme, but not everyone likes the dark theme).",1
My WhatsApp keeps removing everytime my data is turned on 😞 it makes it hard to send messages as I have to turn off my data and turn back on when I have finished typing my message so the WhatsApp does not close and I have to start from the beginning The app when my data is on will suddenly turn dark and take me back to my phone's home screen Please I hope you can fix this problem it is very uncomfortable 😣😖,1
Hi. Whatsapp is good and all but I'm not happy with some of the updates. The greeness for one and the fact that the icons were moved to the bottom. I also noticed that my unread chats stopped counting and it's plus that's there. I need it to count thank you. The change of the font also bothers me.,1
The New feature which shows the Status Bar (Online/Offline) in White colour background is not suitable. It is not clear for viewing for the User. Please change back the Status bar colour to Green colour background as it is much more clearer to view the Online/Offline Status. Thank you.,1
"For this new update, you need to fix the issue around users not being able to connect back to the call when another call comes in. It shows call on Hold, but you can not see the option to resume the call. You will then be forced to end the call and redial your contact. Please do wel to fix this defect ASAP",1
"The app is fine, it works as intended. I just wanna know who thought it would be a good idea to make everything that ugly shade of green. Every time I open the app, it makes me physically gag. I just constantly feel the need to throw up. It hurts my eyes how unappealing this green is. My disappointment is more than unmeasurable, and I will forever be bothered by this. Do better 😔",1
"I liked the old format much better, all these recent changes were really unnecessary. And it seems like the color has totally vanished and the screen looks so.....white😬 And the status viewing part has just become a whole another headache...",1
"The calls keep cutting in and out after awhile of being on it, it like it's laggy and I know for fact it isn't my wifi. it gets worse when it's on video calls too. Do what you will with this but I hope this problem gets improved on because it really dissatisfies the experience.",1
"This app very useful for me. I like it. It will be better if you add (Enter ↩) option in status posting. Currently this option is not applicable when posting. And one thing more, if we could allign our text in center, left or right when posting in status. It will be more useful. Thanks",1
"The vibrant green that WhatsApp was known for has been replaced with more of neon green in android, which some users find less distinctive and lacking in character. Additionally, the new colors may not be as visually appealing to certain individuals or may not resonate with their personal preferences.",1
All feature are ok. But the finger lock feature is a bit irretating.. As it takes longer time thn before to detect. And finger is removed quickly it doesn't opens and remains in the same screen. Thts a bit irretating as if anyone who wants to open wpp in urgent cannot do so.,1
I don't like the new look of WhatsApp from this latest update to have it all white (light theme). I see that we can choose from dark to light theme now. The problem is that using the dark theme also make the wallpaper photo in my chat too dark. I would like if there was a third theme to choose the original green look.,1
I've always liked WhatsApp on the whole but the latest update has made the UI look sparce with minimal definition - like it's operating in some kind of bare-basics 'safe mode'. Change for the sake of change as always!,1
Generally good but much worse on Android than it is on iPhone. Things like the messages vibrating in silent mode while the chat is open was a life saver but now I need to keep my sound on so I can hear messages from the conversations I have open without staring at my phone the entire time.,1
It's been great so far but the only thing l am not comfortable with is the current position of status. It used to be vertical but currently its in horizontal position making it inconvenient for viewing to me.,1
"After years of using this, the latest updates plus with the Meta A.I, i found it especially the Meta part, why do you guys need to put up with that..? It's really a BIG nuisance and please kindly remove the group part where we are given choices whether to follow or not, it does not serve any purposes at all. Just leave it simple as it is and we don't mind if you want to make the apps, Whatsapp theme especially that's the nicest part but please improve the video call quality, it's been years..!",1
"WhatsApp..We are happy with your app..It is a very useful and valuable app .. But for those of us who use it, the only inconvenience is showing the group in the chat list itself. It makes us feel very uncomfortable. Please consider this request. We look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you.",1
I personally didn't like the updated colour. Its very strange. I think it wouldn't be a big problem to give a option to pick colour and where we want the search in settings menu,1
"With the latest update app lock is frustrating. Also some of the bugs are also remaining from many months. Like when I choose photo to send someone I'm unable to choose filter, same issue on status too. The filter sheet is not opening properly.",1
Great App always has been but seriously guys the new update colour theme especially is absolutely atrocious looking! Please give us at least the option to either keep the original or change to the new colour theme before you loose many & I do mean many valuable loyal long term trustworthy customers! Please 🙏🏼 give the option a consideration much appreciated always 🙏🏼 ☘️💚☘️,1
I would like to give a suggestion to Whatsapp as you should add up a time schedule for sending messages as we do business work so aren't always available on the point time to message our employees so this could make up to us. The idea for Message scheduling in whatsapp for sending messages. Rest the app is good but do add this feature as it will be very helpful.,1
Well everything is fine! But I hate the fact that the app is automatically reading the messages and suggesting possible answers for reply(from the notifications) then how come you guys are promoting end-to-end encryption and all,1
"Every day whatsap is changing places of different options which is meaningless. Current interface is ugly. Moving status bar from up to down is meaningless. Only A1 is appreciable, nothing else.",1
We all know that change comes with some difficulty but for me my suggestions are two 1. Create a different space for channels don't jumble it with status. 2. Make the status refreshable just like the chats. i•e when you tap the status button it takes you to the first update directly. Thank you for your timely consideration.,1
"Undoubtedly, this app works very well but the recent updates are painful to use the app. The essential features like Status, call logs and communities have been redesigned at the bottom of the home screen and the swipe feature to view the status or call logs tabs have also been removed. This made the user experience worse within few days of the updates. These issues need to be fixed asap. When deleting messages for everyone it should be completely removed from the chat and no "".. ""message was..""",1
"It's an okay messaging app, although I would like to see more animations for chats for when you're in a chat and receive a text or when you send a text, the chat bubbles just snap into position which isn't very aesthetically pleasing. Unlike the other apps such as Messenger where they have some level of animation in their chats.",1
This app is great but with the recent update the design and looks have changed for the worse if I'm being honest I prefer the green at the top Instead of the white and the new Icons just don't look good hopefully this will be converted back to the original,1
"the only updates i asked for was for the navigation menu to be moved back to the top, add a minimize channels feature and to make the status reply button less far down the screen to make it easier to tap. and you decided to update literally everything but that??? come on whatsapp get it together 😭 can't say i enjoy these unnecessary updates, it only makes the app less familiar. (i won't lower my rating bc of the stickers feature tho, that's the ONLY good update atm)",1
"With this new update, it's hard to press ""read more"" on status. It's automatically opening the keyboard to reply. I think it was OK the way it was previously. Also, status videos continues playing even after we've closed it. And video status also glitches when watching, with sound and visuals not in sync.",1
"Your recent auto update that I didn't approve has moved the function buttons to the bottom (from the top). It's the worse thing that you have done. Functionally it was much better at the top, and I don't personally use the update function so this is a waste. Not a good move on 2 accounts. I have all auto updates off and yet this change happened before I knew it!",1
"The new update sucks, everything is just crowded and chats, status updates, community calls have been literally taken down. I also have a problem with this media automatic download, no matter how I keep changing my settings there's always that one group when something is sent WhatsApps decides to automatically download it and saves it to my internal storage and I have to delete it manually. Where's that button where you can choose who, or which, is allowed to automatically download files?",1
"Hello Team WhatsApp! So far the WhatsApp's performance is the best than ever but I encountered a minor problem recently. The problem is that the WhatsApp doesn't make me play videos in Chrome or any browsing platform while I am on video call. I tried it on different video conferencing apps like Messenger and Instagram and it is functional, concluding that WhatsApp seems to be the problem. I hope this would be fixed soon.",1
"Lastest update with 'search by date' feature buggy. As of today (16/02), upon testing the new 'search by date' feature on a highly active old group chat, using the date of 2 weeks prior (02/02) works fine, however when trying it again for 1 more day prior to that (01/02) it hangs for a while and then takes me all the way back to 2015 when the group was originally created!",1
"Dear Team, Could u pl ensure the message 'info' and 'copy' options (widely used) reflect at the top alongside other 4 options? This will save lot of time & vl be easier to operate. This is already available in WhatsApp Business. 2) In the update the exact status uploaded time of contacts Only displayed as 'yesterday!' Earlier it used to be displayed as 'yesterday at 5:40 pm', accurate time; pl bring back such useful feature. 3) Pl allow to clear all group messages by tapping on the group icon",1
"Whatsapp should add the option to create folders so we can arrange and group our text and work. Its actually stressing. Also the number of chats we can pin should be increased and not limited to only 3. On the status, the status should be a like a click able button that returns us back to the top when we click it. Its annoying having to scroll back to the top when a feature like this could solve the problem. Those are my problems and not just mine",1
"On previous update when making phone call it shows ""calling"" when the person that you are calling is offline, and ""ringing"" when the person is available, but now it only shows ""ringing"" regardless of whether the person is available or not. Its a niche feature but a very useful one. Shame that you guys took it out",1
"Literally the stupidest way of handling data back ups... ever. If there's an obvious back up saved on your cloud, why is it so hard to put a little prompt that says 'Restore from this backup'? When you work a job that requires many phone changes back to back, the more irritating it becomes that such a simple detail that'd vastly improve the lives of users could be so easily overlooked by one of Cuckerburg's big companies. Sort it out.",1
"1. The locked chats are great but the finger scanner needs sorting out because about 3 times out of 10 I put my thumb on the scanner exactly and sometimes it still won't recognise my thumb print. Annoying. 2. People have been screenshotting my status, sending it to other people and these people can easily do anything with it and before you say ""adjust your status privacy"" I did but apparently I can't trust people, a notification would be nice to let me know if people screenshot my status.",1
"My only problem is uploading photos or status. When it is 2.9mb the quality of the video goes worst like 144pixels. Even I cropped the video as much as I can but still it's worst. Can you fix it?? I just need a quality video or photos when uploaded to status. Please consider this, Also I don't have HD option.",1
"A really great app. But transferring chats from phones of different platforms (iPhone to android) is a nightmare. I've lost my chats twice now. I've followed the methods provided but it still won't transfer all the chats. Please fix this, it's already 2024.",1
"The app itself works flawlessly but I BEG you to stop with the layout changes.. Although changes are (mostly) minimal, it's enough to disturb me completely when texting! I still use the app for all my chats and won't change it in the future, but please stop changing so much on the apps appearance!",1
I have turned on the in-built WhatsApp applock(fingerprint) and at first it was working well but suddenly today it is malfunctioning. It keeps asking for fingerprint again and again. I have important data in it. Please check if there's a bug in the in-built applock or not. Thanks.,1
It was an incredible app. but new looks are not good restore it back to how it was before now a days it look very dry dry restore back how it was before and do something for picture and video quality it make our videos and pictures quality very low,1
its a good app to keep in touch with my family but every time I want to post something on my status the video plays in slowmo and when I look at others status the audio plays in the background after I finish looking at it I dislike some if the new updates like the channels they are just irritating and then the ai what's the point of it ?,1
"Everything is fine except for custom stickers. After the latest update, I cannot use my stickers I've downloaded. Everything else works except for them! I click on the sticker pack icon and it lights up like I tapped it, but the stickers do not appear for me to send. Very frustrating!",1
"I'm a big Whatsapp user and have loved it over the years. But... the changing of the status tab and the pushing of channels is beyond infuriating. I don't want channels. No one I know wants channels. I want to view statuses, but these are now relegated to the top bar on the Statuses tab, likrle an afterthought. Channels need to be moved to their own tab instead of taking over the Statuses tab",1
"Please, it's about time you integrate a status saver in the next update. Don't wanna use other unofficial versions just because of a status saver. After all these years and I still can't upload status without it been blurred? That's messed up. This app doesn't allow us to do much customization.",1
"The app is okay but something annoys me so much that'll make me leave 3 stars. The video and picture quality is too poor that when ever I post a status with a quality picture or video, it makes my post a very poor quality one with I don't like at all. Pls can you help with that.",1
"Can you please work on the quality of the image they are so poor, if i want to upload a status it will be uploaded in a bad quality If i want to edit the quality from setting--> storage i can't find the option of photo uplaod quality. Hope you solve this bug or issue as soon as possible . Thank you.",1
Only 4 stars cause it really reduces quality of photos you share on status and even private chat. Edit: What's with the unnecessary changes?? The interface is so green now it's blinding. There was absolutely no need to change the old one,1
"I have always loved this app to send multiple cute stickers created by me stored in my favourites, but not anymore.. I can only send 1 sticker at a time, taking me lots of time as it will go back to the top after each click, making it not user-friendly.. Hope there is no limitation for stickers sharing so that I can continue to send multiple stickers at one go to substitute my texts, making them creative & enjoyable for all to read them.. Thank u!",1
- I thik the user interface is not good i like the classic one. - Don't make the app complex. - Add theam how want to choose classic interface he simply use the theam who wants to use modern they'll use - The new Ai update is good i like this update but I think the set msg timing and send automatic massage to a contact on WhatsApp is helpful for example. - Send a msg on xyz on 11:03 am (i am happy) And Ai bot send msg directly!,1
"Whatsapp has been a good app but... I've not been able to login to my account after it has been unbanned. Whenever I try to open the official application on my phone, it shows I need an official Whatsapp application to login. Meanwhile, I'm using the official application that I downloaded here. Please help me fix it as soon as possible. I want to message my friend and family. Thanks for always helping out.",1
The old version was very good with slide option to change from chats to updates. It was very comfortable before but now there is a open search bar at the top center and also we can change pages but sliding very irritating.,1
Whenever I open the AI the app crashes. Also whats app groups should be separated from the personal chats. There should also be an option to view all the media that was sent in a group incase i missed it. Not just showing the stuff I already downloaded.,1
"I seriously don't like the changes every other week!! And now the top part of Whatsapp is white and it just looks wrong! Give us options as to colour and placement of icons. And the search bar looks silly being so big, an icon is sufficient. You are not Microsoft.",1
"Whatsapp is honestly very useful and you can't disagree, it's good. But with every recent update all they do it RUIN the interface and make it look super cluttered, where whatsapp used to look neat and tidy. Why did they even replace the search button with a huge and permanent search bar. It looks HORRIBLE",1
A very big problem with the add participants option is if you are calling someone on WhatsApp and accidentally the screen lights up that button pressed other person will be added to your call accidentally and they will listen to you private conversations. And you will not know it.,1
I really like this app but the recent modifications have been downgrades really. If you want to make changes please leave the option to use the classic UI. That search bar is really annoying to be honest.,1
"when you attempt to navigate to dangerous sites or download dangerous files. Fast downloads and view web pages and videos offline Chrome has a dedicated download button, so that you can easily download videos, pictures and entire web pages with just one tap. Chrome also has downloads inside Chrome, where you can access all of the content that you downloaded, even when you're offline. Google Voice Search. Chrome gives you an actual web browser that you can talk to. Use your voice to find answe",1
"I dont like when it wont add people that ""recently"" left a group. I dont really like the down dock options layout. It just gets worse every update. It was 2 days after someone left i wanna ad him and it still thinks that he left the group ""recently"". I just dont like the app overall. It just has really annoying things.",1
"I've never had an issue with the App before but with the Current update, Someone can log into my using my Pin in case I'm not around in case they know it. I'm not comfortable with that idea and I hope You'll allow the user to choose to Use Biometrics only without the Pin as an alternative.",1
"Great Chat Experience. Partially Reliable Calling. Now Meta AI? WhatsApp has been my go-to chat client for years because of family, friends and colleagues. However, since Meta's acquisition of it, they have been losing the plot. Now, we have Meta AI integration? Who asked for that? Also, I want this to be able to be deactivated since it is now making me question if the inclusion is now signalling that our messages could potentially be subject to learning.",1
"Cool app but I've encountered a security bug. Sometimes whenever I open the app, if I closed it with a chat opened, it would open the app with no authentication(fingerprint). Then if I back out of the chat then the app lock shows up. I've had this a lot recently and kinda kills the app for me.",1
"Please get rid of the ""message"" feature when you hold on the screen whilst on a video call. It is the nost annoying and useless feature in my opinion. No pros, just cons to it. Thank you so much",1
WhatsApp although a good platform of communication with its user-friendly interface. After too many updates all that is good but according to me there should be an option thorugh which anybody can customise tabs or layout. This is how we can easily modify our app according to our requirements.,1
"I LOVED WhatsApp BUT I don't like the new updates. I hate the ""Ask Meta AI"" search bar. And I also don't like that you added the channels at all. I feel like you are trying to make WhatsApp a mix of all the other social media apps instead of just keeping it the original and unique communication app that it first was. This was always a 5 star app BUT NOW I give it 3 ⭐️ Please consider going back to the original!!!!",1
App is useful but there is a microphone problem with me coz my voices don't record properly. My phone mic work friendly on business Whatsapp messenger insta or other apps but when ever i use WhatsApp i face that problem i don't know where is the problem I've already checked my phone mic its work on calls or other things but disturbing me on WhatsApp voice recording.,1
Very responsive team I ever experienced and continuously improving user interface. Must provide functionality of unsaved number phone calls or messages so that we may not need to save number of everyone unknown person.,1
"This is the best update ever in a decade. Best for one handed use. Add 2 things in which: (1) we can mute/unmute specific person notification (sms,voice,media) in the group but it should not affect that specific person personal conversation's or chat's notification and (2) we can keep archive specific person's conversation or chat for always / 1 hr / 8 hrs but it should not apply for any other conversation or chat that we haven't chosen for.",1
I love this app and it's use but recently there have been some updates that I am really not a fan of. The first letter in 'typing' and 'online' are now capital. And there is a UI update that hurts my eyes. But overall a good social media platform. Would recommend.,1
Could use some customization features and the option to add a picture to a contact that has no picture (something very basic). And also the option to hide Communities and Businesses.,1
"Bruh! Don't know why the feature of admin being to delete messages was added, so much for free speech eh? Don't have any issues but that. Please, let it go. Yall changed the design to look like that of an apple device, we didn't ask for that, the execution is bad. If it's possible, return back to the default interface",1
"I like it so far but I honestly feel that you guys should stop updating everytime and just stick to one thing. Either ways my one problem is that I wished we can repost status voice messages on our status. Like I mean when someone sends a vn to his/her status, I wish we could repost those vns to our own status is all m saying. Either way pls take this into consideration.",1
Urmm... it's good... it's the best but ...but the voice recorder is bad.. including the voice call...but above all... it's still the best .. y'all should try improve on those things.. thank you. And also ...the status display.. it's like Whatsapp... brings down the quality of a posted video or pics..why?... sometimes I find it hard to post.. again,1
"This app has been really good and functional...but for the love of God let's go back to knowing the difference in ""calling"" and ""ringing"". Right now it's really confusing, I don't know when the person on the other end is offline and can't pick up and when the call actually goes through. Everything just displays ""Ringing"". Please.",1
"I hate that my private chats and group chats are showing up on the same list, it's tiring. I'm in lot's of groups where I barely read messages but each time a message pops up the group rises to the top of my chats. It's the little things that made people switch to GB WhatsApp, convenience is not too much to ask for. One would think after so many years of development you lot would get this already!",1
"Since today's evening, the 12/04/2024, I haven't been able to use my WhatsApp, it keeps crashing each time I open it. I have updated the WhatsApp, yet the issue persists. When the issue started, it was telling me to clear my cache, that there's bug. Please fix this as soon as possible. Thank you..",1
It was working okay until for some reason after the last update it hasn't opened!!! Im sure its a bug because i have done everything on my side which is clear cache. It's also not backing up data for a while. So I'm afraid of all my data disappearing because all my university stuff is there.,1
"Don't use bottom navigation bar . Please use tab bar view as before.... 🙏🙏 And status tab is not updating immediately when i watched the status return back to status tab it takes 1 or 2 seconds to remove the viewed status from the list My Android version is 14 , also i am unable to get calls on app closed even i turned on background running",1
"A great messaging app, especially between iPhone and Android users, however with every new update, the layout and colour theme/style seems to be getting worse. It works great, but looks horrible, I have mixed feelings",1
"Messages are no longer vibrating my phone when when coming in, I've changed all settings regarding notifications and chats, and even reset notification settings, nothing changed. Message notifications coming up as silent notifications, when they are set to alerting it goes back to silent on its own. Others have already talked about the issue with the stickers.",1
Not able to see the same update in the two accounts on WhatsApp. 1. In one account navigation tabs at the bottom 2. In another account navigation bars at top This is happening even after updating the app to the latest version from Play Store.,1
"I don't know the reason behind new UI updates new navigation bar and search bar at the top, I know you have followed lot of procedures and feedbacks, I don't think new navigation bar is useful to anyone and what is that search bar, why it is so attached to the top layer, whatapp UI was so minimalistic and good, these two features are restricting the chatbox area. I know it might make the app user-friendly for new user but option to hide this features in settings would be helpful for others.",1
Whatsapp has been a great app to stay in contact with friends and family but the recent app updates haven't really been the best. Whatsapp should go back to the original whatapp look and should stop making so many changes in short spaces of time. These changes have made the app a bit buggy and very slow. Please go back to the old version.,1
"The app is good. However, I would suggest they include a central point setting that allows you to hide media from gallery, instead of having to go chat by chat, and also a feature for reposting a status without having to screenshot or asking someone to send it to you. Also , it would prefer the chats and groups to be placed in different tabs; one for chats and the other for groups.",1
"Been working fine now when I make a video its silent no sound. I have checked all the permissions, uninstalled/reinstalled lost all my photos but still no sound when making a video. used the phones record software all fine. whatsapp ???",1
WhatsApp has not made any changes in the frame size for dp I would request for same to make certain changes Many times we are not able to apply our favourite picture on dp just because the frame by default may not capture the complete image It's a request to you WhatsApp team that pls launch a feature where we can apply a complete picture without cropping anything in it. Thankyou!,1
I have a very amazing experience from almost 6 years using WhatsApp but now there is issue when I call to a person then its show unavailable option on screen and recipient Don't get my call even no notification... don't known why but this is happening from last month ... Anyone have any idea why this is happening and how i can solve this issue if someone have good suggestion them must share .,1
"Its a great app over all, but there are still some bugs and one that bothers me most is the security Whatsapp gives you the option of putting either a pin or fingerprint or both if you want But the problem is that the pin only shows up ocationally and not everytime you open the app, the fingerprint comes up everytime, but sometimes it just does'nt scan your finger and keeps you locked out of the app The only way to get in is to restart your phone and try again, wich gets very anoying",1
UI is at a downfall. Search bar at halfway top and toggle tray at the bottom like what is going on. Don't try to make Android like iOS. The previous UI was much better and updates tab is hilarious like I cannot see status of people properly and these huge channel banners come up like I don't want these things. Don't fix things which aren't broken. I mean the photos of the app running posted on Play Store are better than the actual app experience,1
"Probably the best messenger of all due to its universality across multiple platforms, but still could be better. Biggest plus is sending pictures - it keeps almost the same resolution. But it's most major flaw is no way to simply block an unknown contact/number from outside your contacts (not a message/chat but a call).",1
"Using the latest update, I feel the ""Ask Meta AI or Search"" textbox should be pinned. It was a lot easier to search out contacts even after scrolling down for long. Now I have to scroll back up until I reach the top before I can use the search tool.",1
"WhatsApp used to be distinctly green. Now it blends into an ocean of bland, insipid, pale apps with no personality. Pity. Also it asks me for feedback on call quality at least once a day, it's becoming tiresome. Very useful otherwise, but I miss the colour.",1
"Please include another lock with fingerprint lock. As in lockscreen, we can either type password or fingerprint. Yesterday when my mom wasn't well and we were in hospital. I was sweating that's why I was unable to unlock my WhatsApp with my fingerprint. Please consider the issue and include both lock so that when we are unable to unlock the phone with fingerprint we can type the password.",1
have been using this app since long a lot of progress had been made and it is quite helpful but there are somethings which should be done in the next update please take it as a request. There should be a proper way of hiding the chats since the chat lock is not supported in many device it only supports in device with fingerprint and in other devices this feature is just useless! If new features are made then it should be supported in all devices.,1
"I find the menu at the bottom of the homepage to be taking too much space. I feel there should be an option for hiding the icon names at the bottom , or an option to collapse the entire menu. The effort to bring everyone back is commendable, update the UI at least though. Otherwise, all else is not that bad.",1
"The latest update of this app has left me feeling disappointed. The new version has a cheap and unprofessional appearance, and it has lost some of the features that made it valuable. The user interface has become cluttered, making it frustrating to use. If the developers want to retain loyal users like me, they should consider reverting to the previous version or making significant improvements to the current one.""",1
"everything is great, THE search bar needed TO BE AT-THE bottom part OF-THE opening ui , so anyone can reach THE search bar instantly on their larger screen sized Smartphone AND tablets. that's THE only bad thing ABOUT whatsapp's new user interface (UI) right now.",1
"Very useful and handy, yet it still needs some improvements. It should give users more controls like customizing the interface appearance and more text styles management to name few. More control on Status privacy, instead of muting status I should be able to disable seeing status from selected contacts as it is in hiding contacts when posting a status.",1
"Only time will tell.Good to know that the people behind the app are constantly upgrading with new features! That's the way to go ,when competition is on your heels! Mubarak ! Let Telegram try to catch up. It is very hard to delete jaded conversations on telegram but not on WhatsApp ,where one has a choice of one day 7 days or 30 days. Though I'd personally like a14 day option too or 10 days one!👍🙏🤝m",1
"The layout is changing very frequently. The search bar on top of message list was a bit annoying. The layout of the search bar war visually terrible, very discomforting design.",1
"Everything's really well bout this app, but recently it's glitching so freaking bad. That whenever I'm going to send any sticker to someone, it's lagging and not letting me scroll down to search any other stickers. Same as the emoji page is getting vanished completely just leaving one column from the starting. Seriously what the heck is wrong with this app idk. Please slove this issue asap. This's getting really annoying 😮‍💨",1
"For months now, my whatsapp has been acting weird. Sometimes it shows contacts names but most of the times it shows only numbers. Sometimes I see people's post and most of the times, I don't. I even tried to search for contacts to write but it won't show until I wait for minutes before it shows. I've deleted the whatsapp and re-download but all to no avail. Is there anything I can do to rectify this issue?",1
"5 stars for the past 8 years but this year is filled with poor updates. Don't fix what's not broken!! Revert the font, drop the neon green and remove communities. Allow us to swipe left or right to access statuses or contacts. It's so frustrating that the current developers are adding useless features and updates in attempt to stay relevant.",1
"Never had an issue with the app UNTIL New Years' Day. Something hasn't been the same since. I have to restart my phone after about 10 minutes, as I type out a message, press send, and it disappears instead of sending. Nothing different in settings, and its become tiresome now. Any fixes for this issue guys?",1
"Pls return the swipe switch feature to the home interface. I don't need to switch to move from chats to status. It was easy to navigate in the older version but with this update, one has to click to switch from one page to another when you could simply swipe. Also, return the archive pane Thank you",1
"This app have been working fine and it was quite interesting and I enjoyed it. However, I started having experience with loging into my account but it has been impossible to reach out to the support team. Some nasty stickers were added to the my account automatically and I could not remove it. I could not regain access to my account and it's annoying.",1
Fingerprint unlock has been removed in the new update. If someone knows the password of your phone then he can open your WhatsApp. This update I don't like it . Please enable app unlock feature again as before . And even it's not showing biometric unlock option it's showing dierct screen lock password to open the WhatsApp. This is bad 😞,1
"New update-status deleting option is irritating. While old way is enough. Now have to check each status. Atleast alow to select and delete status. Placement of status and chats are discomforting, older version was user friendly. I think some Ideas are able to change... New chages - search bar in home page is some irritating. Atleast give an option to change at user end...",1
"When we add multi accounts to WhatsApp we must be logged in on both devices to better manage messages, device battery, current device convenience, etc. Too many scammers on this app! Great app. Feedback— Messages from business, bots & websites require different page, backup occupies huge data quantity including media & multiple accounts same data. Scheduling messages needed. Even it'll be better for the web version to work on mobile device browsers.",1
New update/facelife everything is fine new bottom navigation bar is great but what is this new permanently showing search bar with no padding between search bar and upper action/app bar it's inconsistent and wastes space and ruin's experience. Just one search icon in action bar would be sufficient. Like they showing in marketing material about new update.,1
"The app is very good in a basic features. Why are you update frequently, this is literally bad. The look of the WhatsApp is very worst , the features like updates status call logs all are in a down side which is very bad, the app is looking weird😡😤. If you are doing this continuously, we will use the telegram in future. Why are redesigning again and again ? Please leave the app freely. Change the app's feature to old version. Over technology is lead to the failure. And very worst you are!!",1
I am facing an issue with the backup since January 9th .. it has refused to back up since then 1. My backup drive has sufficient storage 2. The all is updated to the latest version 3. I can't change the backup storage location even if I tried because I receive a response stating that back up is in progress .. I have been trying daily for more than a month now. 4. Phone is fully charged. 5. Phone is fully updated to the latest android version 6. I shutdown and restarted the device beforehand,1
"I haven't even updated app, yet I suddenly have an updated home screen. Navigation bar for chats, calls etc is now at bottom of screen, which makes it feel like more work to find them when viewing the screen, as you automatically view from top, and they are just in the way of fingers & too easy to press by accident. I'm sure some people might find this useful, however, the option to customise the home screen & revert to having this at top would be beneficial for those of us who really don't",1
"It's functioning flawlessly and meeting expectations. However, I'd like to address the chat lock feature. Its primary aim is to provide the ability to secure chats when your phone is accessible to others. The concern arises when a chat is considered locked even though it can be opened using a pattern. I believe a true chat lock feature should only be unlockable with a fingerprint. So if I lock a chat with my fingerprint, someone with access to my phone would be unable to view the locked chats.",1

"I find WhatsApp to be very helpful in daily communication due to its ease and efficiency. I appreciate that WhatsApp is free from intrusive ads. However, I feel that the recent UI updates in WhatsApp are not satisfactory. The previously simple and easy-to-navigate interface now feels cluttered, especially with the addition of channel and community features, which seem to disrupt the clean and simple WhatsApp experience. The new icons also appear less cohesive with the previous design.",1

Cool updates. There's an ai system now but I feel like it's just chat gpt but worse. The calls and videos calls are fine. But the annoying thing is that if you don't have Internet connection and you're outside when you get connect to the Internet or WiFi all the messages come in later than it actually was sent. So example a group chat was texting a lot in the afternoon and at night you have your WiFi connection or something like that all the messages will come in at night.,1

Good interface and nice functionality. Does what I need it to do. Wish they would release features a bit more quickly. Example: we've seen online about a UI refresh to make navigation more finger friendly. I've been waiting a month or more for this. I get the update and the description references said UI refresh. Opening the app however shows no changes. I know you're developing an app for millions but just a bit faster updates pls? 🙏or don't advertise them & users then wait for feature drops.,2
"WhatsApp with it's new update is quite the mobile messenger. I do however want to make a suggestion. You recently introduced the feature that enables users to edit their messages. May I suggest that, just as you did when you introduced the feature that helps users reply specifically to a message by swiping right, you can also introduce the function to edit a mesaage by swiping left on it. At the moment, swiping left does nothing. It would make it most convenient to use. Thank you.",2
"This has been a great app, best messaging app by a distance. The recent changes are great. But it can be improved upon. With people belonging to several chat groups these days, groups chats need to be separated from individuals', and their should be option to change the default display menu colours and outlook. In short more customization option should be integrated.",2
"Pretty good messaging app, but lacks some features enjoyed in alternatives such as scheduling messages and changing chat colors. The polls are useful and the new AI features are good albeit somewhat limited, but overall the app is reliable and popular, so it does the job. EDIT after upgrading to pixel 8 pro: pretty much the same experience, but for some reason locked chats require 2 scans to access rather than the one used to open the chat drawer on my old phone.",2
"This is a great communication app with one highly annoying feature. The search function SUCKS. Yeah, big time. If you search for a contact, let's say John, you might have several contacts named John, or John himself may have more than one WhatsApp account. The problem is if you go one step backward immediately after entering a search, you don't see a search history! So to search for the same term again (whether it's a name or any other term) then YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE TERM AGAIN... AND AGAIN...",2
"the texting back and forth here is really done well I text and I can see when the other person has read it. I am also able to send photos ans short videos and recieve. I am also able to send files and recieve as well. you can voice message. the one thing I'm not crazy aboit is when I delete something, it leaves a ghost print leaving a print that something was there, which leads to the question; what did you delete? that is all I know about this qpp thus far.",2
"The last update changed the reply on status from swipe up to a bar in the bottom, which is very annoying. First, it sometimes blocks the photo/ video, secondly if there is a long message on the status & I press ""Read more"" to reveal the whole message the reply window pops up. The old version was perfect, no need to change it. Btw there should be an option to shut off these annoying channels",2
"I like the new update, the UI looks fresh and sleek, and the AI is fun. I also appreciate the option of being able to make stickers from photos directly in the app, but it seems there's only 2 options for the backgrounds. Those are auto crop or full background. I don't see any eraser tool, besides the one in the paint brush tool which doesn't seem to work for backgrounds or paint. If this were fixed and I could erase parts of the background from within the app it would be 5 stars",2
"*Review:* ""I've been using WhatsApp form [2018] and overall, it's been a great experience. The app is user-friendly, and I appreciate the end-to-end encryption for secure conversations. The group chat feature is also very useful for staying connected with friends and family. However, I'd like to see some improvements: - [my suggestion"" about in chat setting to add text color options for text"" and add signature options for text""] Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing new featur",2
"Hi WhatsApp Team, I love the new update, but I'm finding it a bit inconvenient to access the search bar. Having to scroll up to the top of the chat list every time I want to search for a contact is taking a bit of time. Would it be possible to add a shortcut or a more prominent placement for the search bar? Maybe a dedicated search button or a quick access option? This would make it so much easier to find and start conversations quickly! Thank you for your hard work and consideration.",2
"It's a great app, very useful and easy to use but some features I think would make it even better are: -Polls on statuses, allow users to post polls on their status , and viewers vote -The voice messaging update is great, but what would make it better was if we can also add on a message to the recording. -Allow us to tag people on the status. If all other suggestions are ignored please take this one into consideration, IT WOULD BE AWESOME. But overall great app 👍🏾",2
"Overall the app is amazing, however I feel that there is a need for few (major) things. 1. The search bar shouldn't be on the top. Earlier, it looked better when it was in the corner. 2.The archive bar (if that's what it's called) is always there at the top, and that too doesn't look like just like the search bar. Kindly move it below the chats. 3.MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL is the need of 'schedule messages'. They are really helpful. Also, kindly bring the PREVIEW again.",2
"Hi Team, The new UI is good, I have some suggestions 1. It could be better to change the new search box to the top bar, so that can render one more chat in one shot. 2. Bottom navigation bar taking too much space, better to reduce the padding. For each update, the number of chat displayed in first screen is reducing. If possible try to adjust the padding and space. Thank you!",2
"I appreciate the latest WhatsApp update, the new search bar location is a big inconvenience. Before, searching contacts from anywhere in the list was a breeze. Now, scrolling all the way up or reaching the notification bar disrupts the flow. A dynamic search bar appearing as you scroll down (like in Android settings) or reverting to the old search function would be a huge improvement!.",2
"No doubt whatsapp has made life easier. However, the expectations have gone higher with so many new options on play store. Somehow doing whatspp video calls on my phone have become a pain. The video quality is not good, after few minutes my video frame freezes, further few minutes the app crashes and sends an error message 'whatsapp isn't responding'. Would be helpful if you can resolve it.",2
"This app is very good only issue is that they have now changed the settings I know you have no button to turn off the picture that you can put in the background of a video call, meaning I now have a picture in the background of my video calls that I cannot turn off. Only way I can stop people from seeing it is if I switch cameras two main camera the one that faces everyone else",2
"The voice notes I record are constantly paused both hands free (with the caption ""recording"", although it has stopped recording) and the regular option. So the recording has cutted parts. I've already granted full microphone access through my phone's configuration, and also uninstall the app, but nothing has fixed this big problem!!!",2
"This application, since I use it it's simply fantastic. Everything works for perfect, and I find easy usage of it. However, I have a suggestion. I ask to the developers, if possible to add some functionalities that were included in GBWhatsApp, like allow only people to know that I have read their message once I respond to it. Thanks to read my comments !",2
"WhatsApp continues to impress with its innovations and recent updates, providing users with a seamless messaging experience. However, there is one improvement that could enhance user convenience even further. The integration of a separate tab for groups, distinct from personal chats, would streamline the user interface and prevent the muddling of group and personal conversations. This adjustment would make it easier for users to navigate between their various conversations.",2
"New interface It looks good, and the navigation is easy to access with our fingers. The search box is optional; why did you include it in the top chat area, which is always open? Whenever we want to search, it means only using the search icon. Kindly consider this and remove the search box from the open always unnecessarily. Thanks in advance.",2
"As much as I like the app, since I was forced to update few days ago, it's been the worst app ever as i no longer get notifications for messages. Even when calls come in i only hear it ring so i have to open the app to see who is calling and also be able to pick the call. This is crazy at this point. Please fix this quickly it's no longer funny at all. Thanks I guess your latest update fixed the issue I was experiencing. I could see my calls and messages now with ease. Nice improvement 👏",2
"Ok, hear me out. There's a bug lately that whenever I open the app and try to read the chats and stuff.... it just kicks me out of the app. I tried cleaning the cache, hell, even uninstalled the app and then downloaded it bsck again... but it's no use. This wasn't like this, please fix the bug, it would be appreciated, snd I also can't receive messages or calls at all just like the other complaints of the app...",2
"WhatsApp is doing well at the moment, especially with regards the quality of voice calls and videos calls. However, the team should work on the aspect of the app that displays ""ringing"" even when recipients are offline. The ""calling"" which was previously displayed whenever recipients were offline is a better option. This would eliminate the current confusion the situation is creating among users that are yet to understand that part of the recent changes effected on the app. Thank you very much.",2
"Edit: Thank you for adding an editing feature to messages. Now please work on adding that to status. - - - - Great App, but you guys should really consider including an editing feature. One that allows you edit your messages after you've sent them and edit a status after it's up. When a status or message has been sent and there's a mistake, it doesn't make sense to delete the whole thing, when you can just edit it.",2
"Always been useful for communicating in groups or one on one. Its good that it functions in a way that is completely different to social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat because I can just choose to message my friends and family while there is no pressure attached such as streaks or public posts. I'm not a fan of how they're changing it however such as the options bar switching from the top to the bottom, it was fine where it was.",2
"I have been using WhatsApp for long, and I'm always ready for and welcome application updates, but in the last update there's a feature that I dislike completely, moving the chat, status and calls buttons to buttom of the screen is absolutely inconvenient to me, so I want to guggest that, if you really want to keep this feature, may be you should give users an option to use it or revert to the normal style. Thanks.",2
"What'sApp is very efficient and effective way of communicating with other people/users. Because of having multiple important conversations with other users , may I suggest that you give the option of having to pin more than 3 conversation. Because I have so many contacts, it's frustrating for me to look for the previous conversation with other users on WhatsApp. I hope you take it into consideration. Thank you.",2
"Great app! Been using it for a long time. But the new UI, the very high contrast, and odd looking call/video call icon is not very nice.. and the send voice message/send text feels too high contrast for me, it would be nice if there was an option to switch to the older theme as i liked that more.",2
"I love the new updates and everything but I noticed that the app has become buggy for me. I suddenly have network issues even though my network is working fine. Messages and status uploads now take like forever to send! I thought it was a general issue but my other WhatsApp in my other phone is working fine with same network. Please fix this bug, it's getting annoying!",2
"New layout good points: 1. Improved darker dark mode, yes 2. Search bar incorporated with AI search, yes Real bad point: ! Persistent bottom bar for updates, calls, community. Nobody really use it in my region, so please give us option remove it from home page or make it disappear when scrolling. It really takes up tons of space and hinder one handed use for the coveted bottom area.",2
"The app has great use and has become and inevitable part in our daily lives. It's such an useful app that has multifaceted benefits. However the recent update where the calls, status (now updates) , calls etc. have been moved to the bottom is a real inconvenience. I don't see the necessity for such a change. It's causing too much of confusion and the current layout is uncomfortable. If there's no particular use to it , then I would prefer it to go back to where it was.",2
"Whatsapp is very convenient. However, the latest update was pretty annoying, which the status bar is at the bottom. I know i have get use to the previous one, but it way more presentable and just nice. I feel annoyed with the status bar at bottom. Hope you can consider to change back to the previous. I dont mind if theres any update, but the way the layout being modified should be consider carefully. Thank you.",2
"My experience has been great overall, the interface is nice and intuitive. But I have one issue; I have so many groups and contacts that it's easy for me to miss important chats among the clutter of messages, can you guys bring a feature that will allow people organize their chats into customizable folders? I very sure a lot of people will love that feature!",2
"WhatsApp has been good so far. But there is one feature we would like to request, which is the ability to select multiple items (messages, photos, stickers, etc) by long-tapping on one to select, and then sliding up or down on the others to select them. It has been a real hassle to tap on every individual item when we have to select 100 items. We hope this feature becomes available soon. Thank you.",2
"It is an excellent app as it is very easy to use and also speeds up messages in real time. It also offers many messaging options, also allows you to share places or moments in real time so it facilitates the use, is an app that does not consume much mobile data therefore facilitates its use. Furthermore, it is always being updated to improve small bugs and give the user an excellent service. In addition, the security options it maintains are very secure, which demonstrates the app's commitment",2
"This app is good but it would be so much more convenient if there was a voice to text function like wechat. So we just speak and it will convert to text. As its used frequently by many users, this feature will definitely save our hassle and the time to type. Also, when forwarding more than one message, it would also enhance user experience and save the hassle if it can be forwarded in order. And thanks for the decent job so far!",2
"Ok. This is probably the best messenger app and has many features other apps don't have. However, here are some bugs preventing it from being 5⭐️ 1. Sometimes when opening the app it says backing up data, it reaches 100 percent but just hangs there, u can't click anything else 2. Sometimes u can't scroll down to see your stickers it will constantly move you back up 3. Sending multiple files at once will cause them to be jumbled out of order",2
"Its a great app in all honesty, when I delete the app it gives me an option to store my messages and when I re-download it, all my messages including new ones are restored, I don't have to start whatsapp afresh all the time. It's the endless updates that are quite disturbing. I wish they could've created a separate app for channels and communities.",2
"Overall the app is good, i like the new feature that now we can't take the screenshot of dp which is excellent with respect to privacy but it has one flaw. If we tap on the dp then we cannot take the screenshot but if we tap on the profile of the user, then the dp along with phone number and ""about me"" is visible on the screen, at that time we can take the screenshot of the dp. Hence, there is no benefit of the new feature. I want you to fix it asap, just like we lock our profile in facebook.",2
"I think this is one of the best messaging apps there is. There are so many features that other messaging apps just don't have. I have seen this in other reviews and do agree, with the fact that there isn't an option to come off speaker in video calls. There is also the fact that you can no longer swipe between messages and calls and updates, which is a bummer 😔. It also does drain the battery, but I am generally very pleased with this app and would certainly recommend it.",2
"I think you're asking me to describe the user interface of WhatsApp, specifically the older user-friendly version and the newer version which may not be as user-friendly. In the older version of WhatsApp, the user interface typically featured a clean and simple design with a navigation bar at the top of the screen. The navigation bar included icons for Chats, Status, Calls, and Contacts. The chat interface had a list of conversations with profile pictures, names, and last message previews.",2
"Ayo .. what's up WhatsApp. Thanks for the recent update; unfortunately it seems y'all have a bug in the house. Sometimes my calls glitch and I can hear the other person but they can't hear me. This didn't happen before the update, and yes, I tried different audio input devices. Could you please do the thing? Thanks for the patch.",2
"I have good experience with WhatsApp in general but I just have one take. It is how the ""Updates"" section render both Status & Channel. I guess there should be an option to choose from on either to display vertically or horizontally. I'm a fan of Whatsapp channel, and I still wish to see status vertically and not horizontally. But once one starts following a channel, immediately one loose the comfortability of status being rendered vertically.",2
I really like the new update but some people with different phones may find it annoying. The new video calling screen sharing thing is very smart and very useful. the only reason I do 4 star is sometimes when I'm listening to voice notes my phone blacks out for a second. at first I just thought it was my phone because my phone was lagy but then I switched phones and it still did this. I really hope the bug gets patched.,2
"Review: While WhatsApp for Android excels in many areas, one aspect that could use improvement is the stability of group calls. I've encountered instances where the call quality deteriorates, leading to dropped calls or poor audio/video performance, especially in larger groups. This can be frustrating, particularly when trying to have important discussions or catch up with friends and family. Although WhatsApp regularly updates its app, address",2
"I love the app, really though. But I think if archived chats can be moved back to the bottom of all the chats and if someone has scrolled down to the bottom of the status list, there can be an arrow or something to take the person back up. Then it would be a better update than ""channels"" or giving WhatsApp an iPhone like feature. I'll be looking forward to more updates.",2
"Really liked the app . Only complaint is that the video call quality is not that good and there is a delay in normal calls as well. Also MAINLY, there must be an option to change the name of the document while sending it . Sometimes we want names of document on our device differently than while sending it to others ! Please , thank you !",2
"I wanted to share some feedback regarding the latest update. While I appreciate the efforts, I've noticed some difficulties with the new layout for watching people's status. It feels a bit cluttered and less intuitive compared to the previous version. I'd suggest considering some adjustments to improve the user experience in this aspect. Thanks for listening!""",2
"App is without doubt one of d best amongst many... But it don't work as it should on my Samsung fold device, keeps crashing or the finger print lock has a glitch that wunt make the app open after scanning ur print to unlock, I have had to uninstall and reinstall back severally, also status updates too has a glitch... Please do something about this small but inconvenient glitches. U get d extra star when demand is fully met.",2
"I used to greatly enjoy using this app and consistently selected it as my default messaging platform. However, with the recent update, it has become rather chaotic and disorganized. Specially the change of user interface is really hard for the eyes ..Please change it to the green colored neutral interface like before..If improvements are necessary better introduce something like whatsapp games with friends and a shorts feed",2
"I love that we can now send 1min video on status. There's a new bug I've noticed. Audio messages volume is now so low. I can't fasttrack or jump some seconds. I can't pause the audio message once it's playing, I'll have to close the app from phone's window. I can't even close the message itself and view other messages. Please fix this.",2
"I was a bit dubious about the new version after reading the reviews but had no choice as I have a new tablet. I totally agree that the split screen isn't ideal. However, it can be changed back to the standard version. You just need to go into the contact settings. Basing the 4☆ review on the previous version, if there's any improvement, I'll update.",2
"Great, love the new features, although when looking through the gallery it gets to a point (not too far in either) and it seems to get overloaded because it completely stops loading. One recommendation too, every time a file i.e images, pdf etc is viewed, a pop up asking to delete or save the file to the device's gallery after would be an amazing addition.",2
"I really like the app as it's a very easy and helpful one. But, the main problem I'm facing with the app is that sometimes I found some messages sent to me which are of importance but can't be opened or viewed with the reason that the app is not updated one. That really got me frustrated many times followed by lot of inconveniences. I will appreciate a lot if this problem would be resolved. Thanks",2
"I think there's lots and lots of experience are shared so, I don't write a big note. Simply It is the greatest way of communicating with your family, friends and all. It is a wonderful app till it updates lots of things now there is lots of changes it's totally a new version of what's app but I still like it♥️. And that one point ""⭐"" that I minus it's for the betterment.💖 (Sorry but I suddenly realised that I wrote a note)",2
"Yes, it does deserve a 5 star, but recently, I hate the backup encryption feature. Like where is the code for it. Because of that I lost all my data and had to start from scratch. So one star less. I love the features rolled out recently!! Thank you! And also the newly rolled out thing, chats, status and calls all have come below instead of above, which I don't like it much, bc it seems boring if it's like that, i would like the old feature of all those things up the screen. Thank you.",2
"I deleted my previous review. Reviewing it again only because of it's update in security lock. Before the update, it was only restricted to finger print lock which was secured,now password has been added along with fingerprint which can lead to compromise ones security. Example is if someone knows the password He can unlock the phone likewise WhatsApp chat.",2
"The latest version of whatsapp has many issues. I personally feel that the main issue is voice call,when the display time of my phone is turned off and i use my phone into multi window suddenly my voice turned off for the another person to the call and we says hello hello to each other. I kindly request to solve this issue as soon as possible in the next version 🙏",2
"It's a great app (although the new dark mode UI just doesn't work for me ) I just wish there were more privacy options like: 1. Show blue-tick when I reply (not when message opened) 2. Who can call me options (e.g. ""my contacts except..."" Or ""Only..."") Would also love to have an option to remove the ""muted updates"" section on the updates tab... So that if I mute everyone's updates nothing will appear for me",2
"Dear developers , please do put an option to clear/delete chat in channels section. As many channels have lot of media content, which need regular cleanup. After some effort, Found a method to delete the media from settings->storage->[channel name] .. 😓 Even then the App is crashing without deleting media.. . Also it's better to let the user pick the 'duration' (days to years) for 'disappearing message' settings... It's good idea to put disappearing message timer for Channels 😲",2
"I love the recent features introduced like channels, switching from audio recording to video recording, editing text sent etc. and would like to see more but recently some contacts' statuses don't show, that it they don't download when I tap on them to watch. It's not that there's an internet connection, syncing issue, privacy settings or the like s too.",2
"Hello I just want to inform that a recent update of the app (an update before the latest one) has caused issues with the stickers, the issue is when I scroll down to get to a set of stickers the stickers automatically get back to the start which makes it difficult to get to a certain set of stickers & choose one, surprised this hasn't been noticed & corrected so I thought to inform.i hope this will help to solve the issue. Thanks",2
"I would like to suggest a feature enhancement for the app. Currently, when receiving messages, they are all displayed in one combined thread, whether they are from individual chats or group conversations. I believe it would greatly improve user experience if there was an option to separate messages from group chats and individual chats. This would make it easier to distinguish between personal messages and group conversations, allowing for more organized communication. I hope you u work on it",2
"The platform's overall performance and functionalities are in very good shape. There is however, one factor I'd like to point out, to add a feature to tag someone when updating status which might be of utmost relevance/importance to the person so they won't miss out on those updates from the colleagues/contacts that tagged them. Hope to see this in your next 2 to 3 updates. Thanks!",2
"Obviously really love this app, however, since the Android OneUI update a month ago, WhatsApp has been glitching when it comes to theme colours. My phone is set to dark mode, but I prefer WhatsApp in light mode. This glitches out often, every time I use the app, where random text bubbles in chat, the typing bar, and settings pages will just randomly switch to dark mode. This is particularly annoying, as the text and background will often end up being the same colour, making it difficult to read.",2
"Sometimes, when I try to send a 4K video from the share option in the gallery, a popup shows, ""You don't have enough disk space."" I don't know why it appears because I have more than 70GBs of free space in my phone's internal storage, and I think it won't be ""not enough"" for a video less than 100MB in size. Others work OK.",2
"My account was suspended for some time, it's back now but I can't login. Anytime I try, I keeps showing me 'unable to connect'. I've tried different networks, even used WiFi, but still the same outcome. Please I need help and I haven't backed up for a while now and I have important messages and documents. Arigato",2
"4 stars cos you guys after doing some change to the app you removed the feature of making statuses clearer, what I mean is, posting statuses on high quality. Now what's happening is whenever I, in fact not I but whenever we post a high quality video or photo on the status, it turns out to shrink the quality of the content and becomes very low quality. Bring that feature back please. Thanks",2
"I've enabled face unlocking on my device, but it's not recognizing my face or unlocking my WhatsApp app. I've tried restarting my phone, updating my operating system, and re-registering my face, but nothing seems to be working. I'm getting frustrated and would love some assistance to resolve this issue. Please help me figure out what's going wrong and how to",2
Everything is pretty perfect with the app. The only reason I gave it 1 less star is because of the COMMUNITY FEATURE. PLEASE EITHER REMOVE IT OR ALLOW US OPT OUT OF IT COMPLETELY. I have been getting added to different groups that are spam and it does not all us to simply block out the whole feature like a regular block. Please change this! Thank you!,2
"WhatsApp has been good in the last few days but I think there are some few tweaks that's still needs work. The emojis must be able to support the default system emoji, I don't really fancy WhatsApp themed emojis. Also, please allow users to schedule messages to send. And the most of all, Allo us to share status with an improved quality. Overall it's a really fun app I recommend.",2
"I love the new update, it makes the entire UI look nicer and more appealing. My only drawback is the fact that we can't slide from one section to the other as we always could. That was a feature I heavily relied on while using WhatsApp and now it's not there any longer. Also, the color could have a change too, the dark mode seem like it's more of green than actual dark. Besides all these, the new update is really appealing and I'd like I could do the things I could do on the old on this too.",2
"All things considered, WhatsApp is useful to us in our day-to-day activities and has become ingrained in our culture of keeping and sharing secrets. However, I have always noticed that when I post a status update or a video on WhatsApp, the contact person does not see the exact clear image and instead sees a blurry version of the image. You can improve the status bar so that it displays the same real-size image on status.",2
"I like that the ""Share screen"" feature is added on this app on video call. This helps in explaining/ teach someone on a call or have fun showing ideas from my screen. I however would like this to improve with adding features like ""annotation"" which would help to be highlight markers or pointers while sharing my screen. This would help teaching elder people what to touch on the phone if I was for example giving a tutorial.",2
"The app is great! You can chat anyone no matter where they are. There are even invite links for groups and call links too! You can send photos and videos and I just love it. But there's a slight problem,for some contacts or groups it doesn't let me make a voice call and it says that I can't voice call them. Now this is something that's bugging me. Please fix this WhatsApp.",2
"Maybe the most used chat app in my communities (friends/work/family), but unlike telegram, whatsapp has NO AUTO SAVE TO CLOUD STORAGE, thus it creates problems that many old messages has lost, basically very very inconvenient for long term use. The 2nd problem is that auto backup process took long because it can only be done daily and can't be lower. Because of this, personally I would like to move on telegram if their user on my community become more popular",2
"Need to improve.. To separate the ""show on screen"" option for individual chats and group chats on WhatsApp would be a helpful feature. It could allow users to customize their notification settings more precisely, ensuring they don't miss important messages while reducing unnecessary distractions.",2
"I kinda liked the new interface, but one thing which started to annoy me is ... The channels... I liked it when it was new, but now I'm done with that . It's just a one-way communication,i feel very limited, and the suggestions are terrible, literally irrelevant.",2
"I think WhatsApp is definitely a go-to app for texting and calling. I can see why people keep saying that WhatsApp keep changing things and it's not necessary but I think that it's just because it's new. Putting the widgets at the bottom provides better accessibility. Although what I do find annoying is the video messages. They were great when they came out but I don't know if WhatsApp removed them, or put them somewhere else... it doesn't feel like WhatsApp as much.",2
"I love the new UI, not too laggy and speed optimized experience following the recent updates, however, I would edit to a 5⭐ if a group tab could be created to separate personal chats from group discussions, as it is a little bit stressful scrolling through to find some chats, this will make it a lot more easier to navigate the chat interface so as not to miss important discussions (both personal and group).",2
"In video call, the images look blur, the same way when a video is exported to whatsapp nowadays too, it looks blur and even when a video is sent to a friend on WhatsApp too, the same meanwhile the videos are clear on my camera. I like the fact that you can ask meta any questions and it's willing to answer",2
"Personally im inlove with change and growth and im really look forward to whatsapp making more changes to the app. I highly disagree that the developers should roll back any updates to the app, Because some of us we getting tired of staring at the same old screen.. instead of rolling back the updates entirely for everyone i suggest adding settinng that'll give individual users more control over the look of their apps. Please, Im tired of starring at the same screen for 10 years,I Love The Change",2
Very easy-to-use UI. I am not a fan of the latest updates to the Status updates interface that is displayed horizontally. I prefer the original vertical display for the status updates. I wish WhatsApp could revert to that view.,2
"When viewing a status posted from someone's channel and clicking 'view' to watch the full video, the audio from both the status and channel audio overlaps. Can you please fix this issue? Thanks!",2
"Let us choose if we want people's *status* to load automatically or not. Also, please return the search icon to the top of the screen. It's not really nice having to scroll all the way up to search for something. And to be honest, WhatsApp doesn't necessarily need the search bar to be an AI search... please lets stick to it being a messenger app. Thanks.",2
"Calling is misleading now. In previous updates, it showed ""Calling"" when you call someone but they haven't recieved the call, maybe they don't have internet or it just hasn't reached them yet that someone's calling... Then ""Ringing"" when they receive the call and it reaches. We could tell that the call has reached them or not this way. But now it just shows ""Ringing"" throughout, whether or not the calls reached.",2
"I do like this app alot , it's undoubtedly been everyone's primary text messaging app for years , its simple , basic and easy to use Very inclusive interface but still I had wish for WhatsApp to add more features to compete and stand out from other contemporary text messaging apps like telegram i would love to provide and contribute to any additional input to WhatsApp's Growth and development if necessary and needed",2
"Great effort to improve and satisfy the consumers. I have got one or two to point out. 1. Kindly give the personal chat and group chat a different section. 2. For the update section, kindly make the status and channel viewing vertical. 3. Lastly, please improve the image quality even more.",2
"The app was great. I loved its Meta AI feature, but then it showed me that I got a call from a friend. When I called her back, she refused that she didn't. It is day 3 since the launch of Meta AI, and it is very creepy. I hope whatsapp notices it and does something. The surprising fact is that it never happened before, but after the launch of AI, it occurred. It might be a glitch in the syestem, but it never happened before.",2
"The new UI update is pretty nice in my opinion. LOVE whatsapp been using it for a long time now but i have one issue. Whenever i video call someone doesn't matter how good my network is, at first they cannot see my video or i cannot see thiers. It happens to many people actually and not just me, so please drop a fix for it!",2
"I'm not sure, if this only happens to me but.. everytime I press on the ""emoji"" button, it takes up almost all of my screen. Half of it stays just blank for nothing. I hope this gets fixed as my chat gets almost completely covered by half of the emojis screen and half of blank window.",2
"on this WhatsApp update, it's mentioned that "" • Screen sharing during video calls now supports sharing audio too"" however, why does the feature cannot work on my devices? I use computer with windows 11, and smartphone with Android 12. On the other hand, please at recorder feature on WhatsApp, so we can record automatically for WhatsApp call, voice chat or confrence.",2
"We need the ability to select specific text in a message , instead of the whole message. Also, the ability to make status groups under status privacy, like tech group, family, school, would make it easier to post status addressing specific groups of people.",2
"One to say to what's app everything is all right with what's app with its every new type of updates but why it is not solving the status issue as it is not working properly & having lots of glitches while uploading a status or playing a status,as it is stopping to play & hanging down every time you try to play a status or go next also happening with own status too as it is hanging all time now",2
Perfect..app for messaging and communication but now they are updating it too much unnecessary ..that's really irritating . Now they are updating it very frequently and adding new features..which are hardly used community goups call and chats good for social things ..they added a channel feature and also displaced status .. section,2
I would add a possibility to convert an audio to written text for those who cannot hear. Also I would add a sticker making out of a video. That will be really fun. Also the possibility to Translate from an automatic fashion using AI,2
"Hi Meta WhatsApp, I don't receive the last some update, I am updating it but it's not coming to my WhatsApp... The Meta ai feature too. I think lots of people didn't receive the feature of meta. I was keep updating and deleting WhatsApp for several times and not showing the update. Today jst updated only the search bar got changed before the update didn't change..so kindly check the problem of the user and make users friendly, I loved the features and updates of WhatsApp. I want to experience..",2
"I like the recent layout where the screen is much darker unlike before. also the ""all"" ,""unread"" and ""groups"" tabs at the top makes the app layout look a little but nicer. I'd just love it if they would introduce themes for chats just like for Instagram",2
"""Hi WhatsApp Team, I'm concerned about the recent Biometric Lock update. Previously, I could use it without a PIN, but now it's required. I understand security is important, but users should have flexibility in their privacy settings. Please consider adding an option to use Biometric Lock without PIN protection or provide an alternative solution. Thank you,",2
THINGS TO IMPROVE: - Be able to set a status colour so you don't have to keep flipping. - NEW status colours. (Pastels) - Cut 30sec+ videos up into segments instead of just uploading the 30sec clip and me having to do it. -Be able to @ people on your status.,2

I like drawing what im talking about sometimes, and its a process switching between two apps for a single doodle. Im also trying to use my stylus more. Other then that, great app! Would love a way to share a way to doodle in conversation like tic tac toe. Another feature needed is a way to hide photos from the conversati",2
"This app is great, I use it a lot for calls and texting friends and family but I really don't like that it has changed from green to white inside the app. I think the green colour was easier on your eyes and matched the app to the colours associated with it and it's icon. If you could change this back that would be great. Other than that, it's a great app!",2
"For me, am just impressed with the recent updates. It would be better not to turn to the previous layout as some users are suggesting, the menu bar should remain where it has been put because it has improved on the beauty of the layout. The interface is just wow but it would even be better if the search bar, the camera icon and the drop down menu are placed just besides the search bar not putting them up and the search bar down",2
"It's a very good app. But there is a feature I'd ask for. If they could add theme colors, for example: Instead of green being the main color for everything the buttons could be color blue, yellow, purple, red, etc. I'd also like there to be a form the messages can be the color of the background just by the click of one button. This a very good app. I also wish we could forward more than messages, videos, documents, or others to more than 5 people. BTW I don't think they should change the taskbar",2
"You are rolling out the reactions to messages feature, which is good. Could you please introduce the Double Tap feature too, like in Instagram? It is much needed. Also, it would be great if you keep the ""Disappearing Messages"" customisable for both the parties. One should be able to keep the feature off for themselves while the other one keeps it on for him/her and vice versa. Also the duration for the same should be customisable as per preference",2
"The recent update brings a breath of fresh air to its interface, with a stunning redesign that enhances user experience in more ways than one. The new UI design not only adds aesthetic appeal but also offers improved functionality, making navigating through the app a breeze. One of the most noticeable changes is the visual overhaul, which introduces sleeker icons, smoother transitions, and a cleaner layout.",2
"WhatsApp is a staple in the world of messaging apps, and for good reason. Its interface is intuitive, making it easy to connect with friends and family around the globe. With features like end-to-end encryption, it ensures your conversations remain private and secure. The app's reliability and speed make it a top choice for communication, whether it's sharing updates, making voice or video calls, or sending multimedia files. Overall, WhatsApp is a must-have for staying connected in Very Good💯",2
"It's a wonderful messaging app, the most easiest and widely used so far. Please add a feature for editing the caption on WhatsApp status posts. Sometimes, I want to include or take out something from the caption on my posts and the only option is to delete the entire post. Can we have a better alternative? Many thanks!",2
"WhatsApp's latest update has brought a sleek and modern design that's a breath of fresh air! The new look is visually stunning, with a clean and minimalistic approach that makes navigation a breeze. The refreshed icon and color scheme are a nice touch, giving the app a more contemporary feel. The reorganized user interface is intuitive and easy to use, making it simpler to access features Kudos to the Meta team for delivering a fantastic update that enhances the overall WhatsApp experience!",2
"The best message app hands down. One thing I wish they added is the option to keep gifs replaying instead of pressing on them to start again. That's really pretty much it. Oh, and the little double arrow as a share symbol. I don't know why but it messes with my eyes. Looking forward to future updates! :)",2
"I have no problem with the app in it's actual sense but certain updates are bothersome. It is but only a request but would you be so kind as you change the ""chat search"" bar back to an icon or even better make it an option in settings as to whether you want a search bar or a search icon. Thank you so much! And also I really appreciate the new create sticker option, that update was revolutionary❤️ thanks for your audience.",2
"EXCELLENT APP. Messaging is so easy with this app. 💕💞. One suggested feature is when we enable protect ip address in calls, it reduces call quality. So, when we enable protect ip address feature, the call quality should not be reduced. Please improve. And please remove that new search bar. In old version the search bar was better. Also please change the navigation of the app with tabs at the top. Tabs should not be on the bottom. If does not look good. Thanks",2
"This app is pretty good, my overall experience is not that bad,, this app has changed alot ever since 2013,, that was the first time I downloaded this app I must say that they are updating the app regularly with new features. But if you delete the message which was sent mistakenly to a person,, that receiver knows that the message was deleted that is the only thing I don't like about the app I would appreciate if that would not happen. EDIT: App is getting updated too much update is not good",2
"Title: ""Amazing AI Assistant!"" Review: ""I've been using Meta AI for [insert time period] and I'm blown away by its capabilities! The AI assistant is incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, and responsive. It's like having a personal expert at your fingertips. Whether I need help with a question, a task, or just want to learn something new, Meta AI is always up for the challenge. Its ability to understand context and provide accurate answers is impressive 😊.",2
"Amazing! Works perfectly and is so reliable. 👌 I use it every day and I 'specially love the status so I can share pics and fun/exciting moments! The only thing that annoys me is that they added AI, sort of like bing, but you don't have to talk to it. I cannot comment more on the AI thingy because I haven't used it. 😅 Anyway, this app is great, and everyone I know uses it. It's so easy-to-use and it works really well!! 😺 Have a fun time messaging if you choose to download this app!! 📱💯",2
"WhatsApp is an indispensable tool in my daily communication since 2018. However, I've noticed a recurring issue regarding the degradation in picture quality when images are sent through the app. Despite the convenience and reliability of the platform, the noticeable drop in picture resolution upon sending is a concern. I hope the development team can address this issue to enhance the overall user experience. Looking forward to improvements in future updates",2
"WhatsApp Messenger, a renowned messaging app, has been a game-changer in the way we communicate. With its end-to-end encryption, users can enjoy a secure messaging experience, knowing that their conversations are private. The app's user base is vast, making it highly likely that contacts are already using the service, which simplifies communication across borders. However, it's important to note that while messages are encrypted, backups may not be, and there's the potential.",2

"I like the app. Been using it since I got my phone for the first time! Really helpful to communicate with other ppl from different places, countries, states etc... Definitely love it. Tho there is a tiny problem, tho I'm not annoyed. It's how someone updates their status and I can see it only once. It was better when they updated it and you couldn't see it only once but twice, thrice etc... Except this there is no other problem. Keep going! I rate it 5 stars. Keep going! ❤️❤️❤️",2
"My experience with WhatsApp has been incredibly positive. Its intuitive interface, wide range of features, reliability, and security have made it an essential tool for staying connected. From messaging to calls and media sharing, WhatsApp offers everything I need in one convenient platform. Its reliability ensures that messages are always delivered promptly, even in areas with poor network coverage. And knowing that my conversations are protected by end-to-end encryption gives me peace of mind",2
"The app is very cool everything is fine, 1 suggestion though, I think when it comes to backing up data, there should be an option to select the chats I want to backup. Or even just an option of either groups or personal chats because sometimes we end up backing/restoring useless chats because we have no option or even end up skipping the whole processe because we don't want some of the chats to take up space",2
"Really like the new interface of the app with the chat, calls and status tabs at the bottom, increased contrast and simpler colours. Improves one hand usage and makes the app look modern. Also really appreciate the large number of recently implemented new features which are turning this app which was once a burden for me into a really useful messaging app. Keep up the work, dev team",2
"So this is more like a request than a review : As student, we rely on WhatsApp for class communication. But there's a missing feature: the ability to make lists in the app ,that enables any member of that group to edit and add their input tho the list. This feature if implemented,would simplify tasks like taking attendance and organizing exam retests etc..thus cutting down on message overload and saving time. Please add this feature in future updates.Thanks!",2
"WhatsApp is a very useful software, I've been using it for over 15 years now. You can send text messages, set up group chats, send photos, documents, audio, and video recordings, and also make audio and video calls.There is also a web app that you can use on your computer, it allows you to use WhatsApp without having to handle your mobile phone. It's pretty secure as well, it is linked to you",2

"Finally, a dark mode that's dark. Instead of trying to optimize dark mode for both LCD and Amoled panels, I would prefer a design choice where the mode itself is optimized. If Amoleds render it better, so be it. Atleast the experience is good for Amoleds and average for LCDs, instead of being just average for every panel.",2
"It's so good April 2, 2024 There is some socket error in this app after last few updates. Messages either queue up in our device and don't get delivered to the receiver. Basically it lags the communication like hell. I am sending a message in one of my chat and it won't get delivered. It would show single tick, eventhough the receiver's device is connected to internet. And this is consistently increasing to many more features. WhatsApp was meant to be one of the fastest mode of communication",2
"Just wanna let you know the latest update theme is freaking nice. I'm using the black theme and it looks bruh stunning. Others might have different opinions so if you want to try rearrange the navigation then go on, show your creativity! But I like it as it is. The navigation is also snappy. Just that when I shared picture FROM gallery and tried to change the quality to HD, the app crashed. I also didn't checked the other features yet but I still wanna give 5 stars~ Btw I'm using Infinix X676C",2
"I love this app,it is the best app but sometimes it is annoying because you have to update it almost every year,but it is still the best sometimes, but it has some little mistakes but the mistakes are manageable at times but not every time, my also my second opinion I will like to share is that it does not receive some texts early until you turn on your data also it's data consuming do well to look into this problem and all the other people problems thanks for letting me to share my opinions.",2
"The new split view on my tablet is horrible. If some people want or like it there needs to be the option to choose the previous full screen view. I use WhatsApp daily and was very happy with it. Now it looks cluttered and confusing. I do not want to see all my contacts and messages when am reading or sending a message to one of my contacts.The app is overall amazing for communication, and it's very easy to use as well. I don't really have any issue with it, but there is this new update in tablet",2

It makes it easier usable , you don't have to use a lot of energy, it is only tap and slide and move on faster for time.",2
"Thankl've been a loyal WhatsApp user for years, and I appreciate the convenience it offers in staying connected. However, with the latest update, encountered a significant issue. I'm unable to view status updates, which has hindered my ability to engage with my contacts in the same way I used to. Additionally, I'm not a fan of the recent changes in the latest version.

The end-to-end encryption ensures privacy, while features like status updates add a fun touch.",2
"I love the app but I have feature suggestions ""I recommend adding an 'inactive status' feature to WhatsApp, which would allow users to temporarily disable message notifications and prevent the sender from seeing double ticks. This option would function similarly to uninstalling the app without actually removing it, providing users with a convenient way to take a break from messaging without losing access to their conversations.""",2
"This software is very easy to use and doesn't consume too much space in my phone. The software is very stable and i have never experience system crash from this software. Pros WhatsApp only need internet connection for sending text to my contact list or having video call with any other money charges. The quality for the video audio for the video call is in High Definition(HD) and i am very happy with it. Many of my colleague is using this software,",2

"WhatsApp is a fantastic app that I use every day for staying connected with friends and family. However, I have a suggestion for improvement. It would be great if there was a feature to freeze the last seen status. This could enhance privacy and add a touch of personalization to the app. Overall, I love WhatsApp and believe this addition would make it even better!""",2
"It's been a simple and reliable app for many years. Good and easy to use. I only wish with all these social media updates they keep adding like statuses and channels, I wish they'd give us the option to turn things off completely, like statuses. I know there's muting but it be nice to have the option to turn it off.",2
This app has every way possible to talk with someone.....it should just give an extra capacity to the photos....I wanted to change my profile pic and the entire pic wasn't fitting.....this is the only red Flagg I have.... It should also have a feature of picking up one more person's call while talking to the other....both ppl can be talked to at once as the 3 r now added together......the add option and cut and then pick up options should be different though.... Btw I ❤️ whatsapp... 😁,2
"Thank you. My previous issue about my voice volume sometimes low has been fixed. The new issue I have is when I want to change to use speaker, its indicator having delay which I have to automatically re-tap the speaker logo. But this caused I go back to normal use (without speaker). To overcome it, I just wait until the logo change to bold. Is it possible to fix via WhatsApp program or is it caused by Infinix software bug? I am looking forward to your response. Thank you.",2
"I loved the ease of use of this software and the most impactful features are the tags and the automatic message which helps a lot in business. The application is very good, great communication, easy to use, its features are very cool, compared to other applications it is excellent... very useful in everyday life. The Meta Ai felt very good to see this",2
"I've loved the new updates made recently, but there's one thing I'd like to suggest in adding to it, it's about the archive, it'll be more cool if you can make it like that of telegram which can be hidden (the point of archiving chats were mostly so we won't see the chats for a while) so that we can focus on other chat, showing up in the chat I really disturbing. Above it all nice app, really helpful ✔💯",2
"The new WhatsApp update was super cool! 😍 Highlighting the colors in the UI is absolutely awesome. However, it's a bit disappointing to see the new channels on the next slide of the status page; otherwise, it would be awesome...",2
Very straight to the point app. Still the best app so far no real competition. Few Suggestions Here: 1. Separate Chats and Groups Tabs. 2. New and updated archives feature. 3. Ability to change WhatsApp themes instead of plain dark and light modes. 4. Way to make custom caller backgrounds like on certain phones 5. Better optimization when receiving alot of messages at once. That's all i would like to see devs. Keep up the good work💯👏,2
"WhatsApp is great, the new UI is cool. If by chance one of the developers are reading this, I have a suggestion, could there be like a sorting system? Like from A-Z or grouping the contacts and groups like in phones where you could put apps in one place with the file feature thingy? I like to be organised but if that isn't possible then it's fine. Thanks for reading.",2
Arrh Whatsapp have been a very wonderful app. I'm so into it's layout. I must commend .they should continue the great work buh i would like the suggest a feature that would put the butter on the bread. If u could make it possible to choose multiple Text or images by just selecting one n sliding through the rest . It would be great rather than having to be tapping all the time,2
"Changed my life 😁 I use it more than any app and call rates are faster in a signal poor area as it ""hunts"" for communications. If it's absolutely urgent I can phone; if it is to be responded in the other persons time...it makes sense to text/voice message. Keep up with the good work as keeping up with the trends are absolutely necessary for our changing world 🌍",2
"I like this app most. Because recent updates impressed me too much basically that bottom navigation bar now i can use freely whatsapp in one hand and its interface i can't say anymore 🥰, also its working very smooth than before. New emojis were added. I really thanks to everyone and appriciate those who working on it day and night to makes this app more extensible. Now i am excitedly waiting for new meta Liema 3 ai model that how it would be.👍👍",2
"As an avid user of the call feature on WhatsApp, I occasionally find myself accidentally initiating calls due to the proximity of the call button within the app's interface. I understand that calls on WhatsApp are designed to be quick and convenient, but there have been instances where unintentional calls were made due to a momentary tap on the call button. Therefore, I would like to suggest the implementation of a confirmation prompt before initiating a call on WhatsApp.",2

"I actually loved the new update, not talking about any desire but I really required a change in such application and moreover it has been 4 years since i have using whatsapp and my experience was decent. But sometimes, for last few months the files i try to send were taking hella time to be delievered but now, literally no problem occurs and all day i love using this app chating with my friends and everyone. The channels are also very amazing. That's all to say about my feedback or rating.",2
The app is perfect but I have one concern the privacy features are no longer so effective for instance the AppLock was initially a fingerprint alone and was much safer now you added a new option of using a pin or pattern too but unfortunately the feature isn't much safe coz the same pin or pattern you use for unlocking the entire phone is the same you have to use on WhatsApp maybe be you could have considered putting an option of one setting a different pin from the common one,2

"EDIT: I don't like the new update green😫, other than that everything works great & is easy to use. I like how it auto back ups my convos and the crypto works wonders too! sometimes I have issues with adding numbers, as it says it can't find them especially if it's not my country digits",2
"If you don't have WhatsApp its time you got it. So many people and businesses in numerous countries use this as a mainstay for communication. Cheap, effective, end-to-end encryption. Secure.

"The new UI actually looks good now after they changed the colour scheme, especially in dark mode, and added the search bar. I didn't like how it looked when they first moved the chats and updates to the bottom, but now it looks far better!",2
"Good app but the misalignment on the search bar on EACH AND EVERY DEVICE hurts my soul. New update: Thanks for fixing that, and a new feature is added on androids so that you can use face unlock to unlock whtsapp. That's great, but direct sharing an image via whatsapp doesn't work. Takes you to your chats instead of the person to send it after unlocking.",2
This app is very useful and so helpful as i am connected with most of my friends and family. But i request to Whatsapp to increase the status time upto 1 minute as we have to upload many statuses of one video and one last request is that Whatsapp had to install a new feature of pin lock or pattern or password lock if Whatsapp added these features then it will be a more helpful and greatful app.Therefore i request to Meta to add these features as soon as possible Thank you so much 😊,2
"It is a very good social communication application, it needs to add a feature, most people in the group open the voice chat, the admin should introduce such a feature in the group setting that if they want to close the group voice chat. It can be turned off. Thanks",2
"I love whaatsapp for so many educative adds such as concerning ""Health""also in the area of charts and sending of messages across to loved ones and getting replies almost immideately is quite interesting too,so many other features inclussiive,but the areas that borders one most are the "" cleaning apprratus""they disturbs a lot for their repiititions/non stopping, else,as time goes on more issues 'll be pointed ,i equally encourage to cntinue doing your very best as nothing is ""perfect""That of past",2
"WhatsApp is a great app, I've loved it over the years, but I have issues with the search bar. I can't search for a message once I scroll down, I have to go back up to search. Can it just be reverted to a search icon? Secondly, my status doesn't update with time anymore, I can't see time like ""5 minutes ago, just now"" and so. This has been ever since I updated the WhatsApp. It's still like that, can that be fixed? Kudos for the Meta AI, I love it",2
"I kinda like the new update how they actually changes their ui and ux design system. Switch between light and dark theme. Also they changes their colours system both light and dark theme now the app is much more easier and readable. Bottom app bar was much smoother.. Basically now the app is much easier, readable and colours are awesome ♥️♥️.. I like it",2
"Thank you, Meta, for adding so many features to WhatsApp. I want to give you my suggestions, maybe they'll be helpful. We can only react in the WhatsApp channel, it doesn't feel good if we don't have access to reply. If we get the ability to comment on every message, it will be great! We'll also like it, and the channel owner will also get feedback.And another thing, if the reply style is like how Meta AI replies, it would be great! I mean, just like how AI replies and the three dots animate.",2

One of WhatsApp's greatest strengths lies in its cross-platform functionality. Hope you like",2
"Hey, great app for my needs. Can you add a reminder option for chats??? Just need that one thing to get stuff done. Im thinking like i can add a reminder on my wifes that so both of us get a whatsapp reminder that we need to get groceries done saturday afternoon, Kinda thing. Just saying. You guys do thinking on how and what it should look like.",2
The new Meta AI feature is supercool. I told someone that this is akin to a child having his/her school teacher right there with him/her in the playground. I wish to ask that the AI chat area should be configured in a way that conversations can be categorised based on the theme of discussion and saved as well. These conversations can be revisited in the future and one can pick up from where he/she stopped previously. This will overcome the present long and single chat area that's present.,2
"The recent AI feature in WhatsApp is mind-blowing. It is available in my phone but not in my other phone(Redmi Note 5 Pro). It is updated also buy yet it is not available. Please introduce that too. The AI feature is awesome and I am looking forward to developing the AI. Please keep the AI and never remove it. Sincere request. Note: This AI can also solve many physics, chemistry maths questions too although some inaccuracy may remain but process is correct.",2
"Please, I'm begging you, give me an option to completely remove or disable meta ai. For some reason I don't have that option at all. I've been googling, searching in my settings, and even asked the ai itself, but there is no way for me to do it. Please make a way, WhatsApp programmers. Thank you for your help and support (P.S. I'm on a huawei device ) .",2
Good. Have a suggestion. New editing feature is great but a shortcut should be made for it. Swipe right is assigned for replying a perticular text. Swipe left could be assigned for editing.,2
I had hated this Whatsapp since they banned GBs and I had to use it by force but at the moment am in love with it's new features to extent that though GB is brought back to existence I can't leave Messenger. but I was requesting that they add for us an online toss show like how GB used to do it. Am happy with the changes you have made to make Messenger also more interesting waw,2
"Whatsapp is one of the best, if not the best messaging apps on the internet! It is simple yet detailed in a way, and is a massive step up from the default messaging app on your phone.

It is one kind of message repeater to send message repeatedly, and also you can set your repetition limit with new line text repetition.

Thank You .",2
"Overall this App is best . Although i would like to share one suggestion for the developer team of WhatsApp. My point is to Adding a customised list (in status privacy) . So, that we as an user can make & save a list (like School, college, office guys ) so that I would not have to struggle for removing saved person or adding new person. So that, whenever I have to add status. By simply choosing my college list , my status would be seen to my college colleagues only.",2
"Hello I previously asked for the edit option in messages and it was updated later. Now with the new update, the security and privacy of the app has been compromised. I suggest WhatsApp should only have fingerprint lock and not the option of using pin to unlock it. As one may know my pin but he/she can never have my fingerprint to unlock whatsapp. Kindly review this update and remove the option of unlocking with pin. Thank you.",2
Overall app is very good... but need one additional features for fast forwarding the status video because if we have to see only the last part of some status video it need to watch it again whole video so fast forwarding or any other option for this is required.....and overall performance is good voice quality is also good for voice message the latest feature of correcting the sent message has blown my mind it is really a very good feature.. Thanks for this team what's app.,2
"Highly recommend if you want to keep in touch with friends and family overseas. It is free in Australia so I can not speak for other countries I love that I can be talking to my friends in Japan who don't speak good English and me i only speak English, so the app translates our language to each other so cool Yes, sometimes when it translates shortened down words, the app doesn't understand, and it tries but gets it a little messed up us. Is funny 😁 I enjoy the app",2

It's good and private and doesn't allow anyone to intrude which is good because we use these Apps to allow us to do business and our personal stuff...but at the very same time please it shouldn't be too complicated for the elderly as we know that technology is a new thing to them. Change is good but please keep it simple so it can be easy for anyone to use it. Please make it easy as well for the Deafblind people so that it accommodates everyone.,2
"Whatsapp is my most used application, recently you updated calls setting, when someone is offline and not connected with wifi or data, so it shows calling and when connected with wifi or data then shows ringing, now after your recent update it shows ringing for in both condition, now we are very confused, how to know, second person is receiving our call or not, so you are requested to change this setting as previous. Thank You.",2
"Best and awesome app for communications.🌏 Everything is available in it from callings to chattings.📞 You can do video call 🎦,voice call ☎️and group call too! You can send pics 🖼,videos📸 ,files 📁,pdfs 🗃and anything you want! The layout and interface is too smooth and easy to use There is no better way of communication except Whatsapp Messenger. Its name suggests what's in it. I'd happily n persuasively recommend to everyone who are looking for a messaging, calling app in one.☺☺🥰",2
"Although I don't like the channels option which can not be hidden and the new status viewing layout, I find the application as the best.... Please allow hiding option for channels and also allow the option of having old status viewing layout.",2
"The app is great it allows to communicate which is great but there is one thing which bothers me. The fact that I can't blur messages yes there's the ""disappear picture"" option but what if they made a ""blur message"" option for those wondering eyes, that would be something... But that's all just a suggestion from a loyal user.",2
"Do something about the ""edit"" option for the texts.. It's too much of an effort to edit texts and I'm sure so many people mistakenly type wrong spellings all the time, it should be one click away, that way it'll be wayy more convenient.. My best suggestion would be to swipe left on sent text for edit.",2
"Good concept. FIXED 5 Star Terrible incall headset functionality. Tested with Samsung s20 and Galaxy buds+, as well as Sony whxb900n. When in a call the end call input from the headsets doesn't work. It just breaks the headset connection to the mobile device. Furthermore, sometimes upon ending the call from the mobile device the headsets remain in incall mode and are unusable for listening to music.",2
"I would love to see a feature that enables you to search for a particular message(s) or docs from a particular person in a group chat. A feature in group chat that when you select a particular member in the group, you can see all the messages and docs he or she posted on the WhatsApp group. It will minimize the stress of scrolling up and down trying to find a particular message or doc that was posted by a member long time ago. Using Mr A's name to search for his post 3months ago will be ease.",2
"I think something is wrong with my account all the other apps on my device are operating normally but this apps is not. It has suddenly stopped operating and all I get is ""check your connectivity setting and try again. ""I have data on my device so how come it's not responding positively... I can status neither can I send massages for they remain pending",2
Messages are sent without any charges to any part of the world provided internet is available on mobile devices. • No advertisements on the screen to annoy the user. Disadvantages • There is no option to hide from particular users. • It is not possible to send messages into normal inbox of the mobile phone. • There is a risk of anyone reading the message meant for you only. This often creates problem in the happy home.,2
"Dear, in other vivo mobile phones, Whtsapp displays Ai option, however mobiles with low storage capacity as having 4/64 does not show such option. Is this variance comes by having mobile with low storage capacity or it does not matter whatever mobile be, WhatsApp will display Ai option in days to come. Such clarification needs to be confirmedely circulated. Thanks",2
"WhatsApp Messenger redefines communication with its intuitive interface and diverse features, encompassing text, voice, and video messaging, along with seamless media sharing. 📱 Despite sporadic connectivity hiccups and privacy debates, I appreciate its speed, reliability, and robust encryption, making it my premier choice for global connectivity. 🌍😁😊",2
"This new feature is very nice, I tested it and thought it was just a little helpful, as if it had a media option we would have got more help. User should get permission only for his own image so that no one can misuse it from someone else's image.",2
"It's a really good app Buh it still need somethings like texting and sending stickers at the same time like most of the times I use emojis, I don't really mean them but instead a sticker is possibly the best way to show your current emotion or something just try to make it possible to send both texts and stickers at the same time Like the text on top and the sticker below 😌",2
"I like the meta AI which helps me type messages better and it can do way more than that, it can also generate images to send, which will reduce the hassle of searching the image or a greeting manually using the search engine, and then downloading it and then sending it! Great job Meta team! What a great idea integrating AI with WhatsApp 👍😃",2
"More easier for connectivity requirements, it really has a great improvement with our conversation and transactions, great departments goes for great memories and moves. It's really acting awesome toward life satisfaction in this modern business era. Thank you for your moves and updates regarding appreciations.",2

"They added a feature called stories. No one wanted this. It has a notification that takes forever to get to play. After playing it, the notification will sit on your screen for all eternity. Can't delete it. Can't archive it. Nothing. It will sit at the top of your app forever. Otherwise the ap is, acceptable. It does what it does, but having an unclearable notification stuck on my screen is the most frustrating thing, and makes me want to ininstall",0
So far a great app. Just one issue. Random chat clears and losing everything important from chat. Can never get it back. The person I talk with didn't clear the chat and neither did I. So there has to be an issue. Developers please fix this problem. My friend and I lost a lot of important info and pictures from. The random chat clear problem is a real issue. Fix this please and find a way to get clear chats back.,0
"Very very disappointed, i hate telegram app now. I switched from Whatsapp to telegram due to cloud facilities and so on . But now I find it was my worst decision in life. I sent a message which one is still pending. Although my wifi connection has no problem but telegram doesn't work. I don't why man this app gets stuck when I try to send any photo. Photos and videos take 1 or 2 hr to download and send. They gave priorities to premium users, its ok but give a chance to others to use hassle free.",0
"Takes hours to disable everything that annoys you, paid features are completely useless, uncomfortable user interface, horrible search, too many restrictions, I can go on and on but this app truly sucks and records WAY too much information about you, burns through too much battery, tracks location without asking (unless you turn it off) and does not, in any way, explain what data it collects nor offers you to disable tracking and advertisement. Used to he an ok app, not anymore!",0
"One upon a time it was great. But now it's greedy with subscription models. Can't say your msgs are as safe as they were just a few years ago. And now a new update means searching for things is more difficult as the search arrows were moved from a good space on the bottom bar to displaying over messages that you may want to read. DL and UL speeds are limited, so you might as well never send or receive. Tldr Tele has gone greedy and doesn't care about privacy or user experience.",0
Update 3/2024 - From bad to worse. No messages won't load until you type a message back or at least a character to get the message to appear. You can see part of the message in the preview but when you go into messages there's nothing there until you send something 1/30/22 - clipboard no longer works. Latest update forces contacts on the same screen as chats. Super inconvenient and really annoying.,0
The app has gotten progressively worse with updates. It will not upload messages. I have voice note messages spinning for months even with good wifi signal. This is garbage. I do not recommend it any more. I have switched over to Signal which has the same features and works well every time. I don't have time to waste with developers who do not prioritize the users experience over their own goals.,0
"My phone got hacked via telegram; so I was forced to uninstall it, and then my phone started working normally again ✨😌 Whoever develops this app needs to work on the safety of it; cause the same thing has never happened to me via Whatsapp, even though I've used it for many years, and connected with many new people across the world through it. I don't know why my phone was hackable via telegram; however that's for the developers of this app to work out, not me. I hope this issue gets fixed!",0
"It started to shut down yesterday. Even after I uninstalled and reinstalled it. It doesnt allow me to send some gifs which it colored in dark black in a channel however it allows others which it displays with regular color. Also, some gifs are deleted, I assume it did it. Its full of bugs, glitches, it interferes with the phone too much, its not trustable. Beware!",0
"After the latest update, extreme freezing issues, notifications sometimes pause and disappear from the notification list. People can steal your username and sell it. If you're away for more than a month, it deletes all data. The support team doesn't respond to anything, and you'll regularly get spam messages, invites to dangerous groups, and people messaging who are only miles away in real life (even if you block this using settings).",0
"Connecting... Also stories are bloated nonsense. The devs may chime in saying they take up no extra space and can be muted. This is a lie. Stories from Telegram cannot be hidden, and you cannot mute that channel, and it is pushed to your device regardless, and even AFTER you've watched, it still shows up on the UI as ""1 Story"". Not sure how they qualify that as taking up no space, when it's right there, taking up space, for 24 hours even after it's been viewed.",0
"The last update is awful, overloaded with useless, distracting pop-ups and highlights (on quoted msg and link preview). Reply-to also lost its bookmark function. How do I turn all of them OFF??? BTW I also hate how double-tap Quick Reactions cannot be turned off. I'm paying for this app, yet I'm still kept being insulted with new ""features"" that clearly marking me as the product. Please stop!",0
"Constant connection issues have made this app so hard to use even with good connection. Getting on the app it'll be stuck connecting for a few minutes, sending messages through notifications can mean they never send until you open the app, and random disconnects even while on the app has made me really hate this app since the last updates as this wasn't a problem until then. Fix this issue and then maybe I'll increase the rating.",0
"Telegram offers more versatility than Whatsapp, and more user friendly. However, recently, the app doesn't seem to actively sync with server - the contact / channel appears to have no new messages for whole day, but when u click the contact / channel, then the app would sync and show u all the unread messages in the past 1 day. This happens to both desktop app and mobile app, despite that no change in the settings have happened. Sent a support request, and it was not entertained.",0
"I am extremely disappointed with Telegram's performance and speed, warranting a 1-star review. Despite having a premium membership and granting all necessary permissions, the download and upload speeds on the app are excruciatingly slow. Even with a strong Wi-Fi connection and other apps functioning seamlessly on my phone, Telegram lags behind, failing to deliver the basic functionality expected from a messaging platform. This lack of efficiency is unacceptable, especially for a paid service, an",0
"Been using telegram since 2015 and this is the worst version from almost 4 months ago. Changed a group to topic view: 1. Searching is messed up. search inside a channel, it gives a global search 2. If you search and the above happens, you need to go back and retry. Correct results appear, but you tap it, it won't open up, need to retry 3. Pinned messages gone mad. Sometimes shows 40 pinned, sometimes 15, sometimes 70 Doesn't show pinned before making view as topic ""General"" is deleted in search",0
"A couple years ago it was a great messenger app, but after Premium thing happened, everything became more and more unusable. It crashes, messages take forever to load, it's laggy, it's annoying, 10% of my messages just don't show up in search results, big screenshots are unreadable on the phone but look fine-ish kn desktop, as well as other stuff. Planning on moving to Matrix, but honestly, who cares.",0
"It's getting worse with each update. Media download speed gets ridiculously slow, unable to manage local storage, option to select external storage disappeared; doesn't even load in-app emojis. My internet connection is stable and fast, it's the app's issue. Would not recommend anymore. In fact, I'd gladly uninstall this nonsense app if a lot of my contacts weren't using it. Shame.",0
"When are you going to fix the call problems?? So much bugs and it's been for years since this isn't fixed yet, audio problems still occur and I'm so fed up with it. Also when I do screen sharing, there is also this problem when I turn it off, the audio of my caller goes off after that even the microphone is on. It's been years now and don't make me say such words I don't wanna say cuz literally, I'm almost there to the point y'all never like it.",0
"Well... the app actually is a sensation... it's compatibility with crypto-currency, and of course it's Privacy Features which is so far unmatched... AND IT MUST BE 5+ STARS!!!! BUT:!! When I'm using bots the sensitivity of the screen suddenly changes and when I try to navigate (like go up and down) all of a sudden it just closes the bot... so I have to do everything again and again... Please do something about it... Telegram deserves to do much better than this...",0
"The app is buggy, for instance after downloading a file, i try to open it it starts again to download over and over again, if its a video i download it and play it on apps inbuilt media player but when i save it to my phone it says please download file first. It is not only unique to the device im currently using but on multiple devices i use and have used in the past",0
"For some reason, even though I turn notification settings to silent for everything in this app, the sounds and vibration keep getting turned back on. This is really annoying. How hard is it to just have the notification indicator without the sound? Other apps seen to be able to do this just fine.",0
"Have had this app for years with no issues and enjoyed it. One day, out of the blue, I had been logged out. When I attempted to log back in, it said that my phone number had been banned. I was given no reason why, and I had not done or said anything wrong to anyone! I emailed telegram several times asking why and have never had a response! Absolutely zero customer service or care.",0
"I am very unhappy with this app. It has so many bugs and issues that make it unusable. It often fails to log in or connect to the internet, even when I have a good connection. It also doesn't show the messages that I receive in the chat, only in the notifications. And the media files, like videos and images, never download or open. This app is a waste of time and space. I don't recommend it to anyone. Please fix these problems or I will uninstall it.",0
"I use this app a lot, but there are just too many bugs. Firstly, anonymous admins cannot send reactions. Secondly, the pinned message tab disappears randomly and it takes a while for it to reappear. Thirdly, the chat history sometimes bugs out and doesn't show the latest date and instead brings me to another date in the past. Lastly, i cannot view grp info in chats with topics enabled. FIX THE BUGS PLS",0
"Unable to see the automatically downloaded photos, videos and documents, Which are easily available in earlier version. So, Dear Telegram manager, Please look into this issue(Automatically downloaded data, which is available earlier in Telegram section of MY FILE, now it's not even showing all folders), So please resolve this issue at the earliest.",0
"I've been using it for almost 7 years now and it was always making communication in my life very fast and convenient. I am glad I chose telegram and I definitely don't plan to switch for anything else. UPD (1 STAR): I am a telegram premium user and I have my last seen hidden from others. But I turned this feature on precisely because I don't want to see last seen of other users. How can I, after the recent update, turn off this supposedly desired feature? I don't see any way to do it in theapp",0
"Why is the proximity sensor active when I have a call on speaker phone!? So extremely infuriating. Let me have my screen on! Who has their phone up to their ear when it's on speaker phone? No one ever. Often when speaker phone is active people are checking something on their phone too, unfortunately made impossible only during Telegram calls.",0
Worst experience. First the chats were not loading even on best connection. It was always showing connecting. So I uninstalled and reinstalled the app but then it won't let me login. Loading is stuck on contact number and won't go any further. I suggest you fix these issues as soon as possible and maybe I will change my mind about using this app.,0
"I don't know what is happening with the app these days. Everytime time I open it to have a look, it takes forever to update. I tried logging in from different devices but the condition persists. I tried to uninstall and then reinstall it but nothing worked. Kindly fix the issue or suggest any measure. It sucks. I don't know what the hell happened with it. I have all my data in it, and important notes. Please address the issue.",0
"Extremely disappointed with the telegram performance...... it's actually showing ""connecting..."" Although I have a good network speed but still it's not working.....it's very very slow.... it's not catching the network properly.... definitely some bug fixes are needed ... telegram is very slow now ... uploading video audio... texting.... everything is so slow..... please work upon that otherwise I will uninstall this app",0
"This app used to be great, but now they have blocked the setting of being able to only receive calls or messages from contacts behind a pay wall. So now if you don't pay for their subscription, you just receive calls and texts from anyone, which means that you receive non-stop SCAM messages from thousands of scammers. They should rename this app to TeleSCAM. I'm moving on from this app. I think that telegram blocking our ability to not receive thousand of scammer's messages is despicable.",0
"Telegram has the worst video meeting experience, 1st it doesn't handle configuration changes (android devs, hello), also sometimes video of the opponent side is just disappear and getting black, and it works only after a wrap around (turn on/off video several times) 2nd delayed messages are not working offline (if I for example made a delayed message and doesn't connected to the network it wouldn't be sent 😔) Please fix it, I hope that telegram will develop it at the nearest future and will...",0
"My account keeps getting restricted because apparently, I have been sending annoying messages to strangers and advertising on other's accounts. I don't have anything to advertise and don't send messages to anyone I don't know. The only time I went to another's page was when they had an open invitation but I stopped responding to them because they wanted money. Someone needs to contact me to resolve this problem.",0
"I've bought a brand new phone number and opened a new telegram account, to everyone's surprise it's spam, after a while it logged out itself automatically. When I wanted to open it back there was this line ""Sorry, this phone number is banned"". Then I reported this issue. After half an hour, I could open a new account. Still, I only can message to mutual contacts. Besides, I can't create a new telegram channel or group.",0
The app is fantastic..but my data is deleted by mistake and I am not able to recover it...please do something about I have messaged multiple times in telegram support to recover data..they haven't got back to me..the days that is deleted is sensitive data..may be telegram does not loose anything by deleting data ..but it would cost me a lot if it's not recovered..request to please recover my data.,0
"Facing issue of very slow download speed for every item(image, video, music and document). Whatever the speed of internet or WiFi, not able to download files. Second thing telegram is good application for students for study purpose and everyone can't afford Telegram Premium, so I request developers that they should provide service as they are providing before launching of telegram premium. Else we have to find other alternative of Telegram for our use.",0
"It was great once. That time is over. Once Telegram declared itself as a safe place for free communication. It's not safe anymore since they closely cooperate with governments (Germany, India); it's not free (WhatsApp and Signal do not push adds to you); it's slow in showing videos; it misses calls and so on. Try to find alternative.",0
After recent update. There is big bugs or problem in there. Someone's messages is automatically sending to someone else. And someone else is sending me text everytime. Everyone is sending their messages to their dear ones but the messages are got delivered to someone else. Very very serious issue is there. Please solve it as soon as possible.,0
"Very poor experience. My downloaded files are redownloading again and again when I am trying to save to my gallery. Trying for three months and still facing the problem. Thought of bug or any other technical issue, I updated and reinstalled many times and also deleted catchies but facing the same issue no other option only way is to use other better apps. Thank You🙏",0
"The option to limit who can message you to just your contacts is locked behind a paywall, and so without paying, anyone on the app can message you and send you spam/Phish. It is insane that the Telegram team thought that was something reasonable to charge money for, and I'm incredibly disappointed in everyone behind that decision.",0
"I would like to rate zero star, if there an option available. I don't know what happened for this app in these days.. extremely very bad speed with an high speed network & wifi connection.. YouTube downloads are in 5-10 Mbps..in first few minutes showing a below avg speed and after a 10% download complete,the downloading has been stuck..I'm trying mrng 11 to night 12 am( the time is right now 12:15 am 13th March).. Very very bad",0
I am not been able to see the files downloaded over the app in my file manager. I tried reinstalling this app again but I am not been able to see telegram folder in my file manager. Please fix this issue. This creates a lot of problems since I need to search the same file over telegram again and again. This recent update is worse I think since previous update has folder but now no telegram folder is there. Please fix this issue. Otherwise app is great 👍,0
Now a days the app is not working properly. All the other apps in my phone working smoothly without telegram. I tried to reinstall the app but now I am unable to login myself. There are so many data of mine are in the app and I haven't download to my phone. So please try to fix these problems as soon as possible.,0
"Why is logging in telegram so difficult? From we sent an sms to your other telegram device (i have just one device) to internal error occurred, to unable to send sms. Even when it manages to send a code to my email address, I input the correct code then it goes back to internal error occurred again. This has been over 2 months with the same repeated error messages even after updating my app and trying other mobile numbers. Fix your login process pls.",0
"I would make a guess and say 90% of your users find the ""contact joined telegram"" thing very, super, extremely redundant and annoying yet you guys have refused to work on that. I can volunteer to join your team and help you work on it. Meanwhile, I'm moving to signal.",0
"When did telegram start this nonsense?????? I downloaded 4 movies and as I clicked on ""save to download"" so as to save to my internal storage, it started downloading all over again. I updated my app, same issue. This is frustrating and a waste of my data.",0
"Constant disconnects. Only works 1 in 10 times. Complete waste of time. Makes communication take days. Have switched to Signal and omw it is stable, never any delays/disconnects and completely secure. Just saying.",0
Everyone please delete this app. This MF app has reduced the downloading speed for users who haven't purchased premium. The downloading speed has reduced drastically that I was really pissed off. If this is not intentional the developers have to fix this. This was a very good app before a couple of months. If the developers provide us a decent download speed then I will uninstall this from my phone after deleting my telegram account.,0
Despite having a great internet connection I am unable to use this app...it sometimes gets struct for no reason and on trying to get back online...it fluctuates between updating and connecting... Fed up of this issue... And there is nothing to help me on app... Eagerly waiting for the solution...,0
"I've been using this app for more than 5 years, but it's getting more and more messy over time. As someone who does business on this application, I can say that this application is very rubbish, sorry. I know about banned channels, it happens if we are not active for a long time on that channel. However, my group for business purposes just DISAPPEARED even though it always active. Like.. what did I do wrong? Sorry, this is all really messed up. Can you guys hear this criticism? Ha ha ha ha.",0
"The latest update destroyed notification settings and made them basically nonfunctional. Telegram is now everything it promised to fight against when it started. It's bloated and sucks up memory and storage just to be the least responsive messaging app today. It keeps releasing useless ""features"" nobody asked for. Moderation and support are practically non-existent, and when they do something it's to ban legitimate users or forcibly steal their groups/channels while scammers roam free.",0
"I don't understand why you can't access your files using file manager again, It used to be a very good app but when I got a new phone I couldn't view my files unless I save them. I think it needs to be fixed because it is a major problem.",0
"This is worst app ever, I'm even unable to login to the app. I tried to login couple of times and waiting for hours but still searching mood. I working app on another device I'm also unable to find new contact or add someone. After opening the app it starts getting connecting for hours and hours. Such a bad experience 👎👎👎",0
"Telegram is actually encouraging scammers to exploit people by providing highly secured features. Employee or ex-employee of Telegram app are using the security features to there advantage and trying to read the messages even when user types. I think it's high time for government's to take action against this app. This app is not at all secure. Scammers are always monitoring you. Google also need to look into this aspect of the app. Even though it has many users, this app is highly vulnerable",0
"Full of Scamming message... and all contact is in the list even though no chat sometimes just telling they joint telegram. What a nonsense... start working on simplifying the app, removing unnecessary function, for better user experience.",0
"Telegram experience was very beautiful and smooth until I woke up one day to see my mobile number had been banned. I have contacted twitter customer care, sent emails, and tried and tried, all to no avail. Not even a single response. Please I'm begging, unban my mobile number. I don't want to loose all my important activities, I'm begging. It's been 2 weeks already",0

"I dislike the formation of this app, in times of security. It will sent code to other telegram app even literally the app code sent to have uninstalled or not available any longer.

"I have used it for about two years now, and it has been a great experience until about a month ago. A month ago, I got a new phone, and with it, a new number, unfortunately. Turns out, that new number was banned, and despite several emails, and even trying to talk to their support on Twitter, I have not had anyone answer or help. Thank you Telegram, very cool. Edit: Did what was recommended, still nothing. Imagine that.",0
Wrost app ever !! I don't know why i am unable to log in into the telegram. Even though i tried many times and put my phone number a plenty of times but the blue tick is always shown buffering. And never get me log in. Worst experience ever.,0
"Although I emailed support but no one answered:/ There is a security hole in the web version,people shouldn't be able to download from restricted groups, but you can use save as from browser Also, there is a bug which when you open telegram, you have to close and reopen it to show chats correctly or ui is broken:|",0
App is amazing but only one issue. I usually receive many messages from frauds but when we message some one for asking abt something new to the person who already shared a link in the group or so where but telegram do block us and gives warning but after some time blocks and not give any chance to message again and explain. Telegram asks to mail but never reward for this. I tried max but telegram fails to resolve this they shud work for this.,0
It was good before but nowadays group chats aren't shown untill we personally message on group. Although I can receive notifications of chats but it isn't shown in group. I thought it was for sometime but now it's been a week. It's still like this 😡 . I'm uninstalling this app,0

"I do not care about Telegram ""Stories"" feature. Telegram itself uses this to send their own updates to me, which means there is always a stupid story waiting for me. And it will not go away until I dismiss it, but I can't just dismiss it quickly because they have designed it so that I have to painstakingly wait for each segment of the story to play. Rotten scummbags. I stopped using Telegram. We moved to another app.",0

"Telegram is a wonderful app. But I am giving one star only, as there are lot of fake channels regarding share market. They give attractive but fake promises to retail investors. Ones you attract to their fake promises you lose your hard earned money. I personally attracted towards such 2 channels on telegram and lost my money. But I can’t express myself on these channels. I request Telegram, to start one forum for each channel so that anyone can express their experiences about these channels",0

After fews days of working normally it goes most pathetic ever, It doesn't show messages when I open notifications,It takes hours and hours and Hours to send a single freaking message.

I have reinstalled app four days ago and it doesn't moved from signing in.Plz rectify it.",0
"Fix connecting issue, even though my connection is not problem, and also the connection to the server is very slow, when loading images/uploading images/videos it is also very slow, in contrast to other social media which are fast. and its harmful to use vpn because if you make a mistake, such as using an exchange or bank, you account could be blocked, not commensurate with the risk ratio",0
Telegram is not connecting for audio and video calls in a normal range of network. It needs a highspeed internet connection which is very difficult to normal network users. While calling it always says RECONNECTING OR LOW SIGNAL. It seems the app is very heavy for a normal network. But in the same network whatsapp smoothly works for audio and video calls... Please update this issue... now app is very heavy for calls. Thanks,0
I'm facing this issue from last few months. As soon as I send a message to my contact it tooks a minute to receive to the opposite person eventhough my internet speed is excellent..this makes me very very disappointed 😞.. 2. When I enter into telegram application it shows blank page without any conversations with my contacts after force stopping multiple times only it shows ...😐,0

I've been trying for 2 months now to log into my 2nd account by adding it to the app but it keeps telling ""internal server error occurred, try again later"".

"I'm about to loss my account but Telegram is forcing me to buy premium version just to send me SMS on my registered mobile number, wow that's sus, you guys have Outstanding Cloud and here you are saying 'Due to high demand in your area You can't right send SMS but if you buy premium version than it's okay ? it's hard to digest, please do the needful if possible that not fair, i can't afford 1400/- Inr for Premium.",0

"Let me explain what i want to see on Telegram.. I Would Like To Recommend You To Start A Telegram Savings Service With Telegram Premium Payments.

"I recently got a new phone and tried to log into my previous account while forgetting the account's password. Even if I click ""Forgot password?"", It literally told me to reset my account with important information in there. Telegram needs to approve this feature. Overall, the app is a bit boring.",0
"Hi telegram, there's an annoying bug lately that makes me can't send any message to someone that's not from my contact (non-contact) even though I never spam or send something 'strange'. I can't make groupchat too and can't setting the groupchat, I've already contacted the spam bot for many times I can't count it anymore at this point but the bug keeps coming back! It's bothering me so much. Even my friends have the same issues, we already sent our complain to the Spam Bot but the limit is still",0
"Story is annoying, and there isn't a way to shut it off. Telegram is starting to get on my nerves, now they started showing ads on group chats!!. I will delete my account soon if they didn't stop this nonsense. Forcing the premium subscription's ads is not acceptable too---and now there is an annoying beep whenever playing or stoping a voice messages",0
"I've noticed 2 problems: 1st: Downloads are taking forever and even with the app open the process stops and I have to click multiple times to stop it and then restart it. It happens with all kinds of files. 2nd: Even if the ""online"" status is inactive the app still shows that we are online. What's the point? My app is always updated and these issues are from other versions but I expected it to be solved soon. It didn't.",0
"It is a good app to start for a lot of things but there is one thing that is not good. One of my friends downloaded it for some reason but he grew so addicted to it. He spends about 17 hours on telegram. His life has been ruined. I tried to convince him but he is not ready to do anything aboit it. These are the crucial years for his career and he is wasting his time on it. He sleeps on 3 am,due to this his health is depleting . At last i just want the developers to set a time limit. Thanks a lot",0
"What's the issue with the subscribe button. I have been trying to subscribe to premium, it has been giving me issue, and why did the price just increased, I have been using premium, the price isn't suppose to increase at my end as I'm not new to it",0
"Now the new issue is when I downloading an file above 100mb and back to home screen the download is in the process there is no issue but even download was finished the app is consuming the data continuously, consuming data isn't stopped after the download was completed. Sometimes i want to download 250mb file it's download completed, and data consumed about 2gb for that file. So background isn't affordable consuming more data worst app. WhatsApp is better than telegram.",0
"I'm having trouble changing my profile picture on Telegram. Even after reinstalling and updating the app, I can't make any changes. This is frustrating me a lot. 😡I've given Telegram a 1-star rating because of this. I really need this fixed as I rely on Telegram for communication. Please help me as soon as possible. 🙏",0
Been using this app for business and suddenly am logged out same happened for my two numbers and now I can't access my business contacts or channel contacted recovery support over two weeks but no response I don't feel safe or secure using telegram if I can just be logged out at any time currently can't contact my clients I rate zero stars just no option for that,0
"I have Telegram installed on both my phone and tablet. I do not require notifications on my tablet, so I've disabled them through the Android settings. However, Telegram is now showing me a large notification every time I open the application on my tablet, which is quite annoying.",0
"Telegram does not engage with customer support what so ever. I got a new phone #, updated my account, everything was fine... until a few minutes later I was suddenly banned. I've sent four emails. No response. I've lost my account just by changing my phone carrier. Telegram will absolutely not help you after a wrongful ban. It's been well over 2 weeks since my appeals. Don't waste your time with this app. They will not help you should anything go wrong.",0
"My account was banned (and deleted) in a flash.. I am still surprised at the happening and I really wish to know why you can go ahead to ban someone's phone number for reasons that are not communicated. It is unfair and should be looked into with immediate effect. Otherwise, this app already has a medal of worst user/customer reliability - which means poor service rendition and that should see you disqualified and deleted from the app stores just so you can understand the feeling. 😡",0
"I agree telegram is a good app. But what I'm not satisfied is there is no active support system for user grievances. It takes days, months, years to get help from team, many users experience this issue. I approach team about my issue but there's no response at all. I urge team to set up active support system asap.",0
"My phone was erased, so I had to redownload loads of apps. I downloaded telegram and I can't seem to get through. I'm supposed to be called and given a code, but the call hasn't come even after waiting for hours. Plus I wanted to say, why not send a message to the number instead of calling.? That'll be so much better and it'll save time.",0
"I reinstalled the app after my phone was reset to factory settings; however, I could no longer login. It kept saying that there's ""an internal error"" and ""Unable to send SMS"". I tried reaching out to Telegram support several times but no one ever replies. Awful!",0
It feels so bad that telegram forces you to go for it's premium membership. Am already tired of the speed it allows us for download any kind of media which is very very slow that even my 5G connection works like 2G in Telegram app.If they cannot just allow us the full speed they should even increase the speed of downloading just a little bit more so that we don't feel forced for upgrading to it's premium membership plan! If the team of Telegram reading it i would like to them to do something.,0

"this is starting to get ridiculous I've followed dozens of tutorials online to try to fix this issue and I'm getting really annoyed, I can't save anything! The app gives me the option to save to downloads or save to gallery but neither of those options work, if I want to save a meme from one friend and text it to my other friend I can't even get it off the app! seriously I'm at my wit's end",0
"Each and every update randomly messes up new features. Good app sometimes but progressively getting worse. Seemingly attempting to become a social media app and each new update breaks older systems. Image search does not work. Gif search is bloated with gifs of random things unrelated to searches. Random crashes, freezes, ""connecting..."" loops.. the music player is nearly completely unfunctional and the progressingly worse functionality is a serious issue.",0
"While I've always been a user and fan of telegram, the new update is very frustrating. When you reply on a message forwarded from a channel it leaves the chat and goes to channel, and often ends up stuck, and can't load that channel It constantly fails to load chats and channels and groups, for some reason it starts happening after a few minutes of use and I have to completely close and restart the program. This is only happening on the new android version.",0
"I love this app and use it every day. One thing I cannot figure out is if there's a setting to scale the main page. There's an option to increase the fonts inside the chat, but not the fonts of the group names, people I chat with. It would be gretif that option was available and worked independent of the App Resize on Android that affects this.",0
"The app automatically updates and messes up settings. This should not be happening. There was just an update recently and now I can't use emojis. I hearted (❤️) a message and come back in and it's gone. This has happened to me numerous times. Please fix this issue. Meanwhile, is there a way that I can get an update secure. When I go to Google, it doesn't say that I can update it. I'm concerned that if I uninstall and reinstall it, that I'm going to lose everything.",0
"I like to keep my notifs for this app off because I get so many messages all day long. I like to check them on my own when I have time. Ever since the most recent update however every time I open the app it asks me if I want to turn on notifications over and over and there is no way to stop it. It doesn't have a ""don't show again"" button like it should. It's really annoying and ruins my enjoyment of your app. I'll switch back to Whatsapp if they can't fix this FAST. Thanks in advance.",0
"Don't know why. But the recent week, the calls disconnect and recent days the images I send, are still loading. Should have option to un install the recent update. Every update is worse, notifications won't work + too many setting switch double switches for app/in phone. All calls not showing on full screen! Notification popup sometimes isn't working And setting in the phone for telegram is confusing and double of buttons 4every notification Some calls I get, I don't get sound in. sound out OK",0
It used to be perfect. It keeps saying connecting when I am clearly on either data or wifi! Everything else works and is fast. It gives me phone notifications of displayed new messages but I cannot see them in the app (Even as I type this). I cannot also send photos/videos. It sits and has the x with the white outlined circle going on forever,0
"I love this app, but it has been having a consistent problem accross multiple phones now. After a while, the notifications don't nest themselves together. Instead, it shows all my chats as separate notifications. When you're in as many chats as I am, it gets annoying to have your entire notifications bar filled with telegram. I've reached out to the support team about this and never received a response. So far, the only solution is to uninstall the app, and then reinstall, losing all settings.",0
"Everything is nearly perfect, except for a glaring privacy issue. Please give us an option to either disable contact sync entirely, or to disable the ""Who can find me through my number."" There's a large amount of people I know that flatout won't use Telegram because of it. This ""feature"" ends up outing many people to their family, co-workers, and friends a lot of the time. And I'm sure so many people would LOVE if we could disable it entirely.",0
"Thank you for your great app. Recently I've been having to deal with 2 problems. The first one is when there is no internet connection and I happen to see something that I want to save, I forward it to my saved massages and then when there is connection, sending fails and I lose the media I wanted. The second one is when I'm downloading some music files or media and it pauses it automatically.",0
"The app is good. But has some problem. The most annoying one is the voice call. No matter how good both of our connections are after 2-3 minutes it will show ""Reconnecting"" and I would hear some beeps. But it never reconnects. So I have to end the call and make it again and again after 2-3 mins. And another problem is ""last seen recently"". It's so annoying. Why can't you just show the exact time like other apps? Like "" last scene X minutes/hours ago"". I hope you will fix these bugs in future.",0
"The app is as good as a messaging app could get. Could say that it is the best one there is at the moment. But there's an issue that I makes me unable to use it, so what is the point of having it. I open the app and it works fine for, mostly, 5 seconds. Afterwards, it goes to a ""Conecting..."" status. If I close the app and Turn off and on my wifi in my phone, it works again for 5 seconds. For some reason it works better with mobile data but so many people have this problem.",0
"Undoubtedly the app is truly amazing. It has some great features including the movable sticker, emojis. But the main reason why I'm giving 2 star is actually my phone is based on Android 11 and the telegram bubble totally sucks. I don't have any clue how to disable this annoying bubble notification as Telegram app doesn't have any option to stop it. Can anyone help me? Thank you",0
"Noticed I don't get notifications until I open my phone or the app. Checked all the settings to make sure my notifications weren't muted and that's not the issue. seems to be a telegram connection issue. I have it set to run in background, but it still doesn't send me notifications sometimes. Update: It's somehow getting worse, 10 notifications just didn't come through until I opened the app. I think its because of the long ""Connecting"" issue and it's ruining the experience making it unusable",0
"I love the messaging portion of the app. It is fantastic and seemless across my devices and it is simple enough that my family and my girlfriend and I use it for messaging. Love the stickers and customization. My ONE complaint, which is especially important right now, is that the video chat is kind of clunky with PIP and it gets really slow. Also, the connection noise never plays at the call volume I have set, but instead at full blast. I really really find the video chat aspect very important.",0
"App is running pretty bad lately. Constant freezing and some crashing, slow to connect whether on wifi or data, just a bad experience as of late. Very frustrating at times. Know it's not net as other apps work fine. Phone has been rebooted more than once, not the phone. Have cleared cache multiple time and doesn't fix anything either. Used to run better before one of the last couple of updates. Update: Forgot to add it also locks my phone multiple times on occasion. It's incredibly infuriating.",0
"This app is nice to have for a private conversation, over a WiFi network, when you want to send a free text or phone call. Only problem is it doesn't work right all the time. It is hit-n'-miss as to whether it'll work. I'll wait all day with it cycling through saying ""connecting,"" before I have a minute or two that it works, and then back to ""connecting."" And yes, that's even after clearing out the cache and storage, etc. Over and over. I don't like to give poor ratings, but it's honest.",0
"Telegram has worked well for about 2 months, without issue. Sadly, 2 weeks ago it began the dreaded ""connecting..."" behavior. I had my wife check the app on her phone, and it wouldn't connect either. I've tried everything suggested out on the Internet including 2 complete uninstall/installs. The last uninstall was 2 days ago, and tried the install again this morning. Nothing causes it to connect and work properly. I only use mobile data - not having wi-fi access (which might work).",0
"The notification settings on this are absolutely terrible. I'll set it one way and it'll last for an hour, maaaaaaybe 2, before it resets to default. I tried completely silencing it and it's the same thing. If I didn't HAVE TO have this for work, I would uninstall and delete forever. It's especially disruptive while driving, which is my actual job. The actual app is fine but constantly having to reset the notifications and wasting my time is ridiculous.",0
"I have been using this app for a long time now. But 3 or 4 last updates were so bad. When someone calls me, app is not ringing at all and just sending me ""missed call"" notifications (sometimes I don't get them unless I open the app). And now I can't even return just missed calls, it shows ""waiting..."" and put it on a speaker. Developers have been adding a lot of useless things, plus they are not fixing bugs that they created, but making them worse. Work on it!!!!",0
"First, respect to Telegram for being supported by so many volunteers. And among the reasons it is not the platform I want to use, and I only have it for the three people who choose to use it exclusively, is it allows for contacts you long ago deleted from your phone. They aren't in the cloud anymore, and Telegram is constantly wired to your phone's history. This is ridiculous, possibly dangerous, and completely counter to what people need where their security is concerned.",0
"It used to work very well. All over sudden, the voice message stops working. Whenever I send someone a voice message, it doesn't go. I have good internet connection, I updated my phone, I tried different things, nothing worked. I use to think that it was better than whatsapp, but now I'm getting disappointed ☹️👎🏾👎🏾 PS: at first, I thought the problem was my phone, but some friends told me the same issue (when they send voice message, it doesn't go!!!)",0
"Been using telegram for a few years and the biggest issue that keeps this app from being nearly perfect is still unfixable. If you sign up with your real phone number, and your friend signs up to telegram and they have you in their phone contacts, it shows them your profile right off the bat. There is no chance to be able to separate your profile from anyone who just so happens to have your number in their contacts. Massive privacy issue, please remove this feature or add a feature to stop it.",0
"I don't know what's going on but for the last couple weeks I've been having some weird/annoying things happening. Gifs that get shared in groups I'm in are either not playing, zoomed in or part of the top and bottom get cut off when I click on them to full screen them. And then, I also had gifs that I sent suddenly get sent as photos. I don't have a update that's needed cuz I've checked. This is inconvenient/annoying. Please try and figure this out so I can enjoy the app thoroughly.",0
"One of the WORST notification systems of all times. Could be watching a video or typing when suddenly, Telegram's hot list of notifications covers the ENTIRE screen. Usually when typing and a tg notification appears, it shoves down the keyboard, eats a tap, then redirects you out of the place you were typing so you better PRAY that it's stored in a cache. Oh, and then it also counts the TG message as read with no ""mark unread"" feature, so you gotta deal with that too.",0
"This is about the lack of support. They changed the desktop interface for windows, so I can no longer change window size or control the frame. When I looked for advice, the only support is volunteers. I have asked in the volunteer channel for assistance and no one replies. There is no contact information. There is no way to solve technical issues.",0
"The information on this app is great however I cannot run telegram on my phone because when I do my phone's battery dies completely in an hour or two. It's a battery drainer!! I've never had problems with my battery before, only when I'm viewing telegram!! I thought my phone was dying, but as soon as I stopped using telegram phone worked fine. Also it randomly downloads info on your phone. Videos and documents Were found that I never wanted!! I found them in my phone files!!",0
"No way to import from Google messages. Even though it's on my phone, it doesn't find any of my contact, just does a 'global search' which I'm guessing finds other Telegram users, none of whom I know. I'd also installed the desktop version and had to use an uninstall tool to force removal because it would not uninstall otherwise. Not a good fit for me at this time. Too bad too, I thought it looked interesting.",0
"Notifications are a complete mess: There are multiple categories labeled as ""Default"" or ""In-App Default"" in each section. There are categories labeled ""Silent"" that nevertheless produce notifications. The category ""Internal Notifications"" refuses to be disabled. When I disable it, I'll soon get notifications from that category and find that it's enabled again. As a result, I have to completely disable notifications from the app, which mostly defeats the purpose of even having it installed.",0
"I truly love this app, but it's gone way downhill. It seems like every new update creates another problem. The swipe down for archive messages is glitched, the stickers are all out of whack (you tap one and it's actually something completely different), notifications are messed up if someone first reacts to a message and then sends a message... The list just keeps going and something new wrong with every update.",0
"Came from what's app and I wanted to try something new. The app feels good and fast, but it misses some great features for instance record video directly through the app, start message if I'm chatting with someone and they send me something important telegram doesn't have the option for me to star the msg and it can be saved in the app so I can have access to it easily and it doesn't have the option for the consumer to use wallpaper or add their own picture in the background etc",0
"This app was a go-to for group calls & chats. It's got a lot going for it & fun customization. However, the newest update really screwed with things. While I'm happy we can screenshare our screens on mobile (hopefully for pc as well), the audio quality worsens. The new icon placement is horrible as the camera feature is always turning on even when you're nowhere near it. The sound goes from speaker option to phone & flips constantly. I've had to set my volume on max just to have a conversation.",0
"Telegram should be able to use my contracts locally without syncing them to their cloud. I should not have to choose between privacy and basic functionality. I only use this app on Android and I have no interest in cross-platform sync. Telegram's private back end is also worrying from a security standpoint. The best way to verify that an app is truly secure is for it to be fully open source, but for Telegram only the front-end applications are open source. The lack of end-to-end encryption for all chats is another serious privacy risk. I should not have to join a ""secret chat"" with my friends in order for our conversation to be encrypted. Every chat should be end-to-end encrypted by default. Restoring chats on a new phone is not an essential feature and it's certainly not a strong enough reason to do without end-to-end encryption. Telegram should not repeatedly ask for SMS and call log permissions on startup either, and especially not just to save users from having to type a five-digit security code into a prompt. These permissions are extremely invasive and not worth granting for a one-time task this quick and easy. You should instead make all users type in their security codes. It honestly took me more taps to repeatedly deny your permission requests than it would have to just type the code in the first place, and it left a terrible taste in my mouth when installing the app. Do not send a notification to everyone with me in their contacts list when I join the app either. Everyone I know already knows how to contact me and this information does not need to be broadcast. Finally, notifications are extremely inconsistent. I see no reason why an app that's already using Google's push notifications should require a keep-alive service in order to have notifications work. The whole point of push notifications is that the app is supposed to be able to get woken up as needed to receive the notification. It should not have to be manually kept alive... If these issues were addressed, this would be a five-star app for me. It's certainly stylish and has a lot of good features. As is, it's just a privacy-focused app that doesn't respect users' privacy enough, a largely open-source app with an opaque back end, and a fully-featured app that somehow forgot the basics like battery-efficient, reliable notifications. I'd rather you do one main thing and do it exceptionally well, like Signal, than try to do three things halfway.",0
"I needed an app between friends with different phones for an upcoming wedding (couldn't use my preferred). This app is awful, it doesn't work on some wifi networks so I have to turn off wifi to communicate and then it takes forever for our messages to come through. Took forever to connect to even use, both phone and desktop (latter took literal days to ""connect"" and when it finally did, the link expired🙃). Plus limited reacts. Will delete after the wedding, this was horrendous.",0
I am having lots of connection issues with the app and it's becoming so often that I don't have the time to deal with this every single time when I need to text friends. I cleaned everything and I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I am still having problems. I know it's telegram because my other apps work just fine but not this app.,0
"To be honest, it has good options, but when you create a Telegram account, you can't find your friends' accounts in the list of contact numbers, even by searching, and whenever you want to listen to music from the music list, you have to download it again every time. This app is not safe, because in Iran they can easily find the number، which you created an account, even if your number is hidden, especially when you are a member of groups or channels. Of course, there are other problems .",0
"I love the app very well, but the past few hour I've not been able to login to my telegram account. It's always showing the same prompt ""too many attempts please try again later "". I left it for 9 whole hours and can't still login to my account. I feel like as if I am stuck outside the world please respond and help me to fix it. I really want to give it 5 stars but until this issue is resolved I can't seem to give it that rating.",0
"Everything works great except one!, while in group calls, Telegram doesn't allow to reroute the audio to a Bluetooth speaker, this is very frustrating,call on WhatsApp support this, even the regular phone app supports rerouting calls to a Bluetooth speaker, so why does a feature-packed messaging app like telegram not support this, I'm sure it's something doable, if WhatsApp can pull the string then so can you.",0
"Everything is fine except when I try to save to my device a media file (like videos) that I downloaded on telegram, it doesn't save the complete size of the file. For example, a 1GB file, if I save it to my device it will only download 2mb and the video won't be played. I hope there is a solution for this.",0
"I've been using telegram for many yrs. Never encountered any issues... But of recently, the settings keeps going back to silent even many times of re setting.. Or the messages only comes in when I wake the phone... Hv tried uninstall & install many times but issue still same. Pls do rectify this issue as it's really annoying.",0
"Great for messenger but calls need work. Cuts off alot and vid calls seems to drop frequently. The repetitive beeping when it tries to reconnect is very annoying. Also wish it wouldnt save all documents, vids, pics and audio files automatically. Takes up too much storage and requires clearing daily.",0
The secure chat just doesn't work properly. Messages that we think are sent on it doesn't get sent! It's stuck somewhere and the only thing the reciever gets is a secret message notification with no message when they click on it! Worse yet? This particular (ghost/pseudo) notification will keep repeating even after you've opened the notification once and with no messages delivered!!,0
"The last update is worst,because when I start to download the movies or files it says the file or movie doesn't exist ,Even it takes more time to download the content its been 7 days im still facing the issues ,Please fix the problems.When I searches someone it doesn't respond for it,or while searching for contacts it shows doesn't exist.",0
"I've been trying to report a scammer for an hour and cannot. I can easily report the ""Telegram tips"" conversation but not the actual scammer I'm talking to. There is no intuitive way to report. This has been beyond frustrating. Telegram is used by mostly scammers and people with hard drives you'd go to jail just for being in the same room. It's infuriating.",0
Their network connectivity is not good. Nothing is happening after installation no OTP received. And when u sent a chat to someone it doesn't work. It shows secret message in top but after clicking nothing is visible. Please check this. Worst app!,0
"This app used to be the best, now its just the worst. Always asking for payment for everything. Either you pay or use an ugly looking app .The default ui is bad. You can't stop stories from popping up on the top makes it just ugly . Now days customization and big file shearing is the only thing telegram is good for Wait not even customization most of the important customization is paid. it's not a handy app for texting at all, it's just junky and looks ugly with so much feature, fix it please!",0
"This was once one of the best apps for privacy. Now, I must pay just to ensure scammers cannot contact me. A basic feature in almost every social networking platform. Shame Telegram, because even the ads you push in groups are also from financial scam channels.",0
"Had to turn off notifications because the specific settings I keep putting on them keep changing themselves. And did so many times over the day, despite having set them specifically how I wanted...",0
"This app works great on my other devices except for my main phone. I don't know if others have this same issue here but scrolling is a headache. On other apps, scrolling doesn't create problems but with Telegram scrolling leads to reacting to messages, opening chats, opening videos and down right rejecting gestures entirely. I always have to lock and unlock my phone before I gain functionality albeit temporarily.",0
"Slow. Just so slow. Not sure if Telegram throttles Andorid because my friends who use iPhone the uploading of videos, the telescope ones are never this slow. I've tried VPN, no VPN, clean cache and it's just always the same. I really enjoy telegram I do but it's just so awful for video sharing.",0
"been consistently using this app to message for years and in the last month there's been an issue with notifications/how i receive messages. sometimes i won't know if someone messaged me unless i go and check the chat directly, sometimes i need to just open the app, sometimes i have to SEND a message to them, it rarely works normal now, and it's disappointing.",0
"Downloads gets stuck, landscape monde glitches. Everytime I get a video on full screemode, the chat goes to the last message on the conversation and I lost track of where o was. Also there is a problem with downloads since a while ago. There is space in my device, good internet connection and the videos downloads in a tortoise speed.",0
"I have been trying to log into my telegram account for two days now and it'll show an intetnal error occured and your team will say an sms will be sent to my number but no sms will be sent and the telegram will be like cant send sms pls try to fix the issue asap. Apart from this,the app is 5 star. Its really frustrating so pls tend to it asap",0
"For texting it's fine. But for the past 3 YEARS, I have had constant issues with calling. Whether it's lag on the other side, them not hearing me at all, the constant issue where it I call someone, it gets stuck on ""waiting"" and the call never goes through and then it says ""line busy"" when the person IS NOT BUSY! IT'S THE SAME ISSUE FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS! HOW HAS THE CALLING NOT BEEN FIXED?! TELEGRAM. FIX YOUR CALLING. PLEASE. IT'S HORRENDOUS!",0
"Earlier the application doesn't use to consume much of my device's battery life... but now it drains the battery out of the device very often, and also heats up the device. Please check to it.",0
"2 stars just to attract attention to the issue: I’ve had this problem for a long time: when there is an incoming call, I hear the ringtone, but I don’t see the incoming call on the screen. It’s not clear who’s calling, it’s not clear how to answer the call. There is nothing on screen about call, but there is rington, which only confusing. After the end of the call I see notification that there was a missed call, but I could not answer it because absolutely nothing was offered on the screen.",0
"I've been using the application for 2 years now and I loved it until I discovered that random people can text you here. On reporting, Telegram doesn't even respond. I've always thrived to report and ban all the bad-doers on the group, texting girls etc. but if Telegram themselves don't look into it. I don't think it's a good app if you highly regard your internet safety.",0
"I made a channel and everytime I made a hash tag things, some of the message that had hashtag on it, didn't get detect at all. I kinda confused and it's happened yesterday as well. So many bugs and lag. And even worse, my profile chat supposed to has 1 picture. But it's somehow had more than one! I just hope it will get fix. Mostly the discussion group chat. Because it's getting annoying when the picture have more than 1 even I already delete the previous picture",0
Moving previously free features behind a paywall leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Losing a lot of goodwill here. Otherwise it's more or less functional minus constant connection issues.,0
The stories is the worst feature that was added to telegram ever. The way how it was added and place in the screen are so annoying that I have to change my rate from 5 to 2. Hope telegram will return to the simplicity and beauty of the interface as soon as possible.,0
I downloaded telegram in 2017. It was working all fine till the last update in which they added subscription on downloading speed. And now it is very slow to download a single file from telegram it feels like i am sharing a file through bluetooth just like in late 2015s. I THINK SPEED IS THE MAJOR FACTOR FOR TELEGRAM TO BE IN THE RACE OF TECH ERA.,0
"It was going very well but the last few months it got worse, the media that I download often disappears even though I don't delete it, I've also updated my Telegram to the latest version and my storage still have enough space. But some media kept disappearing even after I downloaded them several times. Please fix this!",0
I uninstalled this app because the messages were not being delivered. I installed it again with the same number but now it is not getting verified. It is showing under process. I reinstalled it 3 times but I'm facing the same issue again and again.,0
"I don't know whether it is a ploy to kick out the free users or what. I will see a pop notification but once I enter Telegram am not seeing the message being displayed in the notification bar. It takes forever to update, sometimes I have to exit time and again and enter again so as to refresh. Please check on that.",0
The apps automatically updates a group to supergroup and it's very hard to manage them... this should not be happening and if so we should have the option to manage and convert these supergroups back to normal. very inconvenient user interface.,0
"Rest is nice and I appreciate, but need a lot improvement in voice calls and video calls. Barely call gets connected even with good internet speed, and with low speed don't even think of it.",0
App is ok but there is most irritating issue which is If I start any bot I can't stop it. There is not an option to stop bot sending me messages. All I can do is delete chat and block it. And I don't want to see bot in by block list. I just want to request telegram team to update app and add features to stop bot sending messages.,0
There is a lot of problem when downloading any file or video it just wastes my data and the file will not be downloaded. It gets struck in the middle itself causing a lot of problem,0
"would be an OK app to use if not all the idiotic channels you've being added to constantly without your permission, and inability to choose the multiple channelsro delete at the same time... it's just too much spam, too much SPAM!!",0
TELEGRAM is a gud application for messaging and sharing videos links etc. but I don't why I'm having server issue or what because when I try to download any media the data speed goes slow suddenly even though I couldn't watch story because of there server problem... Please try to fix this issue as soon as possible otherwise I'll uninstall telegram forever.,0
"Forced Telegram stories ruined my experience. You just can't hide them. Devs or whoever thought that it would be a great idea, IT IS NOT. I'm switching to the Telegram X. Hopefully it would be without that bullsh*t. Edit: (answer) yes you can hide stories from regular users, but you can't do it with official Telegram ones. I constantly had 1 story that takes space. You aren't able to archive Telegram chat, I accepted that, but this issue was the last drop.",0
"Generally a great messenger app, but each update brings a ton of new bugs. Front camera recordings no longer work at all, some of my chats refuse to display media past the leap day, sometimes Telegram freezes for literally 1 hour because I sent a gif (and continues to freeze if I restart, as it tries re-sending the gif)..",0
"Много лагает, также очень бесит когда хочешь убавить/прибавить музыку, то включается видео сообщение, это мешает жутко. It lags a lot, it's also very annoying when you want to turn down / add music, then a video message turns on, it gets in the way terribly.",0
Plz fix the proxy settings as it disconnect from the proxy server after some time when i finish and go back from the app the proxy cannot run in the background with vpn app it works perfect but cannot run inthe back ground with using telegram proxy settings. plz fix this issue and have my 5star as your rating. Waiting for the update 🙂🙂,0
It is an awesome app. All perfect application one need for entertainment and education. But the stuffs I download delete itself. My notes and videos are deleted and I am sick of it. Please solve this issue.,0

"Hi all,  I would like to bring to your attention that sometimes apps start blinking and asking for microphone access continuously even when I'm not using the voicemail or phone call. and some annonimus activity. Kindly check and fix the issue ASAP.",0
Please help telegram is not functioning properly it's very difficult to download voice note and messages and it's not that I don't have Data. it's extremely slow to load. My other friends to a complaining the same thing. Please work on this very fast. Because telegram is a very good app,0
"Its such a great chating aap, but theres a major problem with internet connections. Telegram doesnt work without the help of any VPN. Everytime have to on VPN, thats just so irritating. ill really appreciate if u focus on ur connections instead of just focusing on our privacy teams, Thanks you.",0
"Well, it's a source of news. Lots of info typically not allowed on FB and anywhere else can be found here, both useful and harmful. I used to post truth on ruzzian z-channels (no bad words, just truth). Those, apparently, reported that as spam. Now I'm banned from writing. Even premium subscription doesn't cancel that. It's the sweet spot now: tg for content, more secure messengers for messaging ))",0
"Bugs! Everytime I clear in-app cache or app info> clear cache I need to re-update the app, and stop forcing us to download those duck stickers, without permission by default. please FIX the above ASAP Otherwise, great cloud syncing n file sharing system.",0
"Automatically syncs with your phone's contacts, so if someone else in your contacts list has telegram, then they'll get notified of your new telegram account. Kind of stupid for an app purpose built on privacy.",0
"I hate this app. It opens by itself, blocks other apps I'm using and is overall irritating. I didn't want to be visible and even though I made the change in the settings it still shows me. I only gave it 2 stars for its functionality. I do not recommend this app at all.",0
Secret chat is not working properly. Telegram just giving option but it's not work properly. Even not can not open telegram. Worst app for privacy reasons because all other data in normal chat is saved on server which may be encrypted by operator any time.,0
"Until now, Telegram has been the best application that I have used, but for some time now, it has found an annoying bug that cannot be solved with every update, so that the chat and channels are not loaded, and you have to close the telegram completely every time. and open again to load. This bug is very annoying and time consuming. please consider it.",0
"There is pretty annoying bug: When I start warching a video in some channel and rotate phone horizontally. When video ends I rotate the phone and hit back. And the position in channel is lost. I have to search that message to return reading next. P.S. I downgraded rating because this issue driving me crazy. Searching position after every video is a waste of time! PS. Downgraded again, to 2 stars now as the issue is not being addressed.",0
"I'm mokay, but I'm just disappointed because I thought sending videos or even chats here would be fast, but it's not. Even if I can go online on Messenger or other applications quickly, this app is still connecting!!

Screen share with audio not available. Downloading speed is too low. Group video stream is not encrypted. It should be more fast and stable.,0
I am a premium user for unlimited download speed... But even after upgrading my download speed is not more than 900KBPS... I am also checking my connection speed which is jio 5G it is showing downloading speed of 30MBPS but my telegram downloads are very slow even after subscribing to premium.. I have paid for having unlimited download speed and I am not getting it.. even after my connection is very good 5G network,0
"App is nice but it should be having the features for keeping ""status"" !! Sharing ""stories""....and can't it be available for ordinary users also .......not only for the premium users 😅😅😅 (it's my opinion) hope you will consider and have status option also for everyone",0
"This is now my sole messaging app because it is brilliant. However the last couple of updates has spoiled one of the best features of the app. About about every emoji I tap on now, it fails to show up the relevant stickers so I have to individually search for them. Stickers just fail to show up when most emojis are chosen. Such a basic thing not working properly is frustrating. Please fix it. Until then, I'd give this app a 2, cause this one flaw puts a serious dent into the whole app experience",0
"Update: some odd things happening on telegram. Same as just below's update. Very frustrating Update: some messages still missing from channels. Sometimes channels aren't updating at all or stop. Telegram not playing videos? Yesterday all was fine, last night I started getting a message which says ""Can't play video. Video codec not supported."" PLEASE change so I can watch videos again. Thanks! Older: I'm not receiving my messages, sometimes ever. Please check what is going on. Thanks.",0
"This application is broken after updating. I've been using it for 7 years now, but I guess it's time to quit. I can't play a video that is still downloading. And when I let the video complete downloading, I can't play it because somehow, it's downloading again for me to be able to play it. Why? Just why? When I look at other reviews, since this Christmas update, almost everyone is complaining about video play issues. Fix it",0
"To get Teligram premium service is toughest process . They wants email password which is very private information. No one would like to share their email id password with you.

"The recent Telegram update poses significant accessibility challenges for screen reader users. There's a lack of feedback on voice note and attachment downloads, leaving users uncertain. The voice note recording interface has become inaccessible, with missing edit boxes and record buttons. Urging developers to prioritize these issues for a more inclusive user experience.",0
I m still facing problem after checking from network provider.... his phone facing the same issue while installing n proceedings with telegram..... Worsen experience with this app.. it is not failing to calls every single time..show me offline even I'm online...install it again in phone but not operating properly.... Receive msgs on n off ..when trying to read they continually connecting but not updating.... I install this app in 3 phones but not working properly,0
"Lately, all the updates are focused on premium features and it's forgetting the vast majority of its users. When accessing emojis, I loved to be able to slide left/right for their categories and it's changed to side slide for emoji/gifs/stickers, making it slower to use it. Normal emojis are also being invaded by paid ones and it's impossible to disable. Why is there this endless row of locked stuff? I feel the paid features are being shoved down my throat. It's very uncomfortable to use.",0

"To be honest, it has good options, but when you create a Telegram account, you can't find your friends' accounts in the list of contact numbers, even by searching, and whenever you want to listen to music from the music list, you have to download it again every time. This app is not safe, because in Iran they can easily find the number، which you created an account, even if your number is hidden, especially when you are a member of groups or channels. Of course, there are other problems .",0

I am a premium user for unlimited download speed... But even after upgrading my download speed is not more than 900KBPS...

Everything's good about this app but sending a message it takes too long for a message to take and send if you could fix the sending a message and how long it takes to get from one place to the next where a conversation could be more enjoyable instead of waiting for day sometime before your message gets to the sender that you're sending it to doesn't have to be incredible but until that gets fixed this app is just okay I wouldn't recommend it to anybody to talk on right now,1
"In the latest version there is an issue with built-in video player. The time navigation inside video player doesn't work. Every time I double tap left or right to navigate backward or forward, it starts the video from the beginning. Sliding the navigation bar for custom time-seeking also doesn't work. Looking forward for a fix with this pesky bug. Thanks.",1
"Thanks for your response about hiding stories. 1. Even though it doesn't take up more space in the UI, the fact that it's visible means that it takes up space in my consciousness, which is annoying. 2. Telegram's story is the only story that shows up. I already tried to hide it before your reply, but all it does is make my phone vibrate twice and does nothing. Hiding it from the story's menu is a Premium feature. I don't want to pay to hide something that I didn't need/want.",1
"It is a great app and I depend so much on it in my studies, but in the last updates why did you remove offline access to the row (media, files, music..) which appears in the chats, channels and groups. Now when I am in a place without network, I can't get the files I want easily. Please reconsider your decision and bring it back.",1
"Almost perfect. I would love settings to be able to change notifications for specific chats. I have multiple chats in the same group, but I don't care about ALL of them. Make it the settings more diffrentiable for each chat. I would love better notifications when I'm @ed. The notifications aren't there if I don't actually click in the app. I'd like to be alerted better when I get tagged.",1
"For the free version, this app is amazing! But I paid for premium for extra customization features and every single day I have to adjust the theme settings as they reset themselves back. What's the point then? And if you pay for premium, why not give the option to pin up to 15 or 20 chats? Not just 5 more. Update: I now have to adjust the theme settings several times a day back to my preferred colors. Very annoying.",1
"Since I have received the new update, the volume of music and voices has decreased several times, and to hear the voices, I have to put the main speaker of the phone to my ear to hear the voices, my phone model is Poco F4 GT. Please fix this problem because it is very annoying, also I can't delete and install the app because I have downloaded almost 60 GB of files from Telegram and by uninstalling the app, all my data is deleted. Thank you for always fixing the bugs",1
"It's been a long time that I'm waiting for the version of telegram that allows us to make more than 10 folders for our channels. Another thing that I really want to be fixed is searching. When I search for something that I've saved through my saved massages, telegram doesn't show my object. it does exist in saved massages but telegram doesn't switch to the massage. And it's a stupid restriction that we can't have more than 500 channels.",1
"I love being able to customize my entire chats, my biggest gripe is the video call feature. There used to be an auto rotate when you move your phone around so the person on the other end could always see you upright. Now when I hold my phone sideways or use the back camera I need to rotate my entire phone around so the person on the other end of the call can see what I showing them. Please bring back the auto rotate thanks",1
"Love the app but the customization has become worse and worse over the years. It's so confusing and glitchy and really needs to be streamlined to be more clear, straightforward, and functional. In addition, the sounds for reconnecting and ending calls are very loud and obnoxious. Please add an option to disable/change those sounds. Please also add an option to remove the pop-up when low power mode turns on.",1
"Tg used to be so great until they started adding so many features that so many users don't even like *and* lost touch with reliability. every version has annoying bugs. 😥 and to make matters worse, they hide their bug reporting system. Tg seriously lacks on communicating w/ users. and now seriously lacks on reliability. Sadly, IMHO, Tg is only mediocre now when it used to be 5 star. it used to not have ads. now the ads for 'Premium' are beyond frustrating. very frustrating. 😡",1
"Interesting. Im not in a job or anything that requires this for personal safety. Either way I am grateful to the creators of telegram for the incalculable service to humanity that this must provide from what I've seen. I don't want the 3 start review to distract from that, I merely see some improvements to be made. For instance in storage settings there's two options: /storage/emulated And /Storage/bunch-a-numbers Is that supposed to read device vs. SD storage? Could we have that option? TY.",1
"The main window erroneously shows unread messages in archived groups. When viewing archived chats there is no indication which group(s) triggered the new message icon. Knowing which group most likely trigger the new messages icon I scrolled to the end of those mesaages. Despite numerous attempts to clear new message icon, it persists. At best, the number is reduced by one. Only closing the app works. Even then, the issue returns. The benefits of archiving is lost until this issue is resolved.",1
"This app is great for communicating with people that is more secure than text messaging. Even though most people don't need any extra security, like me, there is no downside to having it. There are definitely some improvements to be made, my experience on Android is different than my friends with iPhones. They have the ability to take screenshot of secure chats but I cannot. Same app should have same capabilities regardless. I do like the higher quality videos and images, better than text msg",1
"App is great for chatting but has some ridiculous issues. You have to tap a gear icon everytime you upload a video or else it automatically drops the quality to about 140p while keeping the file size, just make it the original quality by default. Worst notification system of any app I've ever experienced. Even if you set it to never repeat notifications once you already have them, it'll proceed to send multiple notifications from the chat. Just make it send one if you already have a notification",1
"The new gallery is terrible, it genuinely prevents me from sending stuff sometimes. There doesn't need to a stupidly slow animation for clicking the drop down menu. You've also severely lowered usability by removing the visual component of looking at albums with their thumbnails. I like this app a lot but it's stuff like that that keeps me using discord",1
"I genuinely like this app, however when it comes to initiating outgoing messages through Android Auto or through Google Assistant it simply does not work. Google Assistant responds with ""Sorry, I can't send messages with Telegram yet."" In the past, this function did work. I understand many other users have noticed this specific issue. Would love to see an update that fixes this issue in the near future.",1
"Telegram usually works really well for me, but for the past few months and especially the past 2 days, both my husband and I cannot connect to it if we're not on our home Wifi. The minute we leave our home and go onto Tmobile data it will not connect. The oddest part is, we receive notifications of new messages in our drop-down notification bar,but when we open the app it says ""Connecting..."" and will not display any new messages. It will say Connecting until I'm back on my home Wifi. Please fix",1
"The app used to be great! But the newest update has been really buggy. I don't get notified when I get new messages anymore. I've checked all the settings on both the app and my phone. I still don't know I have anything until I open the app and check. Also, now when I go the home screen on the app, the new messages are HIDDEN at the top of the screen. I have to pull down to see them. The voice to text option doesnt work anymore either. Might need to switch to a new messenger app.",1
"Very frustrating how it regularly loses connection. Multiple times a day, the app gets stuck ""connecting..."", but it never connects. This isn't a data problem (closing/reopening the app fixes it). This is especially frustrating when I'm already in a conversation and wondering why the recipient isn't responding anymore (to find out it's my app not sending or receiving anything, again...)",1
"I stopped getting push notifications several months ago. I've checked my settings both in app and in my phone. My friends I chat with say the same thing happens to them too. It isn't uncommon for me to think no one has messaged in days then open the app and get bombarded with old unread messages. Of course, often at that point a push notification shows up, which is not very helpful at that point.",1
"frankly bizarre UI options. for example to save a gif, you must first select a message, tap save to GIFs, which does not save the gif, but rather it is added to a favorites list. then you must send a message with that gif from the list, now select your sent message, and press download, which will then save the file to your downloads folder. which just seems bizarre to me. often unresponsive and takes multiple presses to open a chat.",1
All in all Telegram is a fast and seemingly secure messaging service that I've been happy to use. My only gripe with it is that there seems to be a bug that does not allow me to customize my chat settings. I set a theme of my liking and it is in use for about 30 seconds before reverting to the standard Telegram monotonous blue. Fast forward another 30 seconds and it reverts to the theme I set. Then another 30 seconds and we're in a nonstop battle of blue vs green (the color scheme I chose),1
"Latest update forced gradients, transparencies and effects into chats and text bubbles, making the interface look awful. Plus, changing the theme to a combination of plain colors with no transparency or gradients is harder than ever before. Customization is a big part of the experience with apps like this, and now it feels like you need to build your own theme or download one from the internet for you to have more classic experience. Please give us more plain customization options.",1
"I HATE that it downloads every photo and video. It ruins my phone. Yes, you can go in to adjust settings, but then nothing streams. Updste won't install because it has filled my phone to the point of being useless. I must spend hours on backup to delete hidden files. We all assume it's safe. Hope that's true, but TRUST NOTHING.",1
"Reduced Quality I dont know what happened to your app, but since the last 2 updates it takes forever for telegram to connect and send anything. Text or any kind of media. It just keeps saying ""connecting....."" for too long. Its getting to the point where I'm just going to shitcan this app for Signal or some other messaging app. Even with 1 or 2 bars out of 5 it would still send. Now with full bars it takes too long.",1
"Hello... I send more than 100 images and several audio files to my channel daily. I need these files to be sent in the order I selected and sorted, for example, from the oldest to the newest. But sometimes they are sent back and forth. This problem can easily be solved by putting a delay between the transmissions, but it doesn't exist! Please fix it so that Telegram remains the best",1
"Good for communicating with isolationist iPhone from an Android. But have to dock a couple stars bc of a recent issue. If I have open in desktop browser, & type draft on phone while away from comp, it's populated in the browser text box too. If I delete the text on my phone it doesn't get deleted on the desktop & keeps filling in my phone text input with that text! Over & over! The draft reappears seconds after I delete! Over & over! Until I get back to my comp & delete in my browser! Fix plz!!!",1
The app on all clients will refuse to load the full list of channel and group subscribers/members past a certain point and will refuse to show members/subs when searching for them manually despite them being in the group/channel. The app also still crashes for regular users when attempting to access any files that are over 2GB in size. Fix your issues instead of throwing out more new features that keep breaking the app more. It's slowly starting to become unusable.,1
"Things have suddenly become weird with telegram. I will be able to record a voice message one day, or to one person, then the next day it doesn't work. It won't even allow me to record, despite letting me do it 2 hours ago with the same person... While the app is set to English, it's telling me things in other languages... And not languages that I understand. I will uninstall and reinstall, but that's a pain too, and it's not what anyone should have to do with a messaging app just to use it.",1
"I enjoy this app and its features, specifically the animated emojis! What needs to be looked into is the audio when listening to voicenotes. The playback sounds as if the pitch is on high speed, which makes it difficult to understand what is being said. The calls needs to be improved when I'm speaking internationally. Local calls, so far are okay. Work on those two aspects and WhatsApp would be put out of business!",1
"Used to work just fine, now all time drops connections on mobile data and 200mb/s broadband wifi connection, several time says ""connecting"" when a call starts, already tried with different users, also on Bluetooth it switch output sources, when I choose Bluetooth to get it back doesn't work, I tried with beats studio 3 wireless and airpods, also tried on 3 different devices and still have the same issue, this is the only app where the Bluetooth fails. Would be great if could be fixed",1
"It's a very good messaging app, promptly fixed bugs, overall would highly recommend this app. Edit #3: It used to fix bugs promptly. Currently have a bug with sharing images function or copy pasting them into a chat from my phone. They show up in Google Photos app even when the options in Telegram's settings is turned off to save to gallery once the phone is restarted. So do the settings default ""on"" during boot and turn off right after perhaps? Based on folder name feel is Tele over Photo/Brave",1
"Update, 12/21. The video calls are increasingly sluggish or just don't connect. ... Mostly happy with the app. Deleted WhatsApp and installed it and never regretted it. In the contacts list in the App, when you block someone, there should be some clear way to see that you've blocked that contact already. Instead, it requires clicking on the contact, then the three dots, and then see it. The notifications for new message are hit or miss. Rest is good. Love animated emojis!",1
"I generally like using this for messaging; however, I'm very annoyed by the fact that almost every time I reopen the app after not using it for a while, the chat settings have reset to the default. I constantly have to go back into chat settings to get the background and colors the way I want. If this stopped happening, I wouldn't have any complaints.",1
"Works most of the time. I really like the video message feature. Sometimes it won't properly send notifications. Now having issues with the widget when used with Samsung's new Smart Widgets. The widget will randomly change irs height from 1-tile to 2-tiles, cutting off half the widget. Only fix I've found is to delete and re-add the widget. Just a mild annoyance.",1
"I can't see the pop up for incoming calls now, video calls and regular calls are not the best quality. I can't multi video call, I can't multi conference call unless it's on an established group, GIF sometimes crash the app... That's among some. Sharing is very easy and there are some cool tricks and features that are appreciated. The fact that you can use a user name and not your number to communicate with other people is a plus",1
"Great app, only problem is when I personalize the notifications for this app if automatically changes itself to pop up on my screen interfering me, changes the ringtone, and turns on sound when I mute it. I reached out to the ""voluntary customer service"" last week and still no response although I get it since they disclose they dont pay for representatives but this is a tech problem. In all, I have to keep the notifications off and check in every so often to see if I have anyone has contact me",1
"Telegram is great in everything. It's features are very useful. But it takes eternity to upload or send files. Even for a photo , it's takes a minute. I have tried to upload with different wifi connections still it makes no difference , it's clearly not the network's fault. I hope the telegram team will look into into this matter and resolve this issue in the upcoming days.",1
"The audio function of this app needs serious work and updates. There is a consistent and nagging drop in calls even when Wi-Fi is fully functional. The audio quality is horrible during calls. When you record voice notes, it automatically comes with background noises. No noise cancellation. Otherwise, it has some beautiful functions.",1
"The camera does not work in Telegram on iPad. I tried to write to support several times, but a lot of time passed and I never received an answer. The circle simply blurs and does not record video. Previously, this problem also occurred, but it could be eliminated by restarting the device, clearing the memory, or reinstalling the app. I can't do anything now. There is no such problem on other devices. It's very sad because I've been using telegram for many years and I really liked this app..",1
"Why have you changed the settings to the old form where you have to search through to see the messages you've gotten. The demarcations of the personal messages, unread messages and the All in one messages were very helpful and good and also convenient too. Telegram is the best app so far buh please go back to the previous update and update on other things the demarcations please 🥺😪",1
"Overall, I love the app. However, when a new feature is activated (eg. activating topics to your group, or ownership of the group being passed to another admin), the group is ""upgraded to supergroup"", which would be fine, if this didn't mean losing all your history (shared media, pinned messages). Basically, you're opening a new group which doesn't have direct access to the old one, where everything is stored. Would be 5🌟 if this could be fixed, it's kind of frustrating",1
"For years im using Telegram and always satisfied with it ( incl. Support) but for months now nothing then issues who come with almost daily updates. Edit: The updates are not making the app better, it was a great product but on all things comes an end. Telegram lost the part where they started with in the beginning. They went over the top and losing grip. With pain I uninstall it and will continue with Threema and Signal only. Thank you for the great years of providing service.",1
"I don't know why but right now my texts are taking longer time to get delivered, I'm unable to open any group or old texts because they are not loaded,i checked my internet connection there's no issue with internet connectivity. Other apps are working fine . Please do check this issue and resolve it as soon as possible. Otherwise the app is really awesome except for the few lags like after downloading the complete in last few mbs it automatically sets to 0 or it stops mid way .",1
"It's a great service still, but degrades regularly. Now we've got a premium tags feature and LOST an option to add reactions to the saved posts. Download hangs could be that trend too. It's not anymore a set of ""forever free"" features plus some advanced prepaid features, it's a ""pay or regret"". And a lot of old UX issues: * Video autoreplay. * Unable to set last-read position (it resets occasionally too often). * Too much non-disableable baby fun (emojee, stickers, avatar animations etc)...",1
"No sms code comes to register the phone number. --- Update one day later... So, it still sends the code, but due to bug in the app you must reinstall it first of all, then swipe left all starting guide screens on start, and only then press Start button. This workaround does the job. I up the stars but only to 3, as apart of sms problem, it works unstable recently, crashes sometimes and asks to download/install updates too often (once per 1-2 week) which though doesn't fix its existing problems.",1
"It's blazing fast and awesome. However, it lacks a lot of control over contact sync. It's too simple and sometimes contacts get added with no reason? I keep deleting them but even with contact sync disabled they still appear. That needs to be fixed. Also, it's not the ""private"" solution for messages anymore.",1
"WHY isn't end-to-end-encryption turned on by default? Starting 'secret chats' feels so weird, like you have to explain to your friends what you're doing. I won't turn it on just because of the 'having to explain' part. At the very least, call it something else, or make it possible in the same chat window, mentioning that the chats from NOW will be encrypted. Turn the encryption on by default, or give us an option to turn it on for all of the messages. 'Secret Chats' is just weird.",1
"I'm not able to permanently disable the stories feature, not just hide it, should have an option to disable it, not everyone likes this; in the chat, where I type, when I want to find an emoticon by the name, it doesn't recognize the english language, I have to look for it manually; when I slide my left thumb over the screen, it starts audio-recording and blocks the screen, I have to unblock the screen and delete the undesire recorded audio. Why so many flaws? you weren't like this. 🤔",1
"Best messenger, absolutely. Used it for many years. Chat, sync, themes, etc. all of them are near perfect. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is the import chat feature is NON-EXISTENT. Near the end of 2023 I accidently deleted one of my favorite contact's chat and I cannot find a way to get it back. I have an export of about 2/3 chat content in a html format. How. Do. I. IMPORT? We had 3k+ photos and media files, thosands of messages, etc. Really would mean to me to find a way to get this back.",1
"I have the utmost respect for the telegram app, especially with the TON blockchain integration. I am fully invested in the app and the TON eco system, but it is so frustrating that for 2 years my account have been spam blocked for no reason and despite several appeals no feedback from the telegram team. Please can I at least get a feedback and my appeal considered? I don't spam neither do I text strangers. And with the future of TON, telegram is integral. Please respond to my complaint. Thanks.",1
"I logged out from Telegram unexpectedly and wasn't able to log in after that. It keeps showing 'sorry too many attempts. Please try again later'. It's been almost 24 hours, and i still fail to log in. PLEASE DO LET ME KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED SIMILAR ISSUE AS THIS. Would really appreciate your feedback on this.",1
"hey team telegram, from today morning i'm facing some problem with connecting. I use my wifi always while using the app and i've tried connecting with another network and it worked but my wifi is all good, all other apps are running good and so smoothly and if i connect vpn then the connecting thing doesn't show anymore. I want your help. I love using this app and i'm using it for 1 year and i just only chat and talk with friends on call please look into this matter Thanks.",1
"Greetings. Dear team, Despite the best performance from your app, I regret to say that the current version of Telegram (10.10.0) on my phone (Galaxy A7 2017) is crushing very time and the responds (""Telegram has Stopped""). I have tried opening it offline or in airplane mode as well, the same problem occurred then as well. Kindly let you know if there is anything to be done to fix it. Best Dost",1

"My Telegram app was working fine but upload speed was very slow for two or three days for a long time. If you upload any video, it takes minimum twenty to thirty minutes to reach someone.My request to Telegram is to try to fix the problem I am facing as soon as possible because it is causing me a lot of problems and losing a lot of money.",1
The app was working fine with no issues since the latest update with the sticker creation I cant set anymore the chat with my husband as Priority so that also the chat bubble opens up. It also removes the custom notifications i always set.,1
The app is great. but l struggle when I download music it does not want to automatically save them to my phone . each time after download l have to go back and start save one by one .. it's quite boring. please advise if there is a way,1
"Good but u are enhancing and focusing more on only PREMIUM FEATURES. So according to my observation, some people can't buy Premium. I could ask you for enhancing free features sometimes. And PERSONALLLY I ASK YOU FOR ADDING ""CAPTION"" (SUBTITLE) FUNCTION TO THE TELEGRAM. and it would be better if you add that to telegram for all of the Telegram users (preium, not preium)",1
"Really enjoying the app. One BIG issue for me is that notifications show the number of unread messages, whereas in the app itself there are no new messages showing. Very confusing",1
"Great app but unfortunately i have been encountering problems such as (1) my calls won't come thru to the other party, (2) outgoing calls kept on ringing but the other party's phone does not ring at all, and (3) my calls kept on getting canceled. Hope this gets fix soon.",1
"It's a good app to chat with friends. I will rate it 5 stars, but there is something I don't like when I want to delete a message it always deletes me, not for my friends. I had to press a button, and then it deletes for my friend. This is the reason I rated 3 star plz fix this to automatically delete for everyone",1
"It's a really good aap with lot of eye catching features, I hv been using it for a quite long time, for past some time it shows connecting all the time, it shows notifications of new msgs, but when you click the notification to open the chat doesn't show new msgs, shows connecting. While with VPN it connects. One out of thousand times it works well too without VPN for some time.other social media chats working normal. Kindly help me in this regard !!!",1
"""Everyone"" uses it. Absolutely has a thing going for it. But the constant nagging to go ""premium""... I know, running a messaging infrastructure isn't cheap... and it's a delicate balance between what users want and being in the user's face. Will still be around, but it's a delicate situation...",1
"Everytime I receive a call, I can't pick up. No notification show in my notifications menu. My phone just keeps ringing without an end. I have to restart my phone to get it to stop. I checked my notification settings and all are turned on. I even have run app in background turned on.",1
"I don't understand why audio files plays automatically from newer to older. A bug or an editor's choice ? Voice messages plays in the right order older to newer. Using Android, tested on 2 galaxy s phones.",1
"Great app. But, a some bugs are being founded. When downloading a file, it is too much slow. I think in future, telegram will lose their power in downloading files.",1
"This app is so cool. Apart from it being a texting app and having cool stickers I am able to join some groups and download my favourite anime. I recommend it for everyone ...but I would've given it 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that some files I download automatically don't open or download process starts all over again, some files are not even accessible. Pls fix it",1
"This is a good app with speed and accuracy.But I liked the old saved messages,where we can find where we took that files or videos. But in this updated feature has no thing like that. I hope you will turn it back like the old saved message on the next update. Thank you.",1
"I used to love this app. But something happened that changed my mind. All of a sudden my app closed and opened and allll the chat, channels, groups everything was gone as if it is the 1st time I am using it!! The whole cloud disappeared and all my messages also disappeared from my contacts' chats and they thought I have done it! Worse than that after months of trying to get support from telegram through the form they provided, support bot, etc., nooooo reply so far! Soooo disappointing 😔😔",1
"User friendly! Telegram is a very good app. What I like most is the frequent update. I need to understand how files and download works on your application. A few days after downloading loads of video courses from my coach, every single file was no longer accessible. I had to download again. As if that wasn't enough. The same thing occurred again. Is this how the app has been designed to handle downloads?",1
My account automatically gets Logged out for 5 times in a row in every week and I don't know . I am not satisfied with the new updated version. Its getting worse . I keep every important chat in my search but after logging out it gets cleared and I am so my pissed. Then my email couldn't even got code verification after 5 times and that's the problem,1
"The app was working smoothly since last few years but now it is just not getting logged in and due to it I am missing out on my work, after entering the mobile no., the screen is just showing the loading circle and even after waiting for couple of minutes, it's on the same screen. It is getting logged in on other devices, only my device is facing the issue. Pls resolve",1
"Update: For the love of God add SMS support. Nobody can make this a primary messaging app without this feature. Also let me schedule blocks of time each day I wish to receive (or not receive) notifications. I love it... But give me scrollable friend lists with away messages and songs, like Instagram started doing, only better. Just take the old AIM formula and this will be the best chat app out there.",1
"I love the app really, but it has I few errors. Like to download always go of when you are not in the app any more. Could you make that when you are downloading it is visible like a notification. So that when you log out of the app it will still keep downloading. Thanks I really love the app performance. ❤️❤️❤️❤️",1
"Everything is nice but function of fast forward of telegram is worst, We can't even hear anything because of this fast forward. Instead, make the function such that while holding on the screen, it will run at 2x instead of increasing by 1x.",1
"hello telegram, please fix this update. i cannot accept that when i have to log in, i need to put my email. i need the old code back, please! my old account was from a dead email that i don't have anymore. my telegram account is very important so i always use log in and log out instead of log in using emails. please fix this, some people cannot accept it. that's all, i hope you can change this update. thank you.",1
This is Great app..but can you please add some function in this app settings like media auto Play forward for next audios... actually after finish to listening full audio the app will automatically play previous audio not next audios..and this continuesly plays previous audio will irritating..and also we have to search again which one audio we will listen last and which is next?? Please can you do any thing on this???,1
"I have been using this app for I don't even know how long. Recently I can't answer Telegram messages through my headphones, and it does not automatically connect to Bluetooth audio and I need to switch manually. This is really bothersome.",1
*Can usually only receive calls when the app it actively open and on screen (settings for background data is on and data is unrestricted). *When the app is open i still miss about 30% of the calls. This happens even with full bars for signal and even with wifi turned on.,1
"How do I turn on video autoplay? why this feature was removed( or I can't find.. tap left or right for photo navigation doesn't work. Add all the color settings to the free version please, I don't need the premium just for that, it just looks ugly(",1
"What your team did for Saved Messages 2.0 is not friendly to free users. Your team took away the ability to react to individual messages within Saved Messages from free users to monetize it via Premium. Why is the new react-to-tag function not an ""add-on"" for Premium & how does this warrant the removal of the original from free users? I get decent, free functions on other platforms that entices me to pay for more. But your team prefers to take stuff away to sell it back. Very ethical, great job!",1
"Bug: if you share a video, you can select target contacts/chats and type a message, then it shows the video clipper GUI and the ""send"" button. If you click ""send"", then it shares the video, and throws your message away. Could you fix it?",1
"Would be great if we can earn money from our channel (but not in cryptocurrency). What we've waiting for so long is shopping bot, so we can sale what we have on our channels or groups. Your animation features is more than enough. We need more than just sticker animations or something like that.",1
"Found one major flaw. Most groups do not allow you to copy text, and that's the only way to translate on this app. Ultimately the app requires an automatic translation feature to allow for more inclusivity among users.",1
"Telegram has been fantastic until recent bugs. I keep having a draft msg that cannot be deleted. Posting it, clearing cloud drafts, deleting it, etc, does nothing. And in the same chat, an old quizzarium bot i removed years ago still shows up when I enter the chat.",1
"Most times when i try to download something it just keeps spinning and wont download, my network works just fine and am able to do everything else with the same network just this download issue, if you all could look into that, it would be amazing. 😊",1
"I'm giving it 3 star because when I reinstalled the app I couldn't login to my account. It keeps on showing ""an internal error occured"" and I have done all possible corrections and adjustments. Can someone help me",1
"Screenshot and screen recording is not allowed in telegram. It's really something important. Share the file, or text only can be done within telegram and can't be forwarded to other social media or WhatsApp. Pls include all these so it could be more user friendly .",1
"Great experience, and user-friendly interface. The only thing I'm having issues is my account being restricted from commenting in public groups since I joined Telegram. I've tried contacting your support centre but there has been no response.",1
"I need to choose font size, in the text bar Where the actual text is being typed! I need to change th MAIN color WITHOUT changing the THEME color The background color order that I set, reverts, No matter how much I rotate the colors and SET Theme setting is confusing and can't change the color of incoming text bubble color, without changing MY bubble color. Theme settings are all in-one And confusing! Make font size option in main settings.LARGER TIME STAMP FONT! Calls NOT Showing FULL SCREEN",1
"I would have given 4 stars but Telegram should please try to fix this bug in the next update. Whenever a live stream is going in a channel it's a type whereby people are muted by the admins, not everyone can hear what is being said even when they have a good internet connection, but the moment they are unmuted by admin, they will be able to hear. I know it's not easy but I believe Telegram developers should see to this Thanks",1
"Telegram is a solid app overall, but the lack of nearby people feature is a drawback. It would be great if this issue could be addressed promptly for a better user experience.",1
"It used to be awesome but nowadays Im dealing with a bug wich is driving me crazy. I keep downloading a file and it shows me that it's downloaded. When i eanna open it, it doesn't like a fake downloaded thing. It's only on phone version and ive tried clearing cahs but it didn't work",1
"Wasn't A Very Good experience afterall the last update was a mess bcuz it has a big problem which is the telegram doesn't show the actual activity status for some of my friends until they interact themselves elsewhere it keeps saying ""last seen recently"" hope really ti solve this problem it gives me a brain damage",1
"Telegram used to be a nice messaging app, but the recently emerged flying bubble notifications are extremely annoying, and I cannot find their settings besides the whole service is being actively pushed to the premium.",1
"My experience with TelegramExcellent, highly recommended application. Secure, private and you're given a great palette of feature to fine tune your messaging experience to suit your taste and needs. Definitely my favorite mobile messaging application.",1
"I don't like Tons of people coming into my Platform / Site Uninvited .. I do not have the ability to Keep my Site Empty of those Uninvited .. I would like to have ONLY those that I invite to be there in My site and Not have to be Forced to have others that have not been accepted by Me .. The phone access doesn't work, I have tried many times to connect with those that I wanted to share with but was unable to do so .. Also too there is No Email access to those that manage "" Telegram """,1
The app is really good. But lately my downloaded movies are automatically deleted before I can save them to my storage. This makes it very annoying. Please fix this,1
"1 star: My app makes copies of photos on my phone when I send them to someone. All data and storage options look good. It's frustrating. Tried reinstalling, updating etc... Wrote to your support but no reply. So after a year of torture on two phones, bye. 3 Star Update: Thanks for the reply, you still don't have the option to do it immediately, but 1 day late. Once again, husband has the same phone and same options, still no problem. I'm tired of trying to fix it.",1
"I like functions and the messaging this app provides, however for the past couple of updates made it horrible. Whenever I open the app, it says ""Waiting for connection"" though my internet signal is perfect (other apps work just fine). And also Stories annoy me a bit, but that's not as crucial as the constant connection problem. (Yes, I did clear cache, reboot phone and other simple stuff). Everything else is great.",1
I love telegram but the only problem I have with this App is the fact they restrict me from messaging new friends. That's where WhatsApp is better. A person have your number and u also have theirs but they wouldn't allow you message them!,1
It's cool but not great because it dose not has connection with google account. its login with number so its not possible to be safe. If number will be register in others name it has chance that he can access my account and privacy. So please update system that can access by google account that help access my own account in any where any contry.,1
User friendly! I'm having issues on wallet KYC verification I tried to verify my wallet and next I see is that my wallet has restricted and saying that verification can only be done ✅ once that means there's nothing I can do again to retrieve back my wallet. Please 🙏 my request is for you to allow someone to verify his/her wallet twice before restriction.,1
"The app is great, but most times I don't hear anything during the live streams especially when I'm muted by the admin. I have updated the app twice, didn't make a difference. Please is the problem from me, if it is can you tell me what I'm doing wrong?",1
"Please add user blocking with timer. For example, when I want to block someone, I have the option of 24 hours, 48 ​​hours, whatever time you want, and blocking permanently. If I block a lot of people, please give me the possibility to unblock them all at once and I don't need to unblock them one by one. In the blocks section, give me the ability to sort my list of blocks and blocky robots and blocky people are separate from each other.",1
"In the starting when i started using this app, it worked smoothly and was able to download pdfs and video uninteruptly but now it stops download in between without completing whole download and just buffers there. May be it is a bug so please solve this",1
Pretty great but the push notifications are not good. Sometimes they are hours late or none at all. Edit: 3.5 years later and same issue. Notifications come hours late or not all.,1
"Would be perfect if it weren't for the bloated, useless features that you cannot disable, so you're forced to interact with it while trying to use the app.",1
"It was a very good app until recently in which after the updates it has started to delete my downloaded files or even after I have downloaded it, it doesn't open and disapears after a while, I would appriciate it if u could fix this problem",1
"The bad point in this app. Is that: When you have a connectio prob. for a few min. Or sec. Then ur post does not pass to ur frnd ........,after fixing the problm & u r connecting its impossible to resend the post......... (The post got❗️sign) u have *Resend option* after the❗️,but doesnt workkkkkkkk till○○....😵‍💫😵🥴😔😖😣😞😓& it is awful,horrible,disaster,...... Although *Whatsapp* will do it easily",1
"After updating the app, now it crashes everytime I want to send a voice message or to listen a voice message. Also it happens with one-play voice message",1
"The increase of things that are premium is starting to seriously clutter the app to the point quality is starting to tank. It's a shame because I've been using Telegram for a while. Their automatic bans need a little work because when it's wrong, innocent people have personal and meaningful group chats removed and other things, and it appears that there's nobody who volunteers for answers anymore, I asked a question 4 months ago, and it's left unread and ignored this entire time. Disappointed.",1
"Fine except - & this is a huge deal - it doesn't audio alert every time, and it never does when phone isn't closed. Need to be able to add a custom audio to it.",1
The popup notification that shows up seems misaligned on top right corner on my Oneplus Nord CE 3 5G. Latest version of both app as well as phone OS. It seems fine on lockscreen notification as well as notification drawer but pop up notification is misaligned. Developer kindly note this.,1
"Without premium payment please increase the download speed,if you do that it will be a unique feature than other downloader apps. All users will grateful if you done.please. In addition,Start a system so that when something is downloaded it shows up in the notification. Many times when you download something in Telegram, it closes in the background. It's very annoying. So it is my humble request to you that if I download something, it should appear in the notification",1
"This app has given me the best experience a messaging app could give. But lately, after the last update, the app has been having glitches. Some Messages overlap and some of them disappear. I have to close and reopen the app every time thus happens. I don't know if this is my phone's problem. But I hope you could fix it!",1
"Removing 2* because recently i was approached by random scammers in Telegram. Seemed something new, wanted to see where it leads and 1h later i found myself in a crypto scam hive, full of bots and fake people sending screenshot of thousands of USDT (Tron-20) deposits making fake profits, i stalled and made excuses to the required deposit, so i can investigate further. I reported to Telegram admins and hope they take the hive down. Sadly i could not report the person with no number just nickname.",1
"I can't figure out how to get help so will try here. I have been asked to use this ap for communication with one person. I have tried to get my computer and my phone to download it. I would prefer computer if that could happen but it seems that it is not possible.? I see that the ap is free, but also get blocked by security issues. I am worried about security and also cannot figure out why I cannot get the ap to download. Sorry - I am not computer savvy and honestly worry about safety",1
"It's an expressible chatting app from all. But the updates are getting only premium. Downloading stories, animated emojis, profile color, the folders are limited(only 10) and etc. It's like we can't enjoy it fully. If premium is off for these features it would be more than amazing!!! But as a user or a fan we suggest this Idea. Thank you!!",1

"Your app fell off from the February of 2024, it became slow and buggy and a lot of accounts and groups get banned for no good reason. IDK what happened to you admins but your app used to be great...I guess it's time to switch back to Discord and put down Telegram for good. was fun using your app in 2023, thanks :)",1

Telegram is not so bad but when I download something it download for only few minutes and after I have toh download it again my time and data both got wasted so I rate 3 out of 5 stars,1
"Changing my review from 5 stars to 3 because I am facing problems for downloading a lot of files nowadays, it gets stuck in between for hours and hours",1
"Security qnd privacy issue: recently i get added to groups and channels automatically. My privacy settings for getting added to groups and channels is on ""nobody"". Also there is no other active session on my account, only my phone. I tried everything but nothing works. Seems like hackers find a bug in this software and devs don't do anything about it",1
It has been a year I have been trying to log in to my telegram id but I always fail then I tried logging into telegram X I failed again. Plz let me know how can I lov into my telegram id!,1
"Basically it's a good app to watch animes, kdramas,movies and manyy more....but whenever I download any file on telegram it got stuck at a point and then it will not be downloaded.... it's very irritating and frustrating..so telegram please fix this issue😐",1
"Literally the best app for messaging and having fun, but still has a lot of flaws, such as not removing harmful content efficiently",1
First time I got some bug or some issue when we used it with celular data it works perfectly but when we Swift to WiFi it stop msg sending or any type of download or opening any type of videos images. Solve it please,1
"AFTER LAST UPDATE, I HAD TO UNINSTALL THE TELEGRAM APP. BECAUSE I CANNOT UPLOAD OR DOWNLOAD MEDIA (VIDEOS, AUDIO, PHOTOS) MESSAGES. YOUR INAPP BOWSER IS VERY VERY SLOW AS COMPARED TO WHATSAPP BOWSER. 1ST IT UNCOMPRESSED THE VIDEOS THAN UPLOAD ON INTERNET, WHEREAS IN WHATSAPP VIDEOS CAN SEND AS IT IS. ALL MY FRIENDS HAVE LEFT OR UNINSTALL TELEGRAM APP. YOU HAVE TO ADD FEATURES LIKE WHATSAPP REGULARLY OTHERWISE YOUR APP RATING WILL GO DOWN BELOW THE PRESENT RATING.",1
"I don't know why my telegram didn't work, I updated my phone trying to open my telegram account but you didn't send me the verification code and it's not verifying automatically by calling phone, this problem take me almost a week now without solution,, pls resolved my issue if possible",1
"My overall rating would have been 4 to 5 but 3 reflects my current opinion. Bugs are accumulating faster. Ex: share a bot to a TG contact works intermittently ; same for sharing pics either from gallery or after a screenshot; emojis shuffle around or are not being proposed at their selection moment; saving is cumbersome; etc. Story bar is just annoying. Hope these will get fixed and TG returns as it was. Redmi Note 8 (powerful app, nevertheless)",1
Just add one feature of staring messages in chat so that we can find important messages from bulk whenever we want .,1
"The app is useful but sometimes, the account can be hacked n send messages without the user knowing. It sends scam linkss n all. Please do check it.",1
Telegram is a good app but I have serious issues when it comes to messaging. I have been given restrictions back to back. Once a restriction expires another one is given immediately. I don't know what I did or what I'm not doing right but one thing I know for sure is that I've not violated any rules. I don't spam people or groups rather it's people I don't know that send me messages. This has been happening since last year and I'm getting fed. It has made things difficult for me.,1
"The recent updates have spoiled the control on proxy connection while it worked great some months ago. In our region, proxy usage or proxy capability is above all other advantages. Please fix it again, this app is the God of all.. 💯❤",1
"UPD: Developers' response is not helpful and doesn't address the original question. Please, add settings to ""not see any stories"" on my app, including telegram own stories. It's exhausting, and half of users clearly hate it. Hiding stories one by one is a bad solution, and UI is messy. I don't want to clean the interface on almost daily basis (hello, electrician from 10 years ago in my telegram? really?), I want them gone entirely.",1
I love this app but theres something wrong if i close it and i want to enter again it tells me telegram isnt responsible i wonder how. You got to work on that,1
"i regret buying premium - my experience became a nightmare, i cant send videos, sending photos takes minutes. minutes! i cant use camera in app to take photo, it broke ages ago without hope. is this a special kind of torture? how long does it take to fix bugs of the most base function of a messenger? but hey, at least i have tons of animated emotes and features now, yes?",1
Very nice app. But recently this issue is coming that videos that I download keep on deleting itself. This is very disappointing and confusing as well.,1
Meh. Could use some tweaks. I've made them known and nothing is changed so no point in bringing them up again. If they care they'll read this and reach out and ACT on suggestions not just from me but from many spanning over a year or more. Don't get your hopes up tho ladies n germs,1
the best app. But the only but the most important reason that I gave 3 stars is that my channel members can save my restricted media in file manager. also it's possible to get each message link and get the media from some bots. Please fix this bug and support copyright contents more. Thanks,1
"I'm using this app by a long time ago. It was one of most the best apps for me, but these days, I'm facing a ridiculous problem with this app. It just shows ""connecting"" while on the cellular data or on wifi, too. This is too much teased for us. I wish this problem must be solved as early as possible",1
"After the latest update, the app hangs very frequently. Also the wallet shows an error message.",1
"I'm sorry i had to give this app only 3 stars but the way the same notifications keep popping up in my navugation bar repeatedly and that i have to remove them over and over again -sometimes it takes me up to 6 times- until they're gone is super annoying please fix this, thanks.",1
"i dont know whats happening but it keeps on saying ""reconnecting.."" even though my wifi is strong? i can use other apps perfectly. and i cant even load messages because its keep saying i am not connected to the Internet.",1
"Hello. I just paid for telegram premium monthly subs today morning, after adding my card information and make the transaction I got a debit alert of 2,990 so after 1 hour I still receive another debit alert of 2,990 and this is my first time of subscribing to the premium and I got debited twice. Why?",1
Uncomfortable UI. When you have a lot channels it shows like a chaos trash.,1
"After all these years, Auto-Night Mode is still not working 😐",1
"I love telegram, but recently a new feature has been added that I hate, channels recommended, is a feature that shows me channels without me searching for them, please remove this as it is a privacy concern for users who have to share their phone",1
"Telegram is a great app, definitely better than Whatsapp. Things like being able to send videos without terrible compression, cute stickers and true multi device support are awesome. But there's a dark side, the constant spam from fake always good looking women messaging me. I'd like to block non-contacts from messaging me, but guess what, this feature is behind paywall. It should not be, it's a security matter and in fact should be on by default.",1
I'm sorry for the telegram that its wallet is limited to Iranians,1
I and my wife wanted to set this up. But it was too hard to figure out how to get the result in the end??!,1

Please can I at least get a feedback and my appeal considered? I don't spam neither do I text strangers. And with the future of TON, telegram is integral. Please respond to my complaint. Thanks.",1

Everything's good about this app but sending a message it takes too long for a message to take and send if you could fix the sending a message and how long it takes to get from one place to the next where a conversation could be more enjoyable instead of waiting for day sometime before your message gets to the sender that you're sending it to doesn't have to be incredible but until that gets fixed this app is just okay I wouldn't recommend it to anybody to talk on right now,1

All cheating activities are done in this app majorly,1
This is a great app!! One thing that would be really great is if Telegram would enable us to download a copy of the voice messages in a chat as an MP3 file. whilst still keeping the original in the chat feed. Perhaps this could be in a future update? :)) Please get rid of the circular videos.. it's really annoying and it looks horrible when you try to save it on your phone. Why can't it be a regular full screen video??,2
"I don't want it to start a new thread every single time a contact joins telegram. I have the notification turned off in the settings for this, but it still happens. Other than that telegram is great but it is so annoying when it does that and gets super cluttered. If I want to start a new chat with someone, I will start a thread. I don't need it to do that for me and clutter up my messages!! Plz fix.",2
"It's a great app that I can use to talk to all sorts of people and be as organized about it as I need to be! Just one problem, every now and then there would be a glitch that would hide all my folders, so whichever folder is the main one I start with is what I would be stuck with until I restart Telegram. And also when navigating, when I'm editing a reply and I accidentally swipe a little to the left, it goes back to the main screen and I lose progress of what I was editing",2
"Easy to Navigate. Super versatile. Fun Emojis! The best message app I have used so far. Quick movie downloads. Can edit messages after posting, add bold letters. Can delete message for all persons if I make a mistake, great group message app. Can also make phone calls or video calls. Save videos on ""saved messages"". Only issue are the bots/spammers on some Channels if the ""group admin"" is not keeping. They delete account after 6 months of inactivity,you loose everything or forget password",2
"Gave it a shot to subscribe to telegram premium for $36 a year. The premium subscription doesn't give you a free trial, one week would be nice. If you cancel, your membership continues till 1 year anniversary, then simply does not renew. No prorated refund. I did not find any benefits in the premium subscription in the features that are worth paying for for me.",2
"Usually telegram is awesome, can't recommend it enough however, I recently upgraded to the Samsung S24 Ultra and now the voice memos AND video message microphone does not work. I have tried all the ""fixes"" I could find on YouTube, but none of them have worked so far. Maybe an update needs to come out or something because this is not good.",2
"One of the best messaging apps out there. But a long list of issues with the calling functionality: -Can't connect to Android Auto -Can't connect to Bluetooth headphones during call, have to hangup and call back. -Video chats used to annoyingly rotate even when you had rotation off on the phone. -Now it will not rotate AT ALL, only on IOS. -I've had these issues going on for the past 2 years. PLEASE FIX",2
"Pavel and Co have to fix smth. I have started using Telegram when I lived in Ukraine years ago. I can tell it's the best on the market! I took out one star only because since they added video calls, there's an issue that still presents. When I switch from voice call to video or back, it never goes automatically to the speaker or back. Never. I have to push on screen, then to find a tiny phone button and click on it to change to speaker. It's really annoying. Hope you'll fix it. Thanks for app!",2
"Great, robust and multi-functional communication app with more features than all the others out there. The absolute best one out there. Only issue I have recently is sharing from a just made camera video via Google photos-telegram crashes and fails to send the video directly from the camera. I have to go into telegram and hit the attachment 📎 button and select the video, then it sends. Didn't have this issue before I upgraded from Android 10 to 12 with a new phone. Please fix, thanks!",2
"See ""Overall"" praise below. But since the last update, for the first time EVER, I was *NOT* notified of new messages while the app wasn't open. Once open, the little icon appeared in the task bar. Seems like a bug--if so, needs a fix!! Overall: I really love this app, for the security and privacy features, customization options, file-sharing in storage location of choice, all the stickers, etc. If the app had video chatting and conferencing, I'd actively recruit my friends to use this.",2
"Nice app. But voice calling thru proxy is not good: some interferences and noises occur all the time using Wi-Fi connection only. And a very annoying issue: every time after the update, the proxy setting becomes disabled. User should activate available proxy manually. It's very inconvenient for older people who have no idea how to set it up after each update.",2
"Telegram is the best out there, with non-stop cool new updates adding brand-new features every time. But the in-app video player is awful; I remember the old version... That was far better. There has been some bugs recently as well; one is that when you send a message and press the back icon, it shows two ticks for that message, which means ""seen"" while it's not.",2
"I absolutely love the app and in my honest opinion, I would say it's almost perfect. I wish voice calling was a little better cause it almost never connects and I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this problem but I sometimes don't receive notifications until I actually open the app. Other than that, it's a great app with a great layout and the variety of stickers and one of my favorite features would be the video messaging, it would be nice if it was longer than one minute though.",2
"Good app, relatively stable aside from a few hiccups here and there, I use it quite frequently. I wish there was a way to create folders to organize chats and groups better, as one long list can be overwhelming. For example, I'd create a folder for close friends, another for group chats, then one for channels. Would be a nice feature and perhaps something the devs can look into, even some of my friends think it's a good idea.",2
"Great app, by far the best compared to their competitors. But lately, I'm noticing the app continues to increase in internal storage. I also notice that its becoming more buggy with each update. I'm seeing the same thing happening with Whatsapp too. I think these 2 rivals are competing to see who can provide better features (even though telegram takes the win on that one), rather than to fix the stability of their own apps. Eventually they'll address the complaints about stability, but when?",2
"This annoying popup notification keeps appearing when someone sends me a message. I have turned off popup notifications and have disabled the app from appearing on top of other apps, and yet the notification still appears. After some googling, I found on reddit that it's a Samsung feature called ""smart pop-up view"", I have since disabled it for telegram (no idea why it was enabled in the first place, I obviously did not know that feature existed). All in all, good app.",2
"I have only two gripes with Telegram. The first is that the audio does not go to my wireless earpiece during calls. The second, being if it's been up for awhile, it will not switch to landscape when I turn the phone over. It would also be cool if the phone app could export chat history like the desktop version. Otherwise, it's perfect.",2
"Good service/app, hate having images being skipped because i tapped the right or left side of the screen trying to double-tap to zoom in or make the info disappear, whereas it used to be that it would only advance or go back when swiped. It now does both. Please include an option in the settings to control this. Other than that, it's a good app.",2
"Love the app in general! Long time user, long enough that I have made custom stickers and everything. But there's been a few bad changes lately, and there's literally no way to talk to a support team. Only volunteers that don't know any more than you. Sticker packs now automatically move to the top of the list when you use them. I had all my packs sorted and memorized. The sticker history is enough. Don't reorganize my packs for me!",2
"Great app. I switched from Viber after I realized that some of messages were not being delivered. Telegram seems vastly better. I just used it once to call and the sound quality was exceptional, it felt like the person I was talking to was right next to me, even though I was talking to someone on a different continent. The only thing I don't like is that I had to agree to Telegram recording my audio when I only wanted to talk to someone in a live conversation, not record voice messages.",2
"This app was great until an update sometime in February. Now the app frequently gets stuck in a ""connecting"" status. Fixing it is inconsistent and either requires connecting to a VPN, force closing everything and resetting connection, or restarting the entire device. Very frustrating since I have moved a number of people over to Telegram and now it's not working for them. Many are switching back to WhatsApp or Signal. Not as secure, but at least they always work. Very disappointed.",2
"Generally great, but still some issues to improve: 1. Can't forward grouped images to groups whose slow model are enabled. The grouped images will be recognized as multiple messages. 😅 2.Audio player is quite simple. Hope you can add step backward & forward 10s options and apply multiple options for speed control, not just 2x. 🥺 3.Still, thank you for your hard work. 👍",2
"Telegram is a very good, interesting, and efficient app. It's the best between messaging apps. It's have built-in proxy, modern appearance, free cloud, high security, fast updates, entertaining futures... But it's came so heavy recently, even for high-end phones! I disabled all animations. However, i still have lag in my brand new samsung keyboard when i use telegram.",2
"So right off the bat, if you want to see everything, download the app from the telegram website. The app store and playstore versions will not show some groups. Only found that out when some in a group I'm in was sharing things from other pages and nothing was loading. This app gets frequently updated. Not that long ago, there was two updates in the same day. Most updates are under 80MB. The UI is decent.",2
"It's a great app, the only con is that whenever I try to send someone a video, picture or gif, it says it sends, but it constantly buffers and the other person who I send it to can see that I tried to send either a video, picture or gif and they say that they can't see the image, it constantly buffers. Other than that, I love this app!",2
I love this app. Works good for me. But recently I think I found a bug. I'm on Android 11 now on a Google pixel and I've noticed my notifications don't always work. I will miss messages from people because the push notification never goes through. It will work fine for a short time after opening app but later throughout the day I miss them. When I'm listening to music on my volume wilk drop for a notification but no sound and nothing in notifications bar. I will open the app and see messages.,2
"I have a pocophone f1 and after the most recent update (5.12.1) I'm not getting any notifications. I have to open the app to see if I have any messages. Before I had an issue with not getting any calls when my phone is locked (just get a messed call notification) but I could live with that somewhat but this bug is real annoying. All permissions have been granted and notifications have been reset to default in the app. -They fixed it 😁😁, thanks!",2
"I really enjoy and recommend this app however there's still lots of features that can be added , and also, it has a bunch of bugs too!! As I experienced when playing a music and someone's calling then app will be closed and music will not continue playing, also auto-night mode is never worked for me , it's always in dark/light mode when I change it manually",2
"Hi. I use Telegram v9.3.3 (3026) with Android 13. I think there is a problem with your new update. When I use telegram and play a sound track within Telegram sometimes it stops working and the sound track does not resume when you play it again. For example the sound track stops at minute 13 but you when it stops, it goes to minute 0. Please help to fix this problem. Thanks.",2
"Generally, I've found Telegram to be a fairly technologically advanced communications system. I'll find it useful for speaking to people internationally, because it's free and fairly reliable. The only problem that I've had with it is connection difficulty when on call. I'm hoping that these technological difficulties will be corrected soon.",2
"Would give a 5. App is perfect. But recently have been having lots of issues, some messages are coming in either as double or from ""multiple chats"" when I look at a computer and only have 1 message. I uninstalled and reinstalled today and all the messages that haven't been read were marked as read, yet the time last online was before the message sent.",2
I enjoy the app in the years that I've had my account. However I have recently been dealing with a couple bugs. If I search for a message in a chat it will skip months worth of text. But it only happens if I use the search bar so it's a hassle manually looking for specific texts. Hopefully this gets fixed soon. Other than that the app is great. By far one of mh favorite social media platforms.,2
"I like the overall design of the app except there needs to be a video button 🔘 up at the top beside a call button🔘. Using video conference or chatting via video is super important.But the app doesn't have in-call video which is really frustrating, it will only let me video chat through my phone interface,not through the app. Other than that the app is fine.",2
"Telegram is a good app because it doesn't go slow but sometimes, it has bugs with it too but I decided to rate 4/5 stars! What I like about the app is that you can send texts, emojis, files, photos and many more. What I don't like about the app is it doesn't send notifications which I'm fine with that. Also, I have friends using this app but It's not worth it if your friends don't have Telegram. I'm using Samsung Chromebook 3 and I have no problems still so far but I won't mind about that.",2
The app is amazing as I've used it to interact with my bf for about 3 years now and we are happy to have such an app to communicate through and be able to use stickers. However i do have one issue that started recently. For some reason when i get a notification from the app I get a major text box that forces my phone to turn on and display the message. I have no idea why this started or how to remove it.,2
Id love to give this app 5/5 b/c akmost everything is amazing! Secure messaging. STICKERS! Group messaging. Easy to use. I absolutely love *almost* everything. But. Voice recordings? Nearly impossible to get to work. And I KNOW its not just me. We hit play and the screen flickers black and keep pausing the recordings. Its crazy hard to listen to anything. I hope they fix this soon.,2
"I enjoy using Telegram. Took me a bit to figure the nuances/differences from other apps. The only bothersome thing to me is that the people or groups I follow appear in such a random order, it's hard to find exactly the person or group I want to check. I have to really look to find it--it's so random and not alphabetized. Aside from this, it is my preferred platform because the info is not censored.",2
"The app is getting better, but I can't move from WhatsApp yet because it lacks some features. Message history is very important to me for record keeping (that's why I need to move from WA - daily backups get really tiring. Kudos to TG for persistent history) and in this app you have an option to clear the chat on both sides. If I have data I wish to keep, I don't want to find it suddenly got erased! There's also the really annoying ""Your contact joined Telegram"". I have over 4k contacts",2
"This app is perfect. Better than WA if we're being honest. It keeps stories instead of removing them after 24 hours, you have an option to remove them if you want. It keeps your chat history for you. You can remove chats from both parties without leaving a trace. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i wish it had a built in translatior, I have turkish, arab and Serbian friends who don't speak English and we have to use an external app to translate which sometimes is tiring.",2
"Probably one of the best messaging apps out there with all the features it offers such as text formatting, spoilering content, sorting chats with images, voice, video, gifs, and files, very customizable to get a look you like, fun stickers, save gifs for easy access and more! Calling sucks though so don't bother using that, the quality is usually really bad and drops constantly, you're better off just calling them with a phone number or using another app. If someone has this app, they're sus",2
"In general, it is a really balanced and good app. When you share a photo taken with a camera, the quality will drop. Many app features require premium. For example, tagging in saved messages is a necessary thing that was always lacking. Another strange thing... On the free plan, it is only possible to have 5 favorite stickers, but on the premium 200 stickers!!! I think it is better to upgrade 5 to 10 and the premium 20...",2
The app is perfectly functional and I like it more than other messaging apps. But why does every app feel the need to mess with notifications and invent new ways for my SILENT notifications to be loud and annoying. Please stop trying to do this. You were perfect already. Now you're on the slippery slope to being unusable garbage. Please don't turn your app into unusable garbage.,2
"I love Telegram as the best messaging app that I've seen. However, lately Telegram has this very weird bug: I have some chats that satisfy that every time I open them, I appear in 2022. Moreover, I don't really get notifications about new messages in these chats. They just appear up in the chat list, but without any sign of a new messages...",2
"The first thing I want to say is that this is the best messaging app in the market. However, one thing I don't like about Telegram is that every time I download a file like a PDF or image from any group or individual, the file's name gets automatically changed in the file location. It's very irritating when I try to search for that particular file in the Telegram media folder using a file manager. Please fix this issue so that after downloading, the file name remains the same.",2
"Telegram is really good and so far I'm enjoying it. Only issue is that when I'm downloading a file , it downloads upto the end and then suddenly it says file is not downloaded try again. So basically my time and data gets wasted and it gets very frustrating because it consumes lot of data. At times mid way it stops downloading and restarts. So kindly look into this. Rest is good.",2
Hi I've been using this app for few months . It's good . But has a major flaw in it . I went to cancel a message and in process deleted all. By accident it has also deleted a friends. Couldn't get it back from back up. Surely you should not be able to delete all messages from another person's phone . This should never happen doesn't on other apps. Please sort this out . How many other people has this happened to.,2
"Only problems with this app is that, it's UI is kindof cluttered. Like it does not feel organised. Second problem is that sometimes if I download a very large file, it will show that it's 100% downloaded but then it will not load onto my device. And when I check back, it's either not even downloading or at 10-30%",2
"Telegram is actually a good platform but i want to bring your attention to a minor issue but it sometimes create a sort of confusion. The thing is it keep showing ""online"" almost about 5 minutes even after the person had went offline already. I've tried deleting chat history and clearing the cache but the issue still remains. I'll be thankful if you could fix this issue. Thank you for reading :)",2
"Alright now here's the problem #1: Telegram keeps saving the pics and gifs and videos i download to the gallery. No matter what I do, it does it even though it doesn't have the permission. #2: New update has that videos Start playing like gifs right after they get downloaded. I don't like that and please make an option to turn off this feature. Tnx",2
I am a long term telegram user and I love this app too much. I am never good with words but still I am writing this review as basic social media user. I love the animations and all and their lots of feature to explore for a power user and I really appreciate that but recently have encountered a sync issue. Every time I open the app it shows upload your contacts but it the setting is already own and I have uninstalled and reinstalled this and still the problem not fixed. That's why it's 4/5.,2
"The app is absolutely amazing, but unfortunately I have one issue which really disappointed me. I have a Google Pixel 8 Pro and when I take a photo with HIRES 50 px and I send it in it looks fully messy with compression, if you will compare with 12 px everything is absolutely fine.",2
"Dear Telegram Team, Our account has been inexplicably closed without any justification or error on our part. We relied on this application for educational purposes, and it's disheartening that there's no customer support available. Despite multiple emails sent to the Telegram team, we haven't received a satisfactory response yet. We urge you to enhance your service. Thank you.",2
The app has been great but I noticed some glitch and yesterday morning I uninstalled it and reinstalled and till now login is a problem it's taking forever for the code to arrive... It will be great to have alternative means of getting the code maybe via email or something. Thank you I've received the code and I'm enjoying the app again,2
"I requested a few things, and recently they've been added (per chat bookmark); hence, I would like to update my review. It's been a great app to use on a day-to-day basis. There are a few bugs that have been pending for a very long time that need to be resolved urgently, such as secret chat auto-deleting.",2
"I love using telegram, but I always struggle when I download a file or video. After it completes downloading and I want to download it to my files or just try to open it ..it becomes undownloaded again and I start download it once again then it becomes undownloaded I really don't know what to do I sometimes let what I want although it's important. Please tell me what it's the problem (thefifth star after this problem is fixed",2
Love telegram but for some reason I keep getting notifications for pinned posts in (muted) groups even after I've already seen them. It's a bit annoying.. A feature that could be a game changer is keeping your profile picture private but ONLY SHARE IT WITH SOME GROUPS. I belong to some trusted groups that I don't mind sharing my pictures with but I definitely don't want to have it public..,2
"After the Last update, I've encountered an issue in Telegram channels where I receive notifications first, followed by the actual message after a 5-minute delay. I believe it's a bug. Please resolve it promptly. Apart from that, it's a very good application.",2
"There is a bug where the download just cancels itself midway, other than that there are only a few minor bugs that needs to be fixed.But if move that aside this is a great app,infact one of the best ones that I've ever used.The features and design are all perfect",2
My experience with this app is very good but I have just a issue which is that my friend has send a link to join the group but whenever I click on it it says the link is expired I have even refreshed the link and tried but still it doesn't works. Please resolve this issue,2
"It has a lot of features, and by that, I mean a LOT. Most of them behind the paywall, but the basic features are free to use. Even though it has all these features, the main chatting features doesn't feels as robust as WhatsApp's, which is kind of disappointing when you're a long time whatsapp user wanting to switch",2
Please fix the uploading issue. Whenever I send something after it's finished it's always failed for some reason. It's literally annoying like Sometimes you need to repeat 10x just to send it successfully. I don't have any issue with my storage and internet. I think it's just The uploading issue. Thank you.,2
The chat features can be improved. I got problems when sending long videos to the chat. The Action and audio of the video doesn't play synchronously. The video plays delayed than the audio.,2
"it's perfect and all, but I'm giving it 4 stars because we need more features in ""custom notifications""! All of us are following some useful channels on telegram but we're just there for some specific messages, and it'd be cool to have a feature when a specific word is mentioned in a message, we get notified for that specific message.",2
"Самый прикольный мессенджер. Просто кайф пользоваться. Тот кто придумал Гений ! Changed: Everything was excellent till I noticed that audio quality during a call is kinda meh comparing to over apps with same features. - Well and I do not think that adding a quick reaction features was a great idea, i mean it loads app with useless things. However, myb I'm wrong if devs managed to optimize everything. ! Abnormal power consumption on Android 10",2
"please do this little modification: MUTE button is below the interface. Whenever i press back button from the mobile, many of the times the unmute channel got muted and it stopped receiving the important notifications. It will be better if u give mute button top right corner near 3 dot option. This will reduce the accidental pressing of the mute button.",2
"Ok, it needs a new feature. ""Drunk text protection"". You can set contacts that you CAN NOT text/call during a certain time. Assume, you're going to a party. And you set up 1 contact that you can not text during the next 18 hours. To unlock this contact earlier, you'd have to go to settings and input your password (can't be copied and pasted). Just think about it.",2
"It'll be better if you put where you chat with people and where you group in a different place than mixing it all up, group and contacts should be in a different place, than scrolling to chat with someone and your seeing more groups than contacts, you can separate so people will see contacts where they are meant to be and see groups where they are also meant to be, apart from that it's cool by the way⭐.Thanks. And also,is it possible for you guys to make telegram app to be gifting 1-10gb per day",2
"I'm not normally critical of apps I've grown to love and depend on, and I don't need obscure features, but please, could downloading videos not choke with absolutely tiny amounts until they are finished? If the video is 2 mb or 100, it doesn't matter, the last 100 KILOBYTES hang forever, I'm getting deja vu from the 56k-flex era 😳",2
"Way better than WhatsApp in pretty much all aspects. Overall an excellent app, but I really need an option to completely disable/hide stickers from a personal perspective. I find them way too distracting and spammy.",2
"The app doesn't work in Android Auto. If you receive an incoming call, you have no way to answer it, as the phone transfers it to Android Auto, but the car display shows nothing. Please fix this issue. The issue persists with different phones and different cars, with wired and wireless connection.",2
"Truly the best messenging service imo, thank you Telegram team for your work. BUT One problem since last update tho: a notification badge pops up regularly on the home screen but I don't have a new notification or a new message. I don't know where it comes from and it's frustrating me EDIT: I think it's for Stories? Any way to disable that? I can't find the option for that in badge notification. Plz help ty",2
"Please I'm having difficulty signing in into my Telegram, it's been 3 weeks now and yet not working. Whenever I input my number, it loads and says “An Internal Error Occures” and “Unable to Send SMS” It's been like this since 3 weeks now, I've tried with my other 2 phone numbers, yet says same thing. I've uninstalled and downloaded again, cleared cache/storage, and even updated the app..yet same issue",2
"All messengers shall have hidden contact feature for better privacy which shall not appear in the main inbox of contacts , rather they could only be found by contact search 🔎 tool and the hidden contact can only be found by putting numeric PIN along with disappearing messages set to users time . There shall not be any mention of hidden contacts and only can be found by putting the numeric PIN , That makes privacy better",2
"It's good but until you haven't updated it through several 10 MB patches in Google Play! If you do so, the app starts malfunctioning and doesn't show you some messages in channels or private chats. Moreover, you can lose your scheduled nessages or have other types of problem managing like deleting them.",2
"The app is good but when I want to delete some of the sticker packs I can't due to the command no longer being there. I really hope you can bring that command back so I can delete those sticker packs. Could you also make a command where we can rename the sticker packs and change the emoji for the stickers?. Oh btw there was one time when the app used 28GB of my data just by running in the background, may I know if this is normal? Cause it has never happened to my friends and family before.",2
"It's a good messaging app with lots of awesome features, but the video messages stopped being recorded at some point. Also, there's lots of spam and it's amount doesn't change over the time.",2
"app is overall fine, but for the past few months ive been encountering a bug where the person i am texting looks like theyre online and typing when in fact theyre offline. this happens frequently and it's frustrating.",2
"When I download files usually of small mb ( like 5.8 mb ) , it often freezes at 2.0 mb. After clearing cache or waiting for some time, the download doesn't finish. Overall, it is a good messaging app. But please try to fix or suggest some solutions for this problem.",2
"I like telegram over WhatsApp. Feels more polished and loaded with way more customizations and features. Also, it's easier to use same account on multiple devices as well backups to phone number instead of a email.",2
"I like this app, but when I press the subscribe button to upgrade my Telegram account to the Premeum account, it keeps running into an error every time. It won't proceed to the payment section. I need to upgrade my account.",2
"Hello I am daily user of telegram..it was all ok before but after yesterday and today's update, the scheduled posts are not getting posted on time and also sometimes never getting posted any time. Kindly look into this matter as it is getting difficult to post time. It an earnest request to solve this issue as soon as possible. Thanks",2
"I wish blocking was a permanent thing that cannot be undone (as in once you block someone, they can never be unblocked). Also wish blocking someone who is in a group chat with you makes it so they are unable to see your messages and you can't see theirs, much like on X/Twitter. Would make things much easier to avoid individuals you don't like interacting with you in the GC, and avoid having to publicly tell them to not talk to you and make a scene that makes things awkward for everyone.",2
Overall a good app for everyone. As a student this is very helpful in studies and chatting with friends. And group are also good and video quality is brilliant but using more data and battery also finish fast.,2
"Great app but recently whenever i edit the themes coloring, it won't get saved. I tried deleting cache, or even deleting and reinstalling the app completely, but it didn't work.",2
"It's a great app. I have enjoyed 10 years of using it. However, there have been several bugs every time. For example, whenever somebody deletes a music that I have sent to a group, the music file gets deleted from my phone, too. Moreover, I have no access to videos, photos, music files, and all documents in my phone's file manager. This has been challenging for me since I can not save my favourite files and delete others.",2
I love the app they're doing great. Just that I've been banned from sending messages to groups and non mutual contacts for a very long time now. I've laid complain that I didn't do anything they accused me of to warrant blocking my account. Till now the issue has not been resolved. Pls help me resolve this @telegram,2
I'm deducting one stat bcoz the interface of this app is very cluttered. It really takes some time to get used to it and understand all its features.,2
A great app but the recent ads are mostly spam/scam. A small video or game/shopping ads are acceptable but most of the ads I see are about other groups of which most are fraud ones which tries to sell a misleading course/ scam you with false promises!,2
"Dear Telegram Team, i am using telegram for more than a year and now today I was downloading a video file it downloaded but when I tried to open it it didn't open i downloaded it again but still it didn't open i think it is a bug i am currently using Android 6.1 version please fix it if that is a bug i am a regular telegram user please please fix that bug",2
"The best messenger app. Have been using it since ages ago. Can't rate 5/5 stars due to a small bug that makes a telegram experience not 100% smooth. On my S23 series, whenever I try to attack a media (picture/video) file in a chat using a 📎 button, the refresh rate drops down to 60, which is rather unpleasant considering 120 FPS everywhere else in the app. That is the key dislike of mine. Additionally, I'd prefer the app to use the mail camera in the same 📎 window so I don't have to long press",2
"I really like the app but one thing I really want you to do is to add a save to device option on the downloads page rather than having to go to the chats page, it would be a really helpful feature. Thank you",2
"This app is very good but while I am downloading a file it keeps downloading to end, but suddenly it says the file is not downloaded yet and ask me to download it again.... This is happening only two three times recently... Features are awesome please fix it..",2
"Great app! But there's something i strongly need to be added in this app and that feature is ""disable story"" i don't know if i'm the only person who don't like the story feature but please let us to disable story",2
"I wanted to bring to your attention a minor issue l've been experiencing with the Telegram app's chat feature. I've noticed that whenever I receive a message, the app displays the ""sender typing"" indicator even though the sender has already sent the massage and is not actually typing anymore. It's not a big problem but it does cause some inconvenience and abrupt the flow. Thanks.",2
"There's a really annoying issue with the app, regarding the way it controls notifications. Even if my phone is on Do not disturb, private message notifications still ring out loud. I've experimented with the notification settings both in the app and on the Android menu and I've found that you always have to make weird compromises. If you try to adjust your message priority level, it may solve the issue of ringing out but at the cost of lock screen notifications and floating notifications.",2
"I enjoy using Telegram very well especially its storage capacity and for the fact that what ever is sent to telegram doesn't disappear I commend the developers of this app. But I have one challenge that I want you to look at, when scrolling, I noticed when I put my mouse cursor or I tap the scroll line it takes me to the exact place where I tapped, instead of scrolling to the next page, this has been making my work difficult it will be better if it's left the way it is in documents. Thanks",2
"Why do you have to cut out the older features in order to be better everytime. Sometimes it doesn't work like that rather it creates difficulties for the users. Bring back the feature to send by option ""scheduled until online"". Now it is only there but it doesn't work. So what's the use of it, only for show ? It doesn't have the feature to scheduled send from more than a year either.",2
"I just love it, if I'd have to say something I'd like to change, it will be the fact that you can not hide or remove stories from the main window, I don't use stories at all, and sice it was added it just get in the way, so please, add a method to hide it from main view or move it to a different window. Apart from that, everything is great, thanks for the great work ☺️",2
"Everything is fine except the downloaded files are hidden somewhere, Hard to find them. It creates a lot of disillusionment.",2
"App is great and everything is perfect but there is request. For videos playing in the app, there should be a speed option of 1.25×. this would be really helpful for students.",2

I love this app. The only thing I don't like is that I cannot see the call logs like in a separate part or something. I work with clients and sometimes I need to check if I had called or not. I have to go through the chat and see it from there. :( I love the app though:),2
How to recover forgotten passcode as I didn't find any other option.,2

"Время от времени, если в группе сделать поиск по слову Адвокат (поиск не в конкретном топике, а сквозь все топики в группе), то он выдает результат поиска по этому слову сквозь вообще все ваши сообщения и все чаты, в которые вы добавлены или следите. Происходит только когда телеграмм какое-то время работал в фоне и был заново вызван Также время от времени включаются поставленные на паузу голосовые сообщения, например ночью в три часа. Я наблюдал это с сообщениями в канале @trsch",2

"Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 800 million active users.",2
Ok,2
Very interesting appp,2
My Telegram account just got banned and I haven't done anything. Look into it thanks.,2
"Been using this app for years now, and it's easily my favorite messaging app, period. Consistent updates and improvements, amazing animations, and it runs so smoothly. A feature I would like to see come to telegram: The ability to ""friend request"" people. Adding as contacts works, but there is no indication of if someone adds you, and it doesn't have to be mutual. I think having a ""friends"" system would make a lot of sense for tellegram.",2
"Telegram is often misunderstood as a secure, end-to-end encrypted chat app. In truth, while E2EE is an option (not the default), this is more like a standard chat app with channels (basically chat rooms) and the option to use E2EE. If you want that privacy, there are other apps for that but Telegram is definitely a good way to stay in contact with friends and content creators in a more accessible way that other, more secure options. Definitely a better choice than Whatsapp or Discord!",2
"I like the application very much. In order to respect people's rights, it would be much better to remove this ability to delete two-way chats... or even to edit messages by another person. This feature may seems to be OK , but it can be misused by profiteers! Is there any chance to apply a function in the setting that we can determine whether we allow someone to delete the messages bilaterally or not!.. Thank you 🙏🏻",2
"This is, by far, the best chatting application I've ever used. It's been years since I first used it and still my favorite! I'd like to add a feature that only tagged people can see the message with the slash. For example: /Private only @person1 @person2 can see this message! The slash ""/private"" starts the feature and ""@"" includes those people who can see it! Hope this is helpful and see it featured! Thanks, regards!",2
"I love this app and have used it (and the partner app ""Plus"") for years. With one of the latest updates, however, it's been doing something annoying where when I go to reply to a message, it provides the link above your chat box (like usual), only when you click on the thing you're replying to, it no longer gives you the option to return to that spot in the chat with a click. As I use it to save my place in large chats all the time, this is really inconvenient for me. Would love a fix for this",2
"Broken on older Android devices(4.4.2) as of July 21st update. The constant breaking changes really tarnish the app experience, because otherwise it is a fantastic app. EDIT: They corrected the issue perfectly after about one week and the app is back to good functionality for me. Good job and thanks, Telegram team. EDIT 2: Broken again as of 12/22/23 but fixed within 48 hours!",2
"I've been using telegram for almost 5 years now and man have they came a long way! Absolutely without a doubt the best messaging app there is! Major thanks to Durov and the team for making this app what it is today but most importantly for keeping it free, I'm a premium user because I want to support them but even the free version is amazing! *Someone mentioned they've had an issue getting stuff to download, I've noticed on some devices that you have to have about 3gb of free space to save.",2
"The app works great for me, on my Android phone. I just was dealing with duplicate notifications and didn't realize for a couple days that I apparently had two Telegrams on my phone. I guess when it updates it requires an update from Telegram not the Playstore. Better fix that in the code. Makes it seem like the app isn't trustworthy.",2
"App is great and has all of my friends on it. But recently (being around a month) I have had an experience where I will send a video, but when I click on it to enlarge it, the video doesn't play and there is no sound. A simple reinstall fixed the issue! Thank you much for being an easy app and connecting me with actual people that care about me",2
"I absolutely love this app. Its fast, feature right, and it just works! I do have one wish, however. I would love for the ability to attach a picture to a message *after* Ive already started typing the message out. I constantly start to type my message before attaching the picture, and have to delete the message or cut/paste the text. Every other messaging app I can think of allows this. Please add this functionality!",2
"Such a great app! Smooth experience with regular updates and great free features. I love all the little details, like the ability to edit photos before sending, the cool emojis you can tap for effects that everyone sees real-time, being able to set who can see your profile picture and which picture they see, and themes you can set globally. Also, you have so much control over your account's privacy! Additionally, the app has a pleasing design, good security features, and no ads. ✨",2
"Excellent messaging service. It's pretty easy to get a full messaging experience nowadays (WhatsApp and the like), but Telegram is truly my favorite one. It's loaded with features, and upgrades all the time. My favorite feature is the ability to edit sent messages, to avoid embarrassment. This could be improved by throwing in a edit history that other users could ask permission for or something (to ease minds), but still a great feature. I do miss the typing indicator being in field, but I adapt",2
"Honestly, probably the best messaging app available. Not only is it secure, is filled to the brim with practical functionality! Swiping left to reply to a specific message, choosing to delete from only your end rather than always from both, voice messages, everything about the interface is absolutely beautiful. And I didn't mention it, but the stickers are some of the cutest things I've ever seen. I never thought I'd touch the stickers tab on a messaging app until now, but not with Telegram!",2
"Fantastic secure messaging app. Highly effective UI makes it easy to sort through messages, edit or delete texts, pin or schedule messages, and of course the most important part - THEY HAVE THE BEST STICKERS EVER. Like most people I am stuck using a portfolio of messaging apps for friends who ""only"" use one - this is the one to rule them all for efficiency, features, prioritization of privacy, and ease of use.",2
"Amazing for communication, it has helped me connect with serveral people across the world. May I suggest some quality of life improvements for the app, one, working audio for screen sharing, me and a friend of mine are music producers, and like to show each other what our progress is. it would be convenient to listen while sharing. Also the ability to group chats/ groups. My friend has music groups he is joined in, and it would be nice to have them in a group to seperate personal/business.",2
"My newspaper team uses Telegram to communicate (as a group, and individually) and to send documents & graphic images to each other. My favorite thing about it is that you can go back and fix spelling/wording mistakes after you've sent the messages (tap the message you want to amend and select ""edit""). There aren't ads popping up either. If Telegram had something to share, they send it as a message in their own thread.",2
"This has to be the BEST texting app ever! Not only can you text and see when they read it, but you can send normal files and even mp3 (music) files! They also have thousands of different kinds of stickers to send your friends to show your emotion through a small drawing! When you send links/music/pictures, it keeps track of files like that if you tap on the icon of the person you're texting. This app is the best texting app I've ever had and I really recommend it for couples and friend groups!",2
"Probably the best multi-platform app to stay in touch with all your friends. Amazing experience on Android, iPadOS, and Windows. Love the group and voice chat feature. My friends and I use it exclusively ALL of the time. One bug on iPadOS worth mentioning here too so it can be noticed (also left a review on the App Store) is if I'm in a voice chat and another app plays a sound, my mic stops working and I'm unable to hear my friends until I leave and join the voice chat again.",2
"Anonymous and secure app. It definitely does what it's intended purposes are for. Unfortunately, i am not a fan of the inability to sign in using a computer and sending a code to the app. I tried on a few occasions to see if a code will be sent to my phone instead of through the app but nope. I am now locked out of my account. Besides that inconvenience, it is a very good app to send pics, talk, and text with discretion.",2
"Absolutely perfect messaging experience. I have been using Telegram for many years with friends and family, and I highly recommend to any users looking for 100% free simple, functional, respecting, and secure messaging on every platform (including community supported ones!) or wanting to switch from other similar apps. However, a valid phone number is required for sign up which is a downside for those who might not be as fortunate or trusting, but does help against bad actors/spam.",2
"The best messaging app I've used. Intuitive, great design, very customizable, and has every feature you could want. Syncing is lightning fast, so the ""Saved Messages"" feature even makes a halfway decent AirDrop replacement. Best of all, there are plenty of apps available on any platform you could want. Recommendations: removal of iOS elements (see time selection when scheduling messages), an icon change (adaptive icon's shape within a shape is bad), and 12 hr time in the message scheduler.",2
"It's a great messaging app, and I love the search function. Sometimes I just need to reference a previous conversation or find a recipe or something that was sent to me, and telegram can do that. It's the only app I know that has a good search function, which is very important for me with my memory problems. I also really like that I can edit a sent message if I have a typo or want to add something. It's great!",2
"Im visually impaired, and its great to be able to use TalkBack, and turn it on while youre in the app. You cant do that on me***nge*. If I get a message, and my screen reader is off after clicking on it, I have to exit, turn my screen reader on, then go back to Me***nge*. Also my reader in Me***nge* will not read what the stickers are, but it will in Telegram. Im very appreciative to you guys for that. It makes it a lot easier, especially looking for stickers to send. Font can be enlarged also!",2
"I don't get why people have whatsApp. Telegram has everything you need as a messaging app. Here are a few great positive sides: 1. It is reliable. I never had any issue in last 7 years with sending messages. 2. You don't have to back up your messages, files and etc. 3. High quality Video and voice call without interruption. 4. Ability to send voice and modify its speed 5. You can add a story and live like Instagram And many other cool features. Thank you to every employer of Telegram!",2
"This app is just amazing. There are so many good features. They way that it keeps your record for yeaaaaarssss it is awsome. Transferring your account to a new phone is very easy without losing chats and history. Very powerful cloud. Sending and creating gif, editing pictures, video calls, group chats, and channels are awesome with so many capabilities and authorities that are given to admin. Editind, deleting, pin the msg... I can talk a lot about its features. Just love it.",2
"An excellent app with a very small issue that is very annoying. It would be very good if the developers think about some solution like giving an option to sort. When you see the audios in the chat, let's say it is like A1 A2 A3 But when you play any one of them and it opens in the built in audio player, it is in the reverse order like A3 A2 A1 I need to listen then in the order in which it is sent, but I always have to go back to play the next track, or else it keeps playing in backward order...",2
"""Telegram is by far my favorite messaging app. The interface is clean and easy to navigate, and I love the ability to create large group chats with friends or colleagues. The privacy features, like secret chats with end-to-end encryption, give me peace of mind knowing my conversations are secure. The ability to send files of any type up to 2GB is a game-changer for sharing documents and media. Overall, Telegram is a reliable and versatile messaging platform that I highly recommend to anyone look",2
"Amazing App with endless possibilities. It's super super powerful, but there is definitely scope for improvement. One little suggestion from my side is that you could probably add an option to put custom thumbnails to videos uploaded on a channel or group. Sometimes I upload many videos on a particular channel and when they're not downloaded (so they don't automatically play) I can't recognise which video is which. If there was an option to put thumbnail to u downloaded videos it would be great.",2
"Telegram is really good and so far I'm enjoying it. Only issue is that when I'm downloading a file, it downloaded upto the and then suddenly it says file is not downloading try again. So basically my time and data gest wasted and it gets very frustrating because it consumes lot of data. At Times mid way it stops downloading and restarts. So kindly look into this. Rest is good 😊",2
Thank you for the great experience. Here is a recommendation: a feature for opening multiple chats/groups/channels simultaneously. Somewhat like a split screen. For example I'd like to have two channels open side by side so as to not have to constantly go back and forth.,2
"it has some game changing features, like you can share files of any size no matter how large, it operates as a free unlimited cloud storage, it's more secure than WhatsApp, but 2 stars because I can't register an account on this, I can't receive OTP even though my number is correct. It just keeps loading but never proceeds to the next screen. Kindly fix this issue, this app has a lot potential. UPDATE: The issue got solved when I used USA VPN while registering. no issues now",2
"This is best messaging app.. I have been using it from 4 yrs and I'm satisfied but nowadays I'm facing many problems while using itl .whenever I record video direct from telegram camera it doesn't record or if records it's recorded half or just a little.. and it's annoying to record again n again . The second one is that when I go back in past chats it doesn't show full chats of that date. Hey telegram team , your app is so good but please solve the issues that are making it slow and annoying.",2
"Without premium payment please increase the download speed,if you do that it will be a unique feature than other downloader apps. All users will grateful if you done.please. In addition,Start a system so that when something is downloaded it shows up in the notification. Many times when you download something in Telegram, it closes in the background. It's very annoying.

"Restores deleted contacts, can't remove them. Deleted some contacts long ago. Synchronized contacts on all devices. Can't see them anywhere (in phone contacts, in tablet contacts, in any app). But when I open Telegram THEY ALL ARE THERE. I deleted them in Telegram. I used the option in the Telegram settings to delete all contacts at the server side but when I enable contacts sync again they all are restored anyway. How can you say about privacy if you cant even delete contacts in the app.",2
"U would give 100/100 to this app , best features, best experience, and highly user-friendly. If someone started using this app ; for sure they never gonna end up this 💯.

"Telegram goes far beyond just communication. It is a school on its own. I have been blessed by telegram with very educative channels and groups. Telegram opened my business up to new client bases. Telegram has been a wonderful app for me. I am subscribed to telegram channels that are very useful for me. Channels that post educational content, free courses, software applications, video tutorials etc",2
"Hello, I wanted to ask you to set the order of playing clips or voices in Telegram when they are consecutive, so that instead of playing Z to A, they play A to Z.  That is, in fact, the order of their playback should be such that they are played from first to last, not from last to first, or this option should be such that the user can choose it the way he likes, this way, in my opinion, this part is complete.  thank you",2
The layout is super simplistic that it almost seems as if it's not really an app worth investing your time in. I was about to delete it up until somebody told me that they have the app as well and it's way more than it seems. I've heard rumors this app is shad. Though it's,2
"I love this Application Telegram , it's Amazing full functionality features. In my opinion is the leading chat application in the mobile market. This application full customized, work multiple devices at same time, data management and transferring from IPhone to Android Platform without any problem. Telegram application keep innovativing customization everything time. I thank you Telegram developers",2
"Update April 2024: comments like ""it's been perfect for 5 years but I couldn't login for 30 minutes now. That's why I'm giving it 1 star"". Seriously? Works perfectly for me so far. However, I'd add ""indestructible chats"" as well in case I want to have an important conversation work related and it'd be saved as proof.",2
"The possibility of deleting both sides of the message is a big problem for this software which take away one's privacy and contacts who delete messages on both sides destroy all one's memories, and this is an emotional violation. One of contacts sometimes deletes most of the massages or the page even for me.when I ask why are you doing this says I didn't delete them. So who deletes them, is this a software bug? Please help me to find it or inactivate mutual deleting in telegram. Thanks",2
"It's a perfect app, easy and simple ♡ I can do everything I need to do on it. Talking, chatting, studying, adding stories and posts, having great things like channels, bots, and many ways to reply by react or stickers, I can also select the topic I wanna talk about from the whole message.  And if I wanna change my number, it will be a simple thing, and if I wanna delete the account, I can do it without complications and boring and silly steps.  Big love to Telegram 💞",2

"Telegram app deserves more than 5 stars. The developers did a great job! Kudos. However, I have not been finding it friendly redownloading of my audios and videos that I have downloaded before. Purchasing data is expensive here in Nigeria, locational factor should be considered pls. I could access my downloads before until this very moment when I noticed that Telegram has changed it former approach. Kindly do something about it. Thanks.",2
"The app is great and I use it for everything but there is a recommendation i want share. I know much use telegram as a daily app to write down things and their thoughts and use it often everyday. So I think having an option like to do list or something similar to organize the day, wpuld make it much better. Cause there are much who use telegram as a daily duary tool and would be so useful if there were some option like this. Thank you.",2
"I so much like this APP. One of the reasons being that it accommodates so many contacts and once a new contact is added to your contact lists,it just automatically add that contact to itself",2
"I wanted to bring to your attention a minor issue I've been experiencing with the Telegram app's chat feature. I've noticed that whenever I receive a message, the app displays the ""sender typing"" indicator even though the sender has already sent the message and is not actually typing anymore. It's not a big problem but it does cause some inconvenience and abrupt the flow. Thanks.",2
"After I stopped using Facebook, I switched to this app. It's been about 2 years now, and this app has worked great for me. The ability to send large files is the best feature that I use daily.

This app has everything,like music, movies, information,AI,and even you can talk to someone you know too,and you can even call . It's way better than WhatsApp and it's compatible with each and every device. I can download any of my pictures in chat whenever I want, although I have deleted it. This thing helps me watch any anime I want. This thing is crazy awesome.",2

Please, help provide an alternative way of cancelling it. Thank you as I await your response.",2
"Everything is sooooo cool telegram love forever! But. It seems to me that it’s high time to make the “ALL” folder customizable like other folders; the longer this folder cannot be organized, the more it looks like Stinking garbage dump!I ASK THE DEVELOPERS TO MAKE THE ""ALL"" FOLDER CUSTOMIZABLE LIKE THE REST OF FOLDERS",2

But, video and phone calls always seem to be the weakest feature from them, I always had to use a seperate app for calls and video. Now, however, the new update brought significant improvement on video calls and calls in general. I dare say that they have the best video quality in the market. 5 ⭐. Well done!",2
"It is very good, but there is a bug that I hope will be fixed. That bug is that when we are typing a message and when the Internet or proxy is disconnected and connected, the entire typed message is deleted.But again, thank you for your good program and I hope this bug will be fixed.",2
"The app is an amazing app ,easy to navigate in and connect with friends, families , business and professional groups. Been using it for quite a while now and must say it's features are awesome.Go for it.",2
Telegram should have a notification feature for it's channels where notifications can only be enabled for presence of specific words (selected and seen by me only). I won't have to mute channels after this.,2
"I got a problem when click on Camera button to add a story or when click on attachment icon to attach photo or video (I can say when telegram need to access gallary) the app will freeze, and no matter I force stop or clear catch or even restart the phone, the problem still continues. Android 14 on Galaxy S22 Ultra.",2
this app is soo good i don't know how most people don't use it yet it has so many features that i like lately the download speeds have gotten slower and you need premium for better speeds but i get it that they need people to but premium as they need money overall great experience i also found so many pirated movies and series here,2
I have just one suggestion. Even though I have already given 5 stars but I think Telegram developers should add a feature of putting password protection on viewing the Archived messages. What's the point in hiding something when any other person could just swipe down to view your archived message. 🤷🏻,2
"""As a Telegram user, I'm impressed by its seamless messaging experience. The app's security features, fast performance, and customizable settings make it a standout choice. The cloud-based approach ensures I can access my messages across devices hassle-free. The commitment to end-to-end encryption adds an extra layer of privacy that I value. Overall, a top-notch messaging app that I highly recommend.""",2
"It's a great app. I have enjoyed 2 years of using it. However, there have been several bugs every time. For example, whenever somebody deletes a music that I have sent to a group, the music file gets deleted from my phone, too. Moreover, I have no access to videos, photos, music files, and all documents in my phone's file manager. This has been challenging for me since I can not save my favourite files and delete others.",2
"Telegram is far better than Whats hands down. It's all online. You can literally throw your phone away, but a new one, install Telegram and it's all there. No backup needed.",2
"The seamless integration between the mobile and web apps is just so beautiful. I could be typing something in the mobile app, and decide to continue from where I stopped on the web app. The cloud storage capacity is in fact my favorite feature. It's literally become my backup drive. Then there is the privacy and security offerings that is at least a millennium ahead of it's contemporaries including WhatsApp messenger. Telegram is the best thing that ever happened to instant-messaging",2
"5 star is not enough for Telegram! have been using it for more than a decade now and it keeps surprizing me and my friends how much an app ehich is already good, can improve. I'm a software engineer myself and I give cudos to the developers and designers at Telegram. everything is intuitive, beautiful, and just works the way you want it to. You have control over everything yet not overwhelming. And the cherry on top are the new stickers that are added regularly. Nice job 👏🏻",2
"Telegram is the best social media and messaging app in the world.very fast ,very secure , stable , very very useful for sending and reseiving data ,files and .... channels in many languages , best news channels,creating groups ability .it works very good in limited countries with most filtering with its own proxies .I can say more and more about telegram .Thank you so much Povel Du Rove.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏",2
I love this app but the latest update has A HUGE bug! Some video messages go to the music category and they play whilst listening to music! And you can't skip them! Like imagine listening to music on shuffle then suddenly hearing your own voice. So annoying. My main use of telegram was listening to music now it's ruined. Please fix this. Many of my friends have this problem as well. /// The problem has been solved. Thank you telegram team❤️,2
"I'm impressed with this app. It's incredibly smooth and fast, making it the best messenger app I've used. In fact, I'd say it's even better than WhatsApp. What's great is that it's compatible with various devices like Windows, iPad, and mobile, making communication easy and accessible. Plus, the app takes privacy seriously with no tracking or hidden elements, ensuring the best privacy experience.😍",2
"This app has truly simplified my daily routine and made life so much more organized – a definite game-changer I have been using this app for a while now, and it's become an indispensable part of my daily life. Its intuitive interface and seamless functionality have made everything from organizing tasks to managing schedules an absolute breeze. This app's ability to streamline my routine and keep me on track has been a game-changer, giving me the freedom to focus on what truly matters.",2
So much stuff to find or look at. I was wondering having problems with cashed data it's constantly high have to constantly clean it. And how do I stop photos going to my Google photos account. Ive lost couple emails because of it. What is posted on there should stay there.,2
"I like Telegram & I appreciate all the upgrades. Yes, there is a but... I updated it just this morning & now it's not even opening. I get a notification when msgs come through only. Developers help please 😕",2
telegram is my fav application from last 1 year. the features it has are totally unique not like other applications whom are copying each other's features. Every update of telegram brings something totally new among all messaging applications. best application I have in my phone. thanks.,2
"Telegram is a game-changer in messaging apps. Its user-friendly interface, robust security features, and seamless synchronization across devices make communication effortless. The array of customizable features, like stickers, GIFs, and versatile chat options, add fun and convenience to conversations. Moreover, the commitment to privacy with end-to-end encryption ensures peace of mind while connecting with friends, family, or colleagues.",2
"Telegram is a popular messaging app known for its encryption, privacy-focused features, and user-friendly interface. Many users appreciate its fast performance, wide array of features, and its ability to support large group chats. However, some users have reported occasional issues with message syncing and the app's reliability on some devices. It's always a good idea to do thorough research and read multiple user reviews before making decisions about which apps to use.",2
"This is one of my favourite apps but there are a couple of issues that keep it 4★: (1) it insists on forever creating folders on my phone full of images I've sent in chat weeks ago and there's no way to disable this autodownload nonsense that I have to constantly clean up; (2) why do ""Music"" files not have a way to turn off looping autoplay? ""Voice"" files don't do this but ""Music"" files do? I've been near deafened too many times by it autoplaying a loud track.",2

"""Open in External Browser"" has been broken for quite some time now. Everyone has a browser of choice already set... Hint: it isn't FB's browser! 🤨 Fix it and I'll consider upping my review score. Another annoying issue is the auto-refresh function. If I; or others, wish to refresh the screen then we'll do just that. And of course, it inevitably happens in the middle of reading a post. Completely unnecessary function and not needed whatsoever.",0
"It's worked in the past, but for the last few days (an update, perhaps?) when my phone is folded there's an ugly bar on the left side that blocks the content on my feed. When I unfold it, the screen keeps flickering and jittering and it can't be interacted with. I've tried uninstslling and reinstalling, didn't help. Maybe it's a feature.",0
"Completely unusable with my Z fold 4. First issue is that in folded mode, it now keeps the same layout of unfolded mode. Can't see half of the posts and it looks awful. After using it this way for a bit, eventually the ui elements overlap and I can't click anything. Second issue(which I realize is a ""feature"" is that when I click on messenger while unfolded, it splits the screen. Sounds like a good idea, but it looks horrible. If I wanted to split the apps, I would do it myself.",0
"I do not like the automatic sound on media. I have the setting turned off. After an update, the feature isn't working correctly. I used to click on a reel and the volume would stay off after I scrolled through my newsfeed. Now, the volume is on. I know I can turn off the volume by the little speaker in the video. That's not the point. My setting reflects that it's off. There have been two updates and this is still occurring. It's annoying.",0
"Not folding device friendly. Opens in tablet mode on the small screen so the side bar takes up half the screen. You have to switch screens back and forth to get the bar to the top, but then all media becomes oversized and cropped off. Also, refreshes the app every time you switch screens so you will lose your place. Frequently brings up month old posts. Also, snoozing is pointless because once the month ends, they shove everything you specifically wanted to avoid right into your face.",0
"Got rid of og videos - now only reels, which no one wants. Usually on FB 8+ hrs/day. I cant use as is. Everyone wants the regular videos as well as the reels. Most of us watch the videos with subtitles, at dif speed options, full screen, etc that reels does not provide. Reels also doesn't show like videos. If I'm watching a rug cleaning video at 2 am I don't want a video about domestic violence. I want more satisfying videos like more rug cleaning videos. Just have both. No one wants this.",0
Galaxy Fold 4 here and the app is awful now on the front screen with the navigation bar on the left side of the screen taking up almost half of it. Hard to see anything and it usually glitches again and you can't even select any of the options. Been this way for almost a month now and not a fix in sight. Uninstalling and installing it again gives you maybe a few minutes or an hour until it goes right back.,0
"Ever since the recent update, the layout changed on the Z fold and it smashes everything together so that the different menu buttons can be on the left instead of on top. It's become pretty much unusable on the outer screen and you frequently have to clear all the data and never close the app to get a short term fix that doesn't always work.",0
"No longer really usable on my phone, since after OS update today the navigation bar takes up a huge amount of the left side of my screen, making it so I can't even read or see pictures conveniently. Nice break. Oh and then also the navigation bar occasionally shrinks to be so small that it can't be cooked on effectively. So it's either way too big, or it's way too small. Genius. Galaxy Z-Fold 4, outside screen.",0
"I have the Z Fold 4... I guess I won't be on Fbook much... can't read anything on the outside screen and I don't usually use the inside screen other than for emails, spreadsheets and movies... not.. facebook... I can't read MOST of what I see when loaded up... worst setup ever..... give us the option to go back to the last version! This one is VERY TERRIBLE..",0
"As if fb wasn't bad enough, they pushed out a forced change moving the navigation bar to the left side of the device. No accessibility options to change this. This renders the app extremely difficult to use on Samsung fold or flip phones as they are skinnier and taller than most phones, causing the amount of usable screen to be diminished even further. In a world of vertical smartphones, some yahoo thought it was a good idea to put the navigation bar on the longest side, shrinking visible space.",0
"The newest update moved the navigation bar to the left-side of the screen, which is the absolute WORST place for it. It fit across the top with little interference with the rest of my screen. Now, its taking up space from my news feed and I can't read or see posts, I have to click on every single post to see it. Uninstalling this garbage now.",0
"I am not inherently against AI, but the way AI has been newly integrated into this app, without a way to disable it (so that they can collect data to teach their language model) is not something I can get behind. Along with the fact they state how much our privacy matters to the company, but yet you have to go through layers & layers of settings to adjust the privacy settings (& some settings don't really allow you to opt out of data that is shared) & then it doesn't seem to make a difference.",0
Today it gets one star.... please remove the recent update that makes it impossible to use Facebook on the fold phones. The layout was perfectly fine the way it was. I don't understand why you would go and put the settings and notifications bar on the left side of the screen and it also appears to have changed what I'm actually seeing instead of just seeing my feed. I can't even see anything to try and navigate through the app,0
"I don't know what facebook did, but I can't stand it anymore. I won't bother using it. The UI had changed and is terrible with navigation on the side. Sometimes it's up in the top somewhere where you have no access. Good luck changing figuring it out yo change it. I get tons of ads or videos that have nothing to do with me. Languages I don't speak. What good is that for me. I put ""not interested"" and whatever I can think of to curb what Meta thinks I want, but it's AI is an idiot. I could go on.",0
"Notifications don't come through until hours later. It's usually 2 hours or more before I see a post from my boss in a group for my 2nd job. The ratio between suggested pages and posts from my actual friends is 70/30 at this point. It's too much. The current layout is a jumbled, glitchy mess. The previous layout was totally fine, but now everything is too small because the navigation bar is on the side. App still hasn't been optimized for folding devices, as I have the Z Fold 4.",0
"I have a z fold 4, and my facebook app updated today. It now has all the tabs on the left side of my screen, and the feed to the right of it. Everything is cut off, and it doesn't fit. The tabs shrink up to the point of not being able to press any of them, much less even know what they are. This is an awful, awful, AWFUL update! Please fix it!",0
"I really hope Facebook sees this because I'm at a loss for how else to get the issue fixed. Facebook's newest update has made the app unusable for Galaxy Fold phones. It switches the notification tab from the top of the screen to the side, smooshing all the posts. Even worse, when you scroll, you lose access to the notification tab altogether, leaving white space. I have to close out the app because I'm unable to access messenger or refresh. I've switched to using Chrome to access the site.",0
"No way to turn off all the garbage they throw at you. Good luck finding any of the stuff your friends post. Update: Still mostly ads and garbage. Still don't see anything from the people I actually know. Also, everything is smashed and doesn't fit on the phone screen with the notification bar on the side now for some reason... Massive failure of an app.",0
This latest update has made it unusable. I don't know if this is across all devices but on a Samsung Galaxy Fold 4 you can't access the side panel. Your feed is super cramped when using the front screen. It's awful. It seems like what was intended for when the middle screen is folded out and being used is now on the front screen and that's what makes it unusable.,0
"Update: This app has become clickbait only. Unless you were to go into the ""Feeds"" option under your profile, then all you're seeing is ""suggested for you"" clickbait with AI images, bots, and low quality content. Toggling the news feed options has not helped one bit. Marketplace has improved Original: Marketplace is poorly designed. I want the items that are actually locally for sale, instead of online listings and random ads. It is hard to find anything without specifically searching for it.",0
"Every update they make, the app gets worse. The notification disappear while scrolling. Why? Because they want to svae you 3% of your screen real estate I guess. Totally dumb and useless. Notifications don't appear properly anymore, you have to click a button to see additional notifications. FB just seems to be regressing. No wonder the platform is dying.",0
AWFUL!!! 😔 I don't know what upgrade happened within the last two weeks but my Samsung Galaxy fold does not work properly! Absolutely positively utterly disgusted!! I do not want my navigation bar on the left I'll squashed up so I can't read anything! I want it back on the top of the page...so fix it!! IMMEDIATELY!!! TERRIBLE!!!😡😡😡,0
It's been a year since my last review. Nothing has changed. Facebook app is broken. They've refused to fix it. Every second item on your feed is a Spam ad that can never be removed or blocked. The three dot Function menu does nothing. And trying to even block a single ad. Will crash the app. Or it will lock the app or cause functional errors that disable using it without a complete restart of your entire phone.,0
"The latest update performed rendered my mobile app almost unusable on the Fold 4. The Shortcut bar moved from the top of the screen to the left side of the screen, causing it to take up 60% of the News Feed. Not to mention that when you click on a shortcut, they all colapse on top of each other causing you to have to quit the app and return.",0
"The installation of the Meta AI on the search bar makes the app nearly useless for finding people or events because it opens up a text thread with AI instead of giving you what you asked for. I've been trying to remove it, but all the instructions I've found online don't seem to work on my phone. This could be the final nail in the coffin for my use of this app.",0
"The recent app update is absolutely horrendous. The left side is now dominated by the menu bar, squishing the content I actually want to see into a much smaller space. So much space is wasted in the lower left. Why in the world was this change made? The menu bar was perfectly fine at the top. The app now looks awful. Please change it back.",0
Z Fold 5 user here. Opened the app today and found that the navigation bar has been moved to the left side of the screen when using the front screen (I almost always use the front screen while scrolling FB). This change makes the app completely unusable on my front screen due to the bar taking up about a quarter of my real estate. And I can't seem to find any setting to move the bar back to the top. Ridiculous,0
"I have a z fold samsung and all was ok till a week or so ago,now facebook is total trash unless you jump through hoops to make it work. The problem is the navigation bar moved to the left and all the articles are jumbled to the right. You can of course log out and back in in hopes it works or open the z foldto full screenthen close it to use the front screen. I as well as others are getting frustrated with this.",0
"Originally, one stared for all the ads but had to delete the review to bow complain about the app not being usable. I can't even read things on the screen anymore. They moved the slectuon bar from the top to the left. At the top, it took up 1/12th of the screen, but the new one takes up 1/5 of the screen. I have a giant black bar on the left side of my screen now, and I am not exaggerating. Using my calipers, my screen is approximately 55mm across, with the left bar being approximately 11mm.",0
"What's going on with Facebook? Whatever it is it's pissing me off! I've never had an issue with the Facebook til a few days ago when it started acting up. Anytime I try 2 open up the app 2 login it kicks me back out & it does it over & over again.I haven't been able 2 login for 4 days now. I've tried everything from forcing it 2 stop,2 reloading it,2 uninstalling it & then reinstalling. Nothing seems 2 be working. Someone PLEASE HELP ME !!! ASAP!!!!",0
"I've withstood all the random changes/updates over the years, but their Meta AI might just be the update that pushes me to delete my account. It's intrusive, at least its placement is, and it should be placed in a non-central area not right at the search bar. For users, generally older ones, who are not computer savvy, their placement of it isn't fair as they wouldn't readily figure out that Meta AI is not the same as the Search function so it seems predatory by Facebook to do this.",0
"I am not happy with the latest update. I don't like that my navigation bar was moved to the left side of my screen, and there is no option to move it back to the top. Also, when I click on the hamburger menu bars, it automatically shrinks down to one squished little symbol, kind of like all the pinned shortcuts are squished into one. I hope this gets fixed / changed so we have the option to move it back to the top.",0
"Reels are basically unmoderated and awful. They start showing you animal abuse disguised as ""saving"" animals. No matter how many times you select ""show less"" it never learns. Hiding a reel also does nothing as it will just show back up again once you refresh the page. Also you can't block Instagram users in the reels that show up in Facebook for some reason.",0
"What a horrible app to have to work with. Creating posts and events as a business is such an unintuitive and cumbersome process. There is no way to view upcoming events in a calendar format. I am constantly bombarded with suggestions to ""boost"" my posts and advertisement suggestions. The only saving grace is the ability to edit and schedule posts on the ""Meta Business Suite"" (separate app), but I can't do anything with events in the suite.",0
"For whatever reason people can't share links to videos in either Facebook or Instagram with me that work. The app and device are both running the latest updates, the device is also updated, and this issue has lasted for three app updates at this point. A tech savvy friend said something about it not updating and instead pulling a cache version...I don't know about any of this but for them to not be able to fix it in so many updates is beyond annoying. ""The page you requested was not found.""",0
"I was in a library looking through Facebook marketplace and an advertisement took over my phone. It started blaring over my phone speakers, so I pressed the volume down button, and it got louder. Then I switched to another app, and it kept blaring. I pressed the button to shut the screen off and it kept blaring. I had to run out of the library and restart my phone to get it to shut the hell up. Way to go Facebook 🤬",0
"Video viewing is a horrendous experience on Facebook. They removed the scrub bar, so you can't go forward or rewind. Sometimes if you pause a video, it will restart at the beginning when you press play. Some videos will just pause randomly and either resume playing after skipping ahead, or just refuse to play past a certain point. Some videos will make you watch 1 or 2 ads in the middle, even if the video is only 30 seconds long. You can't even see comments without being redirected to Instagram.",0
"Completely out of touch. Constantly switching on options you turned off (like starting videos with sound). Every time they add a new feature it becomes progressively worse, more counter-intuitive and . Popularity algorithms are a horrible idea. Was much better when posts remained chronological as I'm now repeatedly seeing the same fortnight-old posts on my feed. The ONLY reason I use this app is due to the popularity and the DM function. If I had a choice, I would have left a decade ago.",0
"I don't know what happened lately, but the performance of the application is giving a subpar experience to the point I'm considering uninstalling it. Also, my like icons are gone, and sometimes even the option to do a like is gone. Videos are also a terrible experience. They work like reels, which is horrible for longer videos, and having the video play over and over again while reading the comments just kills it for me. Is interesting seeing this many issues from such a big company.",0
Every time I go to my home screen and then click back on the app it opens a new version of the app resulting in multiple versions of the same app running at the same time. This results in more data and battery power usage. This has been happening for a few years now across multiple different samsung devices. Tried removing and reinstalling multiple times with no help.,0
"I've been having a persistent issue involving reels - specifically, reels that are sent to me via Messenger. After clicking on a sent reel and being redirected to the Facebook app, I am met with a gray screen and text on the bottom reading ""Comments are disabled."" In other words, the reels don't even load for me. This is frustrating because I am able to view reels while on the app and send them to friends, but I only have problems when one is sent to me and I cannot view it due to the error.",0
"External Browser Settings Disabled Yet Again! Nearly a decade later, here we are again. The setting to open links in the external browser by default simply doesn't work anymore. So now you have to go through additional steps on every single link you tap. Every so often Facebook does this, trying to force users to use their garbage internal browser. 1 star forever until fixed again.",0
"Buggy, developer not terribly responsive. I've been complaining about buggy settings like the external browser setting for months now and it's still opening links in their data thieving browser. Video playback continues to be an issue where some links clicked on just loop the first couple of seconds rather than playing. Logging trouble tickets is a waste of time",0
"Facebook took away the news feed, they're forcing random pages you don't follow onto your feed while reducing the posts of people you're actually friends with, and the quality of videos being recommended is absolute trash. It seems to be flooded with staged, obviously fake videos with no depth cranked out just to try to get views. Very little quality content anymore. I'm thinking about moving on from Facebook more and more each day.",0
"Can no longer view in landscape screen - so annoying. Also, it constantly resets my privacy settings. I just noticed that the fb messenger reset to show when I'm active -again. I didn't change it. I've been checking it periodically bc it has done it 2x now. It keeps saying I have a message when there is not. I wish it didn't show all your ""friends"" everything you do. So annoying and it's getting boring w so many ads.",0
"Review of FB Dating: First, I got multiple errors when trying to save profile details. The app will also not upload photos from your saved albums, just gallery, camera roll and screenshots. It also crashed/froze three times while swiping. If you swipe, button inputs will stop working. On top of that, 90% of the people I see are over 100 miles away and I live in a major city! All in all, it's a broken, under baked feature that feels like an afterthought instead of a standalone dating app.",0
"It was fine at first. But now that I can't remove the app from my phone, and they have a new AI system that isn't very subtle about it accessing things beyond its limits, (contacts, payment information, location history, Google account information for all accounts associated with yours, and even bank account information, etc.) I am very concerned with my safety. Facebook, stop it.",0
"Ever since a recent update about a week ago, every time I relaunch the app after closing it while in tablet mode on my ZFold 4 the app constantly refreshes. The only workaround has been to launch the app first on the outer display, then open it to tablet mode, otherwise it starts refreshing again. I've reinstalled the app multiple times, cleared cache and app data, and still it happens over and over.",0
"Facebook is literally trash now! When it was first created it was a pretty good thing. They have only turned it sour!!!!! For instance....there is no person to talk to or chat with in the ""help center"" only more pages of stuff to click and skim through to only find out your problem is not in the list of problems....leaving you stuck and frustrated!",0
On the Samsung Fold now sucks. On the folded side with app open it moved the navigation bar to the left side it takes up most of the screen space. When the phone is unfolded and you try to use the app it just flickers and you can not use the app. Things were better before this most recent update.,0
"The latest update ruined my layout on my Galaxy Z Fold. If im using my front screen, my layout is along the right side of the screen rather than the top, and certain options dont appear anywhere because they dont fit that way. If i go to my profile then click back to my feed, the options on the right hand side all scrunch up at the very top, one on top of the other. Absolutely horrible. What the hell is with this app lately?",0
"noticed a lot of recent reviews are having similar issues to mine. The app has been constantly glitching for weeks now and is extremely slow, and won't show like button options anymore. they're just empty gray bubbles. It is getting to the point where I'm about to stop using it altogether. Is there something going on? It seems multiple people are reporting a similar issue.",0
I have FB for marketplace only. When I take pictures of stuff to sell the pictures come out great. Then once I post them to marketplace the colors get distorted. This is super frustrating and it's making it almost impossible for me to sell anything. I've had other issues that were happening prior but those never affected the quality of my post. I'm not sure what is going on FACEBOOK but this needs to be resolved!,0
"I've been using the app for years, but I was hacked and made a double verification to help make my account more secure. Never do the double verification where you need to use a second verification app to log in. My phone factory reset, and I lost the verification app, which is now preventing me from logging back in. If your phone dies or freezes, be warned: you will lose access to your profile. Contactted Facebook several times, and there has been no response.",0
"This mornings update ruined the app. My Z fold 4 already has a narrow front screen, and moving the icons to the left side of the screen made all off the feed so skinny its almost impossible to read. It was much better when they were tucked away in the top of the screen, but still easily accessible.",0
"Really buggy lately. It constantly crashes, if I share something like a YouTube video I get a constant ""lost connection to Internet"" popup until I open the app and THEN it will sharehe post just fine, zero links to outside sources work and when you tap them the screen slides sideways to open the link and then immediately slides back. I haven't even been able to post to the groups I'm in, when I hit create post in a group I get a darkened tint over the screen with no option but to hit the X.",0
"No idea what happened, but my photos disappear as soon as I upload them. The new album is there and shows however many number of photos there are, but the photos aren't showing up. They've completely disappeared from my timeline and do not show up on the tagged person's page either. This is extremely frustrating, and I haven't been able to get any help from anyone. For the few seconds they're there, when clicked on by someone else, it says there was a problem. I hope this is resolved quickly.",0
"Continuously tries to change the way I think and only shows OBE news unless I actively hunt for new and up to date information. Even then, it ain't easy. I'm not gonna start on the amount of spammers that are allowed to exist here. If it wasn't for communicating with family and friends long distance, then I would've disappeared from this app years ago",0
"I have encountered a persistent issue when attempting to access my Facebook account. Despite numerous attempts to sign in, I am consistently met with an ""unexpected error"" or ""session timed out"" message. This prevents me from regaining access to my account. I have taken several troubleshooting steps, including uninstalling and reinstalling the Facebook app, utilizing a web browser, and attempting to reset my password, though I am certain of its accuracy.",0
"The layout, rules change faster than I can keep up with. No privacy. Easily hacked and they're data miners. I wish there were an alternative but they have a monopoly on social media. Photos are downsized in resolution without your permission. No control for the user. My ID was stolen probably from having this mobile app. I had to make a new ID. Some stranger has taken ownership, use my profile pic, my of my photos!! Complained to FB countless times but no reply!! Unbelievable!! Danger!!",0
"Fix your worthless app and fire your worthless devs. The gallery will no longer display more than the 30 oldest photos/videos in any album. No matter how much you try to scroll, anything newer then the first 30 are completely inaccessible. An example, I go to look and change my profile picture. My profile pic album has 100 photos in it, but the only ones I'm allowed to see or select are back from 2014 to 2016.",0
Update: the new AI thing that replaced the search button is really annoying. You can add something without taking something else away or making it worse. The back button on my phone no longer works on Facebook so I specifically have to press the back arrow button in the top left corner. This sucks and is bad design.,0
New update ruined the app. It has now become a left-handed app 85% of the world is right handed and the bars on the side instead of the top now and when you switch between some screens they just completely disappear and become garbled up. If you don't have a very wide screen then it destroys almost all your usable screen come on now guys do you even use your app on different phones besides the newest largest iPhone 75% of the planet is using an Android phone. Make the bar a drop down.,0
"I enjoy the convenience of Facebook, however you are constantly having to change your settings after every update. The app is extremely pushy in changing your settings and trying to force downloads, settings you have no interest in and saving items. Messenger isn't much better by trying to get you to add multiple accounts. personally I'm getting tired of having to constantly change my settings and decline new services on an hourly basis. stop being so pushy, if I want something I will add it.",0
"Seriously HATE this app right now! Cannot see reactions - they're just gray little circles. Videos are skipping if working at all. Scrolling is a complete joke as it's more like the screen stays still and then maybe moves a slight centimeter or it quickly flies past dozens of posts at a time. Mostly it's jerky & hardly moves. Typing goes farther than what shows up whether there's a character limit or not. Uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted phone. Zero fix from many many reports sent. ZERO stars",0
"Videos keep switching to use the Reel player instead of the usual video player. I hate the reel player, especially for videos. There are buttons that appear on top of the video that cannot be hidden, and it repeats the same video instead of serving up another video on the same show. Why can't you fix this so that the reel player is only used for the short dumb TikTok like clips and leave the longer videos alone?! I'm sick of this happening!",0
"The ads are getting out of control. When there are 20 ads/suggested posts in a row without a single post from a friend, that is ridiculous! And that is not a fluke, it is pretty average & normal to have to scroll past that many to see actual posts of people I know. Also, within the last few months it will not allow my phone to auto rotate to landscape for any pictures or to live stream. It only seems to be some phones (almost exclusively Android) and I have found no solutions to fix it.",0
"For the last month, all videos are opening in the "" reel"" format, and it's frustrating! I've done all the tech support things like clearing cache, uninstalling, and reinstall etc and nothing has helped. I've emailed multiple emails for Facebook as there is no longer support on the app. The support tab now is all just articles they wrote, so you can't get help anymore. This is ridiculous.",0
"Still only deserving of 1 star. Now, cannot view videos in feed. Directed to other sections of Facebook when I hit 'play'. Cleared cache, up to date on version, restarted phone, logged out and back in to app, nothing works. Never mind all I ever see in my feed are sponsored and suggested pages that I have absolutely no interest in. I see more unwanted content than friends and family's posts. Oh... and I'm still waiting for that Facebook avatar!",0
"New version is terrible. The app logs me out automatically, sometimes multiple times in a row and I can't access my own account. There is no virus on my phone or issues with any other apps. This happens multiple times a day Update 3/5/2024 My account keeps logging me out and I don't remember the passwords. I was able to log in literally 20 minutes ago and for some reason it logged me out of both. No emails or explanations.",0
"I decided to update my preferences in books, music and so on. Well, the music section is useless. The ""help"" pages show things I don't have on my page, like the 3 little bars in the corner. When I go to the edit section, nothing happens. Another waste of time. All I wanted to do was something simple, yet FB manages to complicate it. Somehow I'm not surprised as they've never replied in the past to help with an actual SOLUTION!! I just got ran around and robots. WASTE",0
"For the past week or so, the screen keeps jumping when I open the app. It also happens when I switch between tabs and when I switch between accounts. The app is nearly impossible for me to use now. Also, I can't sign into Messenger on my account that's connected to my main account. It either tells me that an unexpected error occurred or to try again later. Now I'm stuck using Messenger in the Facebook app for that account. Please fix your apps, Meta!",0
It's great but I see a lot of stuff that isn't from my friends. Actually get more reels and suggest stuff than anything. And now in marketplace sort and filter does no good cuz it still shows stuff I don't want that's too far away or not in the price range. Edit: can't even sort bc it says no results. Go back to suggested and tons of results in my search,0
"Website is fine, app worked just fine til a week or so ago and now it's nonfunctional. I have un and reinstalled it several times and it'll load up for a few seconds but before I can do anything substantial, it brings up a ""something went wrong"" screen with a retry button that loads for a second but does nothing. I cannot use the app at all and I don't believe their support team has emailed me back. My account is still fine when I go through a desktop browser.",0
"It has been an astonishing tool of connectivity. However, its totalitarian behavior and obvious political bias have made it an insufferable experience. Now, it's loaded with ads that I don't want to see, and the 'show less' option doesn't do a damn thing. Would glady leave this platform if only there were something to replace it with.",0
"3/6/24: why are you forcing me to open links in your browser? You already do this for IG. The setting to open links in external browser isn't working. Fix please. What is up with notifications? I don't get them even if I ask to be notified of a post. And then when I go to the notifications, it just gives me a blank loading page. Same thing happens when I go to random pages. I have to keep reinstalling it. Please fix this.",0
"Facebook started off as a good platform to keep in touch with friends, especially those living in other states and countries. It has evolved into the user being overwhelmed with ads and content that has nothing to do with the user and worse, there is no way to block, or remove that content. Think of it as watching a 30 minute TV show with 25 minutes of ads. Facebook developer's have totally runied the original concept of a ""social platform"". Shame on them!",0
"Marketplace doesn't follow your search parameters (results hundreds of miles outside search area), notifications don't come through, comment sections don't scroll anymore, loading times for everything are excessive, videos don't autoplay anymore, there's 3 add videos for every one video, reels are super annoying and there's no way to remove the option of them or get past them. Most recent updates (within 6-8 months) have made the app extremely tedious and painful to use.",0
"This app sucks! It literally does not work. I went to switch between messenger and fb and it just loaded.....then I refreshed the app and still just loading....When I went to search a name in fb it just doesn't even load....worse app I've ever used. You can't even use it because it doesn't even load!!!! Many problems every time I use it - so slow, won't load, when you go to your friends list it just glitches out and sends you the too every time so you can't even look a friends at the bottom.",0
"Currently can't login with correct credentials. After being logged out overnight, logged in and was immediately presented with prompt saying 'session expired'. I tried again--same result. Uninstalled, reinstalled--got stuck on login screen. AGAIN uninstalled, reinstalled--same result. I've been getting glitches/errors in the app (and reporting them) for the past couple weeks and they seemed to be increasing. The worst part about it is that there is no feedback of any kind from developers... ...",0
"There must have been a recent update, because now all of my ""like"" options have disappeared just showing white circles. I can't react to anything other than a simple ""like"" and I can't see what other people have reacted. And the screen is lagging like crazy. I thought it was fixed last night, it was perfectly fine. But now it's back to the white circles and lagging. That coupled with the constant onslaught of ads is just making me stay off Facebook.",0
"The option to have links open in external browser doesn't work. It used to work, but hasn't for the last few weeks. This wouldn't be a big deal if the built-in browser was any good, but it's horrible. Notifications are also spotty. Sometimes I'll get them a day or two, sometime more, after the comment, reaction, etc was made. Sometimes I won't get any notification. It's also tedious to have to select ""all comments"" instead of ""most relevant"". ""All comments"" should be the default.",0
"Can't share the music that I want anymore on my story. It was bad enough that despite Instagram being owned by Facebook, Instagram didn't have all the copyright privileges that Facebook had, and so it would simply not post or would mute my story on Instagram when it transferred over. I thought it couldn't get any worse. Now the music search section is completely broken, and doesn't look up the songs that I search. Clicking on the artist's name brings up an empty page. Why this all of a sudden?",0
"The screen flashes black while I'm in the app. Never happens anywhere else. Everything is updated, my phone is brand new. Just flashes black and then returns. Always and only in Facebook app. What the hell did you guys do? Everything was fine before it turned into Meta or whatever the hell it is now EDIT. it now freezes whenever I try to open any external pages at all. My entire phone shuts off and the app itself always tells me it stopped and needs to shut down. Ridiculous",0
Got caught in a session expired loop with an up to date app and phone software. Literally no reason to continue to refuse me access to my account I've had for more than a decade. As soon as I log in I get a session expired message. It's done this 6 times this morning. I even Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Didn't help. I wouldn't be so bent out of shape if some of the last messages from my dead father weren't on that account. Do better.,0
"Terrible UI/UX design. There is no way that any developer work a grain of salt would be okay with releasing garbage like this. If I save a video, I don't want to watch that short from the exact second I left off. This isn't Netflix, these are 15-30 second videos, and you're so bad at your job, you can't figure out how to make them restart, so they just replay from the same middle area, every time. Go get a real job.",0
"My Facebook said it needed to update. I don't normally have problems with Facebook updating so I did update it. Now, I'm having trouble even getting the app to open! And when it does finally open, I can't see my news feed, or my notifications, or anything! Great! Now I can't even scroll through my groups anymore! What the heck, Facebook? I'm about ready to delete this app",0
"It has been horrible. Random logout. When I tried to reset the password and double verification, it failed, and then I was locked out, so I had to create a second account. Now, the second account, I can't even log in with double verification setup. I guess it's time to move on and dump for good. Customers service sucks.",0
"Latest version opens all hyperlinks in its internal browser, even when you have it checked in the settings to NOT do this. Not that it matters much any. Good luck finding posts from your actual friends and groups. Nine out of every ten posts are ads or suggestions. Eventually you might be able to keep up with people you know.",0
"Ever since the outage on 3/5/24, I'm constantly getting a session expired pop up on my mobile app. The app just updated today. The whole site as a whole has honestly been trash for a while now. When I first signed up, I was able to see other pages that I liked and friends that was friends with now I have to constantly go to each page or profile. Everything on my newsfeed is everything I do NOT want to see. My customers and friends can't see my stuff. Feels like I'm just talking to myself. 😡",0
Well FB app decided to expire my log in to both my accounts. When I entered the passwords to either one FB said they were wrong . So I try the forgot password and get a link sent to me via email and enter it the app does nothing . What's up with this 💩 . Now i can't login to either of my accounts. The FB screens have been Jerky as well for some reason. FB yall are having some serious issues. FIX IT !!!!,0
"I have Videos Start with Sound turned Off. I have Open Links in External Browser turned On. Facebook still opens all web links on Facebook trying to sneak at my passwords for Amazon, rather than open my external browser which is set a default browser on my phone, and it still starts all my videos with sound, which is annoying when I'm looking at Facebook in public and a loud video triggers just by scrolling down. Why even offer those two choices, if you're not going to abide by them?",0
UPDATE 2/26/24 Facebook doesn't care about their dumb app I guess. The notifications still don't work. I don't get the ones that are supposed to appear at the top of my phone screen so I have to look at it more often and the birthday ones don't work period. I have tried clearing the cache and Uninstaller it and reinstalling it and nope nothing works.,0
"Whenever going to messenger and then trying to go back to the app., it just kicks me back to my home screen. Clicking on the Facebook app again just takes me to messenger. I have to completely close out of the app. and refresh each time this happens to be able to get Facebook up again. I've cleared caches and everything, it still hasn't fixed the issue. They need to fix this bug.",0
"I despise this app and website and everything about it. Every time I use it something catastrophic happens, 1st thing that happened was my account got hacked and Facebook told me to contact the person who took my password if I wanted to get it back. I love losing 20 years of memories. I made a new account reconnected with everybody, then it logged me out and while trying to reset my password I encountered so many unexpected errors they should be considered expected. Glad I never liked it.",0
"I'm frustrated at the fact it's been over 2 months and videos still are NOT playing right. All of the videos I watch are in the reel format. If I search for a video and click it; it will play in the right format. If I try to go back to search and play another video there will be the phrase "" null in video"" in the video search bar. Fix this facebook I've tried everything and emailed plenty of times. How do you not know this is a problem by now?",0
"The app has been really acting up lately. It's jumpy and the reaction emojis don't show up any more. I often only see old posts in my newsfeed, even ones that are several days old and that I've already seen on other devices. I updated the app a few days ago and that helped for about a day and now all the same issues are back. I checked for another update and there isn't one available.",0
"Account got hacked, someone changed my password phone number and email and now I'm stuck in an endless loop of them trying to send info to the email and phone number I don't have access to. And there is no option ""no longer have access to these"" that is shown in every video on how to fix your account. Absolutely 0 customer service options other than an automated loop that never finishes fixing your account.",0
"App doesnt care about UX as long as they are getting clicks and ad views. Theres a whole segment of the population that uses FB almost exclusively for Marketplace. You wiuld think that for an app thats been in development for over a decade that they would have ironed out the bugs by now. Unfortunately, Marketplace is still horrible to use, and hardly works as intended, particularly on mobile devices. The filter features and search regions do not work, and making a car listing is heinously bugged",0
"Go to your settings and click ""off Facebook activity"". No company should have access to your life like that. It won't let me uninstall it. I've been talking about going back to a flip phone for a while now. This might be the thing that does it",0
I don't like the new layout on my Z Fold 5. It squishes my feed and the side bar option even squishes all icons together so it's completely unusable. I have to close out the app and reopen it to get a working bar again,0

I wish my phone would not default to RCS messaging because 90% of the time it fails and I don't realize it till I get back in my messages and realized that the message did not go through and when I click on it it says send sms? And I hit that and immediately the message goes through but I wish it was not even an option to have RCS messages and I don't know how to turn it off permanently because it always defaults every time I go back into the messaging. If I am missing something pls do tell.thx,0
I have a Samsung Fold and since the new update I can only see the proper FB pages when I have my fold open to the inside screen. When it is closed all the icons on the front screen are layered on top of each other and you cannot click on them properly. Please fix this glitch.,0

"Facebook apparently did not test the new layout on many devices. They repositioned the task bar (home, marketplace, etc.) from the top to the side. For mobile, where most devices have more screen top to bottom than left to right, this is bad design. The problem comes when you are on a device that is more narrow. The new layout on a folded Z Fold 4 is nearly unusable. This new bar takes up so much space and squeezes the feed. Something as simple as the comments button has to wrap to a new line.",0
"I have used FB extensively for years and I love the platform. The reason for my 2-stars is because of a bug, when I rotate my phone from vertical to horizontal on my Samsung S24 Ultra the pictures on the Facebook app do not auto rotate, meaning I cannot see horizontal photos full screen. This is very annoying to me and frustrating. Any other app like Android Gallery would auto rotate the photos. I checked all settings and spent hours trying to fix this with no success.",0
"I really don't mind a lot of things about the app that could /should be better but, I've had to use the galaxy fold phone due to work and, the integration of the app is just bad. Since I can't pin the navigation bar, whenever I open the app it's always on the left, as if in tablet mode (even when it's not), making the feed display smaller. I don't like that menu there even in tablets. And the stories count is the same in phone mode as in tablet mode, so they become tiny in phone mode. Fix!",0
With the lastest update for the zfold four the navigation bar has shifted to the left side rather than at the top. I could probably deal with this if it weren't for the fact that it constantly glitches and all the options overlay each other and the option to share gets eaten behind the navigation bar. The only fix so far has been to click on a link I share to someone and then it temporarily brings back the navigation bar to the top until it changes back again eventually. Please fix this.,0
"maybe it's just me but i find the entire interface incredibly difficult to navigate. i have such a difficult time trying to do anything but post to news feed or react to other's posts. i dislike the entire experience. i can't figure out the whole ""story"" thing, i can't figure out how to add or select music for it, i can't figure out my shop page and how to manage it... i guess I'm just not cut out for fb 🤷🏻",0
"I have enjoyed this app for years, but this most recent update is garbage. It moved the tabs from the top to the left side, thereby making all of the content on the feed, video, etc tabs smaller. On my phone, after viewing the ""recent update"" tab thing, all of the tabs think into one overlaying tab. I then have to close and reopen the app to have them reset. It is just annoying.",0
"Using on the Galaxy Z Fold5 and after the last update the front screen has the navigation bar on the left side of the screen, causing the news feed to be thin and annoying. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't fix it. I've tried multiple other ways and nothing has worked. Please fix this. Guess I'll just use Lite for now.",0
"The app works usually, but it constantly changes the app settings back to the defaults (start videos with sound being a major one). This has become an almost daily issue where I have to readjust app settings. Edit: I had to bump the stars down because the issue is getting more frequent, and the occurrences of seeing inappropriate things on the timeline is ridiculous.",0
"The latest update on z fold 4 is garbage! It defaults to tablet mode on the skinny outer screen, which makes the app almost unusable. I had to install the lite app just to use Facebook again. Even if you try to use it like it is the navigation buttons jumble together. I also have a Galaxy tab, and that defaults to the phone layout. Facebook, please fix this mess .",0
The new update for Facebook is terrible for the z fold phones barely any room to read anything on the front screen the app forces me to open the phone completely to even be able to read anything. Placing the navigation bar on the left side of the screen is a bad idea. At least make it so I can change where I want the location of the bar.,0
"For the Galaxy Fold 4, the new update is awful. The new update with the home button down the side instead of across the top in phone mode makes it so that I can't see half the stuff posted now because the timeline is scrunched vertically. The only way to use the app is if I open my phone to tablet mode. I'd post a picture to show, but there isn't that option.",0
Using the Z Fold 4 and the new update has made the navigation bar huge and now located on the left side of the screen. Making it nearly impossible to see or read anything. Other times the navigation bar shrinks into some weird symbols smashed into the top corner and is unusable. Terrible update. Will be uninstalling if it doesn't fix soon. 👎,0
"Whenever I press the navigation button to view my open apps, the Facebook window is suddenly not there. If I try to reopen it, it goes immediately to wherever I was -- so it obviously didn't close. So why does it disappear every time? This has been an intermittent issue that changes with various updates -- after some updates, it doesn't close the window anymore. And then other updates, it does that again. PLEASE FIX THIS!",0
"I love the social aspect of Facebook, but recently, every time I post or share, the app abruptly and quickly scrolls down then back up, by itself. It's annoying when you are trying to make more than one post or sharing memories. Also, too many pages and people that I DO NOT follow or are not friends with, as well as posts from groups I am NOT a member of, are showing up in my feed as if I do or am. Not the suggested stuff, though there are too many of those too.",0
"Ok app, if you can deal with constant reshuffling of the interface. Unfortunately, it can and will spam you with notifications. Even if you turn it off everywhere (countless locations), every few updates it still ""grows"" new ways to boggle you with unrelated content, like the Hydra. The ""new"" features tend to show up leading to the quarterly earning report. I know you're trying to keep up the engagement and numbers, but please try to do it in a more subtle way",0
"I don't know what has happened, but all of a sudden I can no longer just close out of the app. I have to leave the main screen and go to Marketplace or reels, then hit Back twice to close out. Otherwise it just loops between main screen and notifications. Also, if I click on notifications and go back to the feed, it takes me all the way to the top again. It doesn't refresh properly. WTH",0
"After a recent update, my ""like"" options have completely disappeared. When I click to like something it shows a series of blank, white circles. It does the same when trying to see who has liked a pictures. It also glitches so bad. I can't even scroll through anything because it freezes and lags continuously. I've tried to restart my phone, reinstall the app...nothing helps.",0
"Shuts down constantly. I don't know what the issue is because I have tried everything I can think of. The app is constantly freezing and shutting down. It signs me out multiple times a day randomly. I've tried checking for updates, signing out and back in, changing passwords, uninstalling and reinstalling, the list goes on. So frustrating!",0
"I need to know why suddenly the app is squished and basically unreadable on my galaxy Z Fold (while it's folded). It's fine if I flip my phone open and use it that way, but I don't always want to do that. It's basically unusable in front screen folded mode. Please fix this. I don't know if it was an interface update or what, but it wasn't like this yesterday.",0
"New, since Feb 13, when I click on mine or anyone else's cover photo, it's a blank screen. I can't view all my cover photos. It's not saying it needs an update. I see more stuff from pages I don't even follow, than those I do and even my FB friends. Show me the stuff from my friends and pages I actually FOLLOW! I am not even getting all notifications. WHAT THE HECK???",0
Impossible to watch reels now. Anytime you try to open one it will take you to the reels page and start playing a completely unrelated video. No way to watch the one you clicked on except to scroll through the posters page until you find it and MAYBE it will work. For all the data they steal and privacy they invade you'd think they had the resources to make a functional app.,0
"frustrated I don't get a lot of my notifications for things like replies and end up seeing the reply later and still don't have any notifications, also on reels and videos the reply comments won't load, a lot of the time the videos won't flip on my phone, not the reels just to clarify, I'm talking about wide videos. These problems have been going on for a few years now and I've seen troubleshoots and reports and it.. never stops. so yeah getting frustrating",0
"Lately, I haven't been able to view pictures that are posted in the comment section of any post. I have gone through all the steps including clearing all cache, restarting my phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the facebook app, cleared all cookies, made sure my app was up to date, force stopped, and so much more. Nothing has helped, and I haven't heard back about the issue since I have reported it. So I reported it again. The app seems to always have one issue or another.",0
"Glitching out horribly. I can't access messenger through the app, then when trying to access through Facebook, get stuck in messenger and can't get back to my newsfeed. I have had to uninstall & reinstall Facebook a few times to get unstuck. Super frustrating as I run a few groups and get lots of DM's. Of course Facebook itself is just a nightmare of algorithms, control, suppression, commercialization and horrible overall as well. Definitely not the wonderful space it was.",0
"I love how I can no longer use Facebook sign in for different apps that I made using Facebook! ""For your account security, logging into Facebook from an embedded browser is disabled"" And it doesn't matter if you go into your setting to change it, it will still block you! It's super fun not being able to open Spotify through apps like TikTok when pre-saving songs",0
"This app is ok. I haven't had an issue with it since until just recently. It's not notifying me when friends leave messages or when they like and comment on my photos. Notifications aren't working the right way, but other than that, it's a good platform to connect with loved ones in your life. Hopefully, Facebook will fix this issue sooner rather than later.",0
"Update: Just updated again and STILL CANT ROTATE IMAGES! Videos rotate fine. Why is this disabled for images??? I want landscape mode back! ‐---------- The last two updates seem to have disabled auto rotation of images. I cant view landscape inages in landscape mode. Auto rotation still works in other apps, so it's not my phone. Also, the media setting to open links in external browser doesn't seem to do anything. All links open in Facebook's browser.",0
"the timeline often refreshed while reading posts. there are more advertised posts and advertisements than personal stories. there have been times when the frequency of the timeline refreshing has prevented the user(me) from making it past two one line posts, which would then disappear. Once a valuable tool for interpersonal communication it is now more for dissociation and disinformation. I miss my friends, especially the ones I don't see often.",0
"Can't delete a phone number from profile. Getting message stating it's a log on device that system doesn't recognize. Not able to do it through messenger app with the same results. I log on with my cell phone and Mac and having been doing so since I've had the app. This is a security issue. Fix This!!! In this day and age one should be able to delete a phone number associated with their account immediately, no questions. Only work around for this is you have to deactivate your account.",0
Don't know if anyone else is having this issue. Unable to log in. Password doesn't work. Reset password doesn't work. Was able to get code sent to email. Finally on facebook. But if I log out. Probably won't be able to get back in. So staying signed in. Also when trying to log in through google chrome. Password still don't work. Tried to reset. It didn't work. So I don't know whats going on with the log in. I hope someone didn't hack my account.,0
"I no longer have friends show on my news feed, it is all pages that ""the Facebook app thinks I would like "" I x them one by one but more pages pop up filling the space including the pages I clicked on the ""don't see this page again "" come back around. I also have Facebook set for manual updates instead of automatic but it keeps updating on its own. I agree with others who say that Facebook has gotten stupid.",0
"I get so sick of the videos that are chopped up and cut from someone else's account. I hate the new way the descriptions are on videos and how they jump to the first comment. Or when I hit less, it takes me to some dumb hash tag page. When wanting to watch a series of reels, it's impossible to know which one is which, and nothing has a date or when it was posted on the reels. I like the concept, but there has to be a better way to execute the idea and design.",0
"Did someone buy Facebook, or is Mark bored and wanting to mess with people!? The constant changes are horrible. If they actually made changes that were improvements to the platform, I would be happy with them, but so far, they are not helpful. Also, the increased amount of ads and sponsored sites cluttering your feed is absolutely ridiculous! No matter what features you turn off in settings for every post you see from a friend, you see three or more of these ads or sponsors!",0
"Facebook changed in so many ways and it not for the better it gets dumber every day. For sample, the news feed u see something and you want to view the comments and it shows most relevant by default and your having to keep clicking show all, this is so dumb. the app keeps crashing, overloading your phone forcing it to shut down and protect it self from Facebook. don't get me started on the scams and the video that are not appropriate.",0
"Why does Facebook need access to my contacts, and phone calls? Also its annoying that logged me out automatically, I try to change the password, it generates the same code over 10 times, and it doesn't work as many times, so yeah less than happy, add the amount of reels and adds that keep popping out even tho I block them, and the recommendations of people I don't even know.",0
"WILDLY rife with glitches lately, more than I've seen in years. I never get all of my direct notifications. I've made sure all my settings are appropriately engaged, still not getting fully a third (maybe more) of my notifications. Feed refreshes arbitrarily so I lose my place. App has started not showing comments I've made on posts, even with ""All Comments"" enabled. Memories are completely borked (can't see them in their entirety, like it's 2011 again; also cannot open the photos). And so on.",0
"Ridiculous update -- the Back button no longer works. You have to use the one within Facebook. I have no idea what possible good this does unless it improves tracking. Also, for several months now, they changed a setting. It used to be you could open all links in an external browser. Now it doesn't work for that -- it says it only does that for links set in Messages. Annoying and ridiculous.",0
"As a senior, the apps are nothing but an annoyance. They don't adjust text to suite my need for lagrer print, and rotated my same size fonts 🙄, just more of them. I also see no need to doawload, either of them, when I can have a better experience from my browser. So when they decide to shut the browsers out I'll go elsewhere, and not hassle with it.",0
"Edit: The update disabled the multiple pictures on the regular news feed and moved to to my personal time-line. They always have to screw things up! This last update has caused a problem with uploading multiple pictures in one post. Didn't have any issues until it updated. And I tried uninstalling it, but it forces you to update before you can get back into it. The pictures go to my story but doesn't actually post to my time line.",0
"FIX THE BACK BUTTON!! FIX THE BACK BUTTON!! FIX THE BACK BUTTON! I've started closing the app every time I can't use the back button. I seem to be using Facebook less and less because it's become more aggravating than it's worth. Oh, and forcing me to watch a video and not be able to back it up with a slide bar? I just wind up closing the app. again.",0
"So as reviews say, the back button broke. Chalk that to minor inconvenience, but it's part of a bigger problem. The interface broke compared to a year ago. Across time, more features left, but pretend they're there. You can't share to w business page anymore unless logged in as the page. It gives you the option but has given an error for a while. That means losing the place you were at, because you can't put the link URL INTO FB to get to it. They should allow you to comment AS your profile.",0
"Same complaint. Back button no longer available. Additionally, I can no longer access / download files. Facebook wants me to change setting to allow for downloads. However, the option is not there under permission to do so. Scrolling down to Storage doesn't give me the option as well. There is a screenshot in Reddit with the same issue. There are no suggestions on how to resolve.",0
"The major annoyance I deal with is the back function on the phone no longer controls the app. I have to use the arrow in the upper left corner all the time. The next major annoyance is that in the recent app section there will be multiple instances of Facebook open. Third, there so it's very bloated and uses a ton of data. Overall a terrible app.",0
"3 problems that just started recently: 1. The type bar under posts defaults to ""send message"" instead of ""comment"" which was much more useful. 2. My android back button on the bottom right doesn't work to go back a screen within Facebook, I have to use the top left arrow which is much less convenient. 3. I got a message saying I'd ""violated community guidelines"" and wouldn't be able to use the platform fully for 24 hours. No explanation so I have no idea what I did.",0
I have a Pixel 5. All of a sudden while in the fb My navigation keys no longer work while viewing specific types of posts or checking notifications. So basically the back arrow that I have at the bottom of my screen to navigate through backing out of applications or screens. No longer works well looking at specific content on Facebook. This just started happening yesterday. It's incredibly annoying and inconvenient. Fix it please.,0
"I keep seeing old posts, trying to find pages for events has become more complicated. And worst of all now, when I close out of all my apps, this one stays up. Until I specifically close it by itself. I have the same phone and have never had this issue before. Started around the New Year. Ive looked through the permissions of my app and can't figure out how to fix it. Facebook is becoming more of a head ache than anything else honestly.",0
"Links no longer automatically open in external browser, despite checking the option in the Media settings menu. This means manuslly tapping extra commands to go to my paid app subscriptions directly. To make things worse, the News tab only shows about a dozen or so articles each day that I can't refresh to see additional articles, which defeats the purpose of a news aggregation service. Otherwise, the app is usable when it's not showing you an ad every other post.",0
"What is with all the glitches?! The back button is whatever; the glitches on the admin side of groups are a totally different thing! One minute I can give feedback on a comment, and literally 10 minutes later I don't have the option. Seriously? I could literally write a novel on all the random issues. The ""most recent"" selection on comments? The disappearing and reappearing notifications? The audience glitch? The picture glitches? Seriously, stop doing updates on an app that was just fine!",0
"When I scroll through reels, some will have sound, then some wont, and i have to pause and then unpause the video to get it. If i go to view a notification on a past comment, it doesn't always bring me to my comment or the video i commented on. The back arrow doesnt work. Facebook used to be about connecting and communicating with friends and family, now it just feels like its attempting to be another youtube. I have more complaints but im running out of characters.",0
"If you get to involved, running, and participating in groups, and pages messes up how well it work. My messenger will not let me click on a profile, and hit message without it asking me which profile to send a message from, and when I click my profile(which is already the default) it won't let me do anything... Lots of glitches for them to fix. Overall a great app that helps make the world alot better place, just wish it was on point....",0
"Seems like something is always wrong with marketplace. Marketplace Assistant is annoying and always messaging to ask if something is sold. I always mark something sold when I sell it. Now you can't say no, it makes you edit the ad. When something dose work well, they change it just to change it. Which most times makes it worse than before. After 2 weeks, when you repost, an ad it moves all your ads into the household category even if you did not have it in that category. It's very frustrating!",0
"Facebook is great for being able to communicate with those you don't see in person or who live in another time zone. It has lost touch of actually giving you updates on friends though and is mostly full of spam pushing ads and pages. If you click not interested or stop seeing particular things, you can guarantee it will show you that in force, so good luck if you have a bad habit or addiction your trying to drop. It needs to go back to just updates on friends with occasional pages posts.",0
"Gave you 5 stars for a long time. But since the recent update, it's really buggy. I can't create story with multiple photos and add music. The music icon disappeared, so my story clip is so boring now. The alternate option is to create story with multiple photos using Clip Mash-Up function and add music. This feature no longer works as well, just says ""something went wrong, try again later"" been trying for days but nope, still no good. Please fix asap. This is annoying.",0
"Whatever has been changed in last 2 to 3 weeks (March 2024) has mean my news feed and a lot of other areas now appear in portrait despite my Samsung tablet being set to landscape. I'm disabled, I can't 'just turn it around'. This is an accessibility issue and needs fixing. It was mostly OK before. Meta fixed Instagram so it now respects what you have your device set to. Sort it out.",0
"Probably for the ads in every back move you get a refresh that ignores your previous page and erase everythng. You write a comment for 10-20 mins and out of the blue you lost it, and it's nowhere to find. Videos are totally a mess. Speed doesn't work in full screen, and in usual mode when you put x2 times you get x4 times, when you press x1.5 times you get x6 times 😆, totally messed up. And some videos don't implement any speed even though they have the options. As worse as it can get...",0
"The video seek bar and audio controls are always covered by the uploader's profile info and like buttons. If you wish to pause the video to seek to a certain position or mute it, you have to tap on the video to reveal the controls and have about 1 second to use any of the mentioned controls before they automatically get covered again. So it is a neverending race between attempting to use the controls and dealing with this idiotic design..",0
"Progressively worse... Typing a response and you need to Google something, get back to app and it has closed your message. Well just scroll to the item again? Eh no, because basically anytime you open/close something the whole timeline randomizes again. Schizophrenic experience. Typing birthday messages is monstrously slow. Switching notifications for replies works half the time, at best. Often it only shows the option to enable them and it never toggles to disable. Guys, fix it!",0
REALLY hate Facebook predictive text. It is so easy to accidentally send the wrong message. I have even become reluctant to comment at all! Maybe not such a bad thing. But hey Facebook - at least make it an OPTIONAL setting!! AND make autoplay clips optional. Having a quiet scroll through your feed is no longer an option.,0
"Photos still won't view in landscape.... You update the app, happy days, and then wham broken again!. Intermittently, the back button doesn't work and takes you back to the beginning. Expanding commments, deletes them before viewed! This is poor testing of the user interface before posting updates! It isn't difficult, if it doesn't work properly....please don't post an update!",0
My Facebook notification isn't working. It doesn't shows new notification. And if there is a new notification sometimes it shows all the old notifications as well. For example if there's a notification it shows 13 notifications. I reported them the issue. But they didn't think of fixing this. I even unistalled Facebook and then reinstalled. But it didn't help. It has been more than a week now. Are you ever going to fix it,0
"Have had to uninstall and reinstall twice today alone, because with my fold phone any time I use an app with the phone open then go back to Facebook my view is messed up. Just started yesterday, but my bar is on the side instead of top and everything is cut off. Then it won't let me even select something to view full screen. Force closing the app doesn't work, nor does restarting the phone. Only app that does this.",0
"It is a good app as it connects people, but sometimes it bugs and the report feature doesn't work well. It is not recommended for teenagers as the social environment in this app is bad, with low-quality content and a poor algorithm. Even if you adjust the settings, it will still recommend irrelevant and violent content. There are too many scammers, so be careful when clicking on links because Facebook does not care whether it will cause harm or not.",0
"I hate the way Facebook overrides my phones screen brightness and automatically brightens my screen for videos. There are so many ""suggested for you"" ""ads"" and ""sponsored posts"" now that it's difficult to see actual updates from friends. I get you have to make money from advertising but its a lot. The only reason I use Facebook at all is because it has all my past photos stored, otherwise its not that relevant. Also so many reels that are just recycled tik tok videos.",0
"Videos stuck / lagging. When users tap to open any video from home feed, the video will open and continue playing for 1~2 seconds, then the video will flicker and stuck but the audio keep playing. Sometime it will stuck for a 1~3 seconds but will continue playing afterwards. Sometimes it will stuck for a long time and i need to move the video slider rewind or forward a few seconds to make it play normally. I have tried : -clear cache -clear data -reinstall But the problem still persist.",0
"Latest update really buggy... Descenders of letters are cut off so a y looks like a v, a j like like I, etc. The messenger notification in Facebook shows an unread message, but the messenger shows all messages read. Sometimes the reactions emojis have a pink outline. Lots of weirdness. I've been using the app for years, but this version is a mess.",0
"Nothing but issues with this app these days. I rarely see my friends posts, so I can go on someone's page and then it will show that they've been active posting things I never see. Or it shows me old stuff from several days prior on my feed. I (don't) get notifications on the app, or I get a notification and clear it, and it still says it's new and I'll keep getting it. I've deleted the app and made sure it's updated, tried clearing the cache or cookies, tried force stop. I've tried everything.",0
"I'm not liking my profile menus on the left side of the screen. I use a Z Fold and everything has become scrunched on the right side of the screen and it cuts off names and words. Everything is elongated and I hate it. I'll still log in to check on friends and family, but not as often since it's so jumbled and hard to read.",0
"My photos have disappeared. Example- my profile pictures album says there are 428 pictures. When I click that album, it's the first 30 pictures I ever posted from 2007. I've tried logging out, uninstalling and installing the app again, resetting my phone....everything. If I log in with the web browser it works. This app is getting worse.",0
"The new update has basically rendered my front screen useless on the zfold4. Can't see anything due to the menu bar going down the left side of my screen. If you wanna see a meme or a picture you have to click on it. A typed post forget about it, you have to open up the big screen.",0
"I would like to complain about your app. It suddenly stop working and something pops out, ""SESSION EXPIRED"" while Im scrolling. And then suddenly my account automatically log out, I have been trying to log in but still ERROR. I've been using your app for years now and it's the first time that I encounter this situation. I hope you fix facebook app because I'm using it for work and other things.",0
"what a disappointment, like dude, i passed all of the requirements and all things needed to use a frickin' marketplace, yet i can't still use it?! like, what the heck, dude, and the is that one thing that always makes me angry, the videos are always laggy!!! the sound and the video itself are delayed!! and stories are also blurry. we need to use someone's iPhone to make it good! my old rating on this app was 4 stars, and since i got so disappointed, imma give it something that it deserves.",0
Screen keeps dimming when scrolling through newsfeeds for some reason this has only happened since I opened what I believed to be a legitimate message and now I am having loads of issues with that specific account. Any help to resolve this would be greatly appreciated and I have already tried logging out & back in and uninstalling and reinstalling it again but still no luck.,0
"Latest update screwed up UI layout on outside screen for Samsung Zfold3. Started displaying inside screen layout which has primary icon links up and down the left side of the screen instead of along the top. Current workaround is to launch FB app, unfold and fold phone, reopen app which corrects the layout. Please open bug and resolve with next release. Thanks.",0
"Facebook has, for some reason, decided not to let me have access to reels. I have pages I manage that I can watch reels on, but my personal page has no access at all. I used to be able to watch them when they were sent to me, but now they just say page not found. And trying to connect to someone about the issue is a joke.",0
"Facebook just isn't worth it anymore. How can they even still call it ""Facebook"", when mostly all I ever see are ads for various different who knows what things that pop up all the time constantly. My entire immediate family are on Facebook, and I haven't seen any posts by any of them in the last week, unless I went to their pages specifically. If all I wanted was to see ads I could go back to having cable TV. Can't find anything in Marketplace either, just keeps repeating things, and not local.",0
"Can you please fix the bug where your navigation/notification bar gets crammed into the top left and leaves an incredibly obnoxious blank bar on the whole left of your screen? When viewing in portrait mode all the readable content is cropped and the text squashed, and the navigation buttons become utterly unusable. FIX IT ASAP, PLEASE.",0
"The app isn't perfect but useable at times ... I mean really!? We all use the device s RAM, why can't we use a external storage!? Why do I need to uninstall an app just to get on another?! What's so hard about that?! Yes meta you are accountable in this mess too. This is a relevant point. Until then, two stars....",0
"THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING! i can't track my log in and log out sessions anymore, there's always nothing to show in that section, what happened to facebook??? THIS IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING, a lot had changed in this app, i used to really like it a lot and now it's just SO DISAPPOINTING. i hope you will bring it back.",0
"I have been using Facebook for a long time (much like anyone else) but the latest update is the WORST! The new A.I feature causes the app to constantly restart for 10 minutes, and I can't do anything about it. At this point, I may as well go back to the lite version that doesn't have A.I.",0
"Facebook updated and has gone way too far. I can no longer post videos of me playing music, I can't post pictures from a family weekend because I'm ""fishing for likes"". Wth???? Facebook has taken this way too far. I don't use any other social media and this is the way I connect with family. I guess it's not worth using anymore",0
"This latest update doesn't feel right. They made the reel screen too small. Now, most photos and videos are cut off on both sides. It just doesn't look good and isn't practical. I shouldn't have to click on every photo just to see the whole thing.",0
"Slowly killing people's capacity to enjoy deep, transformative thoughts, media, art. Instead providing messy, disorganized flow of content algorithmically optimized to bring profit through short-attention-span engagements. If you see something truly interesting and you look elsewhere, you know because life outside of phone calls you, there is a pretty good chance you will not find the thing any more. Searching for the missing pearl of course brings more engagement so all is good for Meta.",0
"The work,Meta has got is to create new applications. The different features kept in variant applications. You got a text, you must go to change into messeger for reading messages. Samelike, Insta and Threads & No Apk is totally feturized at one spot. Even, insta and messenger have no option for erasing multiple messages.Insta is somewhere good.All other Corporations are compiling and Meta is dispersing features. Really Exhausted Experince, I hope this suggestion would be considered.",0
"No longer gives me notifications of people tagging me in things or reacting to my comments. ALSO I do NOT like the view of videos... it turned into what looks like reels, even for longer videos. I liked it before where the videos were separated from the reels.",0
"the app is useful for events, and sometimes seeing posts of others. The problem is the ads and groups you aren't even a part of when you scroll. Weird, definitely translated, memes or washed up memes from awhile ago. Can hit hide or block this group, they will just show more random nonsense for an infinity of random groups posting nonsense from I guess older groups who interact with it for some reason. anyways I just want to see friends and family, not 90% of junk. close to deactivating",0
"Why does Facebook does not rotate there screen anymore, only can view in portrait view. Some things need to see both ways. No, it's not my device settings, all my other programs work, Facebook use to but not now. Think it may have started after their update.",0
"The new update with the z fold 5 doesn't open videos and doesn't show the option of "" suggested for you"" and ""following."" Now it is showing reals only. Also, the new update on the same phone it is glitchy and sometimes doesn't show the bar on the right when folded",0
"For some reason, now looks really stupid on the outside screen of a galaxy Samsung Zfold 5. I'm not sure what they did. They move navigation to the left of the screen. Now you have less screen to scroll, and everything looks terrible.",0
I've been locked out of my Facebook account for over 2 months now and nothing that they have suggested has helped me get back into my account fully. I've tried their give them a different email address for video verification and the code and that was a joke. I've tried changing my password and that was a joke and didn't resolve the issue. I've even called their customer service over the phone and that hasn't helped.,0
"suddenly I don't have reels can't make them don't have a short cut or option to add short cut to reels can't watch reels shared on messenger it sends me to page not found , in play store there are 2 Facebook apps they both install and uninstall at the same time ,it's been a month ,no matter what I have tried 😞😞😞😞",0
Everything is good but the video watch history makes an issue plz check it because it doesnt work properly like before and makes some issue to clear the video watch history. I tried more and more attempts to clear it but it doesnt work properly.,0
"Dear Papa Zuckerberg, none of us asked for the stupid AI search, but what WOULD be super cool is if you could fix the bug that causes videos to start playing with sound even if it's been turned off in the settings. Thanks, bruh",0
"I wish there was an option to enable or disable meta ai. The in facebook search option was better than meta ai, and I can no longer find posts with information that I need. 🙄 I find the constant moving of the ai button to be obnoxious. I'm not against ai, but please give us the option to choose it or remove it. I've asked the ai feature how to remove it 2x and it gave 2 different step by step instructions that aren't actually possible to follow.",0
Everytime I go an update Facebook it would not update unless I uninstall and reinstall it and this has been going on for a couple of months so when I reinstall it takes so long and a few attempts needs fixing! So because of this issue I've only rated 2 stars untill matters are fixed,0
"On the Z fold 4, it shrinks all icons for notifications, reels, market etc They are shrunk so closely to each other that one cannot even see a quarter of the bell icon for notifications. Please correct this with an update. I have the latest update.",0
"Latest update has ruined accessibility on dark mode. As someone who has eyesight difficulties and needs to use dark mode, the latest update now makes all notifications impossible to read. Other parts of the app are effected too, but mainly it's the notifications.",0
Facebook used to be good at the beginning when all posts were in chronological order but they screwed that up and now people miss posts because of it. Go back to the right way of doing things. All posts in Chronological order.,0
"1/23 App keeps stopping and doesn't return to page that was being viewed.....still keeps stopping 2/23, why ?still stopping through February and March why ??? Many updates since first posting this review !! April 24 still keeps stopping, sent problem and screen shot many times, no reply or acknowledged",0
"Since 4/18/24, Facebook has been shoving Meta AI down people's throats with no way to get rid of it. I tried to minimize by giving bad reviews on each one & the same suggestions keep popping up again. Most are not related to me. Just because I clicked on someone else's post, they assume it applies. National Siblings Day is an example. I'm an only child. Ugh. Very frustrating. I hate it.",0
"4/5/24 videos appear to be playing on the news feed now, if I hadn't spoken to soon.... Yep spoken to soon, playing videos on the news feed is sill a issue. 4/8/24, no video playing on the news feed is fixed. 90% of the videos will not play on news feed. No fixed with over a month of reports. 4/11/24, it appears the videos not playing on the news feed has been resolved, day 2 of it working. Thanks",0

Edit: after the new update whenever I click to see a video it pauses for 3-4 seconds but the audio will be playing. It's quite annoying to seek back 3 seconds. The comments for any posts are usually not at all related to the posts. It feels like a bot is handling all those pages and personal accounts. Furthermore the recommendation of videos is too poor and the reels videos (which we get in between videos) have a problem with seeking.,0

Very frustrating.Theres not any way that if someone wanted to get into an account that isn't theirs they wouldnt be able to.This is really getting me frustrated. It takes all of us to do this.,0

"Facebook is great for being able to communicate with those you don't see in person or who live in another time zone. It has lost touch of actually giving you updates on friends though and is mostly full of spam pushing ads and pages. If you click not interested or stop seeing particular things, you can guarantee it will show you that in force, so good luck if you have a bad habit or addiction your trying to drop. It needs to go back to just updates on friends with occasional pages posts.",0
too much data consumes and slow,0
"HELP! I have a Galaxy Z-Fold, and since the last update, my Facebook is constantly ""refreshing"" and bringing me back to the top. Example: looking at pictures in a post from a friend, hitting the back button when done, and I'm no longer at the post, I'm back to the top. Look at a video or Reel... same thing, back to the top. It's slow to load again, too. Terrible! Please fix it!!!!!!!",1
"I use Facebook quite a bit, but with the new layout of the app on my zfold4, it is annoying. The news feed, videos, marketplace, etc, are on the side from top to bottom instead of on top left to right. It cuts off some of the posts, and in order to view the entire post, you have to click it to view the post in full form. Also, when you go to videos or your profile and then choose to go back to news feed, all of the news feed, videos, etc, buttons are all scrunched and are literally overlapping.",1
"Facebook is a great platform, but the software is buggy. Everyone I ask have one or two issues. I am a lucky one that has multitudes of issues. From delayed or missing notifications, to posts that don't appear, to messages that I never receive. I've given up on Facebook support. After spending way too much time trying to explain it isn't my computer (some issues they can replicate) and each time I am 'helped' things get worse, I have given up on trying to get support.",1
"I'm on a Samsung Tab A8 10.5 screen size. I'm not sure if this glitch is universal or if its just my particular tablet. The latest update is doing weird things to notifications in dark mode. It turns them white if you haven't read the notification. I'm not sure why that is, but I hope they fix it because it is hard on my eyes. It also doesn't go into landscape mode and it used to do that. Not sure if there is a setting I'm missing somewhere in the app itself.",1
"This morning, I randomly got a notification that my session expired. I tried entering my password, getting SMS code, and an email code, and nothing is working. It just tells me there was an unexpected error while signing in and to try again later, or it gives me the blank white screen. 🤔 Most of the time, it functions pretty well. I don't care for all the sponsored posts and group suggestions. And Marketplace has a difficult time understanding when I want only search results in my state.",1
"Use Facebook mostly to keep up with family and general crafting groups. It's good for that however, the new UI changes to the app are terrible for my fold 5 front screen. I have to open most posts to see the full context and I'm just disappointed when I'm reminded whenever I open the app. I shouldn't have to interact with a post just to see all of what was written in the status section.",1
Been having an issue with videos freezing up for months. I have to close the app and restart it to get them to play again which means if I want to finish watching the video that froze I have to copy and paste the link into chrome. I figured it'd be a temporary problem that would get fixed quickly but it's been an ongoing problem for like 6 months.,1
"Good. FB used to be a lot more enjoyable. I'd say mid-pandemic the app changed so drastically that it's now not my ""go-to"" app to scroll, find memes/vids and connect with friends. It's become more of an advertising business which isn't necessarily a bad thing if they provided that same FB quality they enhanced on between 2015-2020. If you know you know. Otherwise great app in multiple aspects for other reasons.",1
"In general, I have never been an active user of FB and cannot speak about its all the functionality, but over the last few months I have been actively using the marketplace as a seller. I was very surprised at how buggy and inconsistent the UI and UX are. It seems that once upon a time something was programmed there and abandoned.",1
"The filters are not sortable when you are going live. Just like thousands of filters to go through. I'd like to have a simple background effect to use with my phone while going live. Like maybe a library background scene, or just a black background scene. Not a bunch of sponsored stuff that is in all kinds of different languages and all the silly ones. Can't you make them sortable?",1
"3/5/24 keeps saying ""session expired"" out of nowhere. Auto updates already enabled, cleared cache and data; logging back in manually gets me the same result. Incredibly frustrating. 3/13/20 This newest update is trash. Quit messing with things that are fine the way they are! My featured photos have been condensed to one block from 9 separate pix and play like a story? Seriously? Unless you're going to give me a music player like Myspace, just STOP 🙄",1
"Whole app is slow and glitching since the day that FB & Insta went down. I can't like posts, all videos are slow, laggy, and they skip, after watching one video the whole app will lag. When both apps went down, after about an hour Instagram was back up for me and it seemed like the rest of the people posting about it on the internet regained full access again but my Facebook has still been having issues ever since. I thought it was my phone but have since concluded theres a glitch in the system",1
"They keep changing things that nobody wants and ignore the real issues. Inappropriate content, such as adult films and porno graphic ads, are allowed. However, these violate the community standards, so they work around it. I have reported such videos multiple times, and yet they continue to show. No real problems are fixed. Also, they changed where the hot bar is, I hate that. And every time I turn around, there's a new update that does nothing. These updates are outdated for most phone models.",1
I never get notifications anymore. my messages notifications do but that is sparingly. the app floods you with adds and oversaturates it with an endless loop of whatever you listened to one time or read a couple other times. hardly ever do I see things that I actually follow or know. most of it is from random people or groups I've never heard of. I barely see my friends activities anymore. your product is nothing more than add dump central.,1
"Ive been a member of facebook for a REALLY long time, and have had nothing but mostly good experiences. However, this latest update is pure rage fuel. Every time I put the app in the background even for a split second, it takes me back to the top of my feed. If I open a reel to watch it, I cant back out of it without it going to the top of my feed and then I lose the rest of the reels, or have to scroll endlessly to get back to them. This ""feature"" has GOT to go.",1
"Since the most recent update, the backup arrow has been not working on my phone when i'm using facebook. I have to use the back arrow on the facebook app to be able to go back to the previous page. It is super annoying. And I really wish that they would fix it. Plus not to mention, the amount of ads added to the videos. I can't even watch a video without an ad popping up. I'm beginning to lose my like for facebook. Please fix all issues. Thanks.",1
"Hadn't really had many problems except for these TWO URKING issues. One issue is that it will tell me I have notifications when I log in, and when I click on the notification bell, it shows me nothing new until I refresh the page. Next issue is that when I'm watching reels, I'll watch video #1, scroll and then video #2, and then video #1 will come up again and so will video #2. It does this the whole time I try to watch reels and it's getting old!",1
"The only gripe I have is with Facebook LIVE. It will not allow me to switch to landscape. I've tried changing settings and all. When I try to connect while in landscape, a message appears saying Landscape is not supported. However, if I uninstall Facebook and then doawload it again, then it will allow me to record in landscape (one time). Please fix this.",1
I think Facebook is a great SM Platform. I also think it's hard to navigate the last year in terms of the way it glitches so often. Returning me to my homepage in the middle of reading an article. Closing out Reels in the middle of making one. Going back to my homepage when I'm trying to backspace an article. Closing out of videos untimely. Telling me my sessions have expired and to log in again. Not having an option of inviting everyone who liked a post at once. Thank You,1
"The most recent update caused the back button to cease working. More importantly, for the past month, my feed and in my groups, it is the older posts that show. In groups I have it set for most recent but I sometimes do not see the newer posts and comments for several hours after they are posted. This is something that just started occuring within this past month. I am not at all pleased with the latest few updates.",1
"I mainly use Facebook for the marketplace, but lately it's has been a terrible experience with the latest updates. Once you tap on a listing, then try and hit the back button it does not return you to the listing search results, but to the recent search list, and when you try and search it again it doesn't respond. It's very frustrating when your 50 deep down a page, try to go back a page and you have to start all over again.",1
"Managing pages is cumbersome. Same things over and over. I see less of my friends and favorites than I do sponsored posts. I'll get notifications, open the app, and they're not there until much later. If I open a browser, they're there. Business posts at insta need to be routable manually to the correct business page. Pre-filling interests/business types doesn't work for all businesses. Let us customize.",1
"Account gets hacked. I delete a post. Even though it's in the archives, or trash, sometimes I still see it. A week later, I still see the post I've deleted. X-rated sites are suggested on my page, and I didn't want the suggestion. I request that fewer feeds pop up, and I still see them. Add pop up, and I don't need them. I do like how fb allow one to connect with each other. The games are nice to play. I can connect app games with fb and get extra bonuses.",1
"It was a great app but the updates that are just frequent changes get bothersome. Marketplace seems to have no idea what a set location means for users, which makes it occasionally annoying to use. Scammers are still rampant though, and all I get from any sort of staff are bots. But at least it has gotten a lot better with the latest updates, glad to see my notifications working again.",1
"Another person has complained about the glitches in January already but nothing has been done about it. WOW! Deleto.g app because it has become unusable. On opening the app, the feed refreshes with a flash consistently without having to touch the screen. Also, please return FB to the way it was where it shows all your contacts' posts and allow the user to change if they want to see the person's posts or not.",1
The current update that has come out has serious effective the usability of the app. The tool bar down the left side of the screen isn't needed for app viewing and really effects sumsung fold users as our front screen is very slim. You can't see anything on it. I don't want to open my phone simply for Facebook. Perhaps a setting should be added to remove the toolbar if the users wishes?,1
"I couldn't find anywhere else to leave feedback for Facebook or Meta. I tried all the 'contact us' pages and several searches online to see if there was anywhere I could, and this is the best I got. So I've used Facebook for years, and your agloriths are great in some senses, but they still suffer from the same echo-chamber effects of feeding people more content that matches their existing view. And hate speech is repeatedly slipping through your content filters.",1
"Can't ever read reel captions. They appear for literally 1 second, then a comment left on the reel takes its place. Pretty annoying when you are trying to read what the creator is saying, especially if you don't enjoy reading the rude comments some folks like to leave on reels. If you switch back and forth between reels, the caption reappears.... and then immediately disappears again. I'm definitely not the only one having this issue.",1
"I am using Facebook for quite a long time, but since I updated the Facebook few days ago, I am unable to skip the video for your desired time by draging the video timeline point. because it is hide in the bottom of the screen and when you drag your screen above another video start. so please fix this problem as soon as possible. thanks",1
"We want a feature that enables us to play the live videos and recorded live videos, that have length more that 20 minutes in background over other apps not only within Facebook. This will be a very comfortable to listen to the content without consuming batteries, and having more time to do other tasks while enjoying listening to the videos. I hope to consider this feature in upcoming updates.",1
Had to update the app today. The video portion now sucks. Put it back to how it was where you can see videos and reels separately. There are times I watch short reels and other times where I want to see full length videos. They are all labeled as reels now even when clicking videos you guys keep making changes and it is not for the better. These updates are ruining facebook.,1
"In general, great. Every now and then some changes are applied that are worse and some that are better. Don't like how often the location of some tiles changes, I.e one day groups are in the top navigation bar, then the next day have to search for them around the app. Otherwise, good app.",1
"Look, like most of us, FB is older. Which is fine, but I feel like it's always trying to do too much, it's just overkill. Today I was simply trying to read a caption of a reel I had paused. Every two seconds, it would scroll me back the top of caption. Then when I got halfway through, it would start flashing the comments. If I wanted to see them, I would have gone to the comments section. No marquee needed. Can we just read? Why do we need life soundtracks always too? 🙄 Irritating.",1
"It's good just a lot of things happening like the stupid AI meta thing, face book has just gotta be more straight forward with the buttons and controls idk what mar Zuckerberg is doing with Facebook but it was a lot better like 2 years ago nice and simple. Also why is there a separate app to text on to download messenger 🙄. Just the AI stuff is unnecessary even coming from someone slightly under 20. Was just trying to fix my search bar but it'd just delete which was annoying asf. Instagram betr",1
Its format could use some revamping. It's a bit boring that it's the same as it's always been. Options for different formats would.be fun. It glitches in landscape view. I find it would be nice if you could choose exactly what you'd see each day. A list you could make In order of what you want to see. I find it too random and often shows you very little of what you want to see. Still it's nice to find artist etc that you want to learn from. I think it could focus more on community.,1
"Too much ads these days, kinda gets annoying to see ads popping up every now and then. Facebook is not anymore that relaxing, stress relieving social media to use, it's way too much commercial nowadays. Facebook app is very heavy occupies away too much storage, on the other hand alternate to this app, facebook lite is boring to use. Facebook is too big for my opinion to merely matter, but I would really appreciate if you guys can look down to my opinion, I am ready to change my rating anytime.",1
"bug in some features like opening a video link from messenger when my friends send a video clip, it goes something like the video link failed to open or something like that, I assume it is due to facebook lite 'cause some of my friend using it and I used Facebook main apps. I hope you fix it. Thank you 😇",1
For the most part it's ok. But marketplace gives me problems. Either it says something I posted is a knock off when I bought it from the store and still has tags keeps threatening to ban me from marketplace. Also it doesn't give me the option to purchase and ship I have to uninstall and then reinstall the app for the function to be available.,1
"It's a good app for social and whatnot. However, everyone I know is able to make a Facebook avatar except for me. It's really frustrating because it tells me something went wrong or it needs to be updated but I have a new phone and the app is on the most recent update. I check it every once in a while to see if it changed but it's not even in the drop down menu. It's whatever I guess. I was never one of the cool kids anyways lol",1
Well Facebook is Facebook! Had it for years. Wish they could change a few things. Like maybe when I actually show less of certain feeds (you would actually show less and not more 😒) and also move the sad button away from the care button (tired of thinking I hit the laughing button for serious stuff) and also add a middle finger and thumbs down please thanks!,1
"The app developers have failed to address long-standing issues, making it frustrating to watch videos. The video player acts inconsistently, sometimes opening the wrong player or playing random videos in the background. It's impossible to smoothly play the next video. Unacceptable.",1
I don't like the random people they keep shoving I my face asking if I know them. And you cant change your news feed to see the most recent. Instead you get randomly ordered posts some from days or weeks ago. It's STUPID. I can't stand it to the point I deactivate my FB evey few months for a while. Also just because someone I know follows a page doesn't mean I want to follow ot or see it. They just start adding it to your news feed.,1
just installed on new fone. wont install english uk and can't see any pictures. tried twice to intstall. 22/03/2024. Can only scroll 2/3 posts then no more. Have to keep logging in and out to get it to work. Also reported nudity and was told it's not offensive.😡09/04/24. Since last update when I get messenger message and FB notification won't go away unless I delete and reinstall FB.😡,1

The App suddenly undego an update and it made my Samsung Fold 5 front facing screen really difficult to use based on the new layout. Everything is compressed to the right side leaving the left side the shortcuts. Main facing screen is fine though. Prefer the old layout.,1
"Can someone fix the application on the Z fold 4? My layout makes some of the functions completely unaccessible. The screen doesn't fit right. I have to keep uninstalling the app and reinstalling to be back to the normal format, then it reverts back to this new version. Fix it Jesus!!! I need my facebook",1
"Facebook is a popular social media platform that allows you to connect with friends, family, and people from all over the world. With the Facebook app, you can easily share updates, photos, and videos with your friends, and you can also discover interesting content from pages and groups you follow. The app has a user-friendly interface and offers features like news feed, notifications, and messaging. You can also join events, create pages, and e",1
"Sure, here's an honest 3-star review of the Facebook app focusing on its failure to combat spam: --- The Facebook app is a convenient way to stay connected with friends and family, but it falls short when it comes to tackling spam effectively. While the platform has made efforts to improve, spam remains a persistent issue. Despite reporting spam accounts and content, I still encounter spammy posts and friend requests regularly. The spam filters seem inconsistent and often miss obvious spam!",1
I loved this app up until the new updates. Now when I click on the app I get a black screen or app is loading and nothing more comes of it. Sometimes I am able to sign on and other times it's nothing but a hassle. I have reinstalled the app and it still does the same thing. I really hope whatever is going on with this app is fixed.,1
"It has become an essential part since its inception mid 2000, with enabling connection across the globe and time passed. However, the AI generated distraction is so unavailable at times, that i frequently have to uninstall or not open the app.",1
"The app is okay but I swear the more it shoves AI down my throat, the closer I come to deleting it permanently. At least on desktop I can use extensions to block or remove features I don't want; with the app you're just stuck with what they give you.",1
"it's a bit controversial whether it's good or bad. yes it keeps you connected with loved ones. there are other apps to do that also. sites like this make it so much easier for you to be put in harms way, bullied, stalked, hacked... I have it to be able to talk to my daughter and get an occasional affirmation. otherwise I am against sites like these. I miss back when there was no Facebook or Gmail.",1
Most recent update makes it difficult to use on Galaxy Fold series. Bar for feed/market/friends/etc now on left. Makes front screen prohibitively narrow and hard to read. Bar icons get smashed together after selecting one or the other.,1
"Ever since Meta went down in March/24, I haven't been able to access FB. Whereas, I got on Instagram & threads within hours, I did not on FB. After sending proof of life, I finally I got an access code, only to find out the biggest problem was this app. Planning on uninstalling, then reinstalling to see. If not 🤷🏻‍♀️ I guess it's internet access",1
"I have no regrets of purchasing this Samsung phone. With the exception of not being able to turn my script up so I can read it, it makes it difficult to read my messages and when I write back. If you could show me a way to enlarge my script then this is will be great with the tune up or down?",1
Everything is fine all over world is using fb it means there is no big issue but I'm facing a issue that when every a play a long from videos shortcut which you have given uperside of app it goes for a reel either it's long video or short i ubdated for everytime and a cleared data and cashe also but after 1 time it happens like pervious so check this issue and solve it,1
Recent update making menu down the side of feed has muddled with the menu layout making the front homescreen of fold4 incredibly skinny for viewing and menu icons glitch and gather together in top left corner. It was much better when they were along the top.,1
"On my account when i play one video it only show that one video and below there is msg that ""There are always more videos to watch"".I can't watch more videos.i am facing this problem since 2 years and had try to find every possible solution but can't solve this problem. When i login some other account then it works fine.",1
"I think there was an update or something and now it just continuously blinks like it's reloading itself over and over if I view it on my large internal screen using galaxy z fold,I think it's a 3, seems ok on small outer screen though and yes I tried clearing the cache it didn't help",1
"Love Facebook, but there's always some kind of glitch. This time it says I have a message when I don't. I checked my spam and message requests. I opened every old message thinking something was just left on ""unread."" But nothing seems to be the case. Ever since you updated the code thing for messenger it's been messed up on both my computer and my phone. Not messenger. Facebook. Messenger says I don't have any messages. But when I log into Facebook on my phone and my computer it says I have one",1
I think it is fine but I do not think it should have the right to lock your page shut and lock messenger . It is 2 different apps and should be treated as such . And they need to re evaluate their their restrictions on how they go about putting people on lock down I've been banned from my page quite a few times picture apps a picture apps are horrible this this is the #1 social media outlet what's wrong with that something wrong with that,1
"Hello. I'm facing a very strange problem for pasy few days, when the Facebook app is open a blank pop-up appears again and again on the screen, i tried reinstalling and updating the Facebook but the problem is still there. Thanks.",1
Facebook is good but needs more features. They took away features. I like the concept of inviting others to your lives with ease. Just simply invites. I like longer reel times to be offered. TikTok set the bar high... FB needs improvement.,1
"I am writing to you urgently regarding my Facebook account, which has been hacked. Yesterday, I received a message from a friend prompting me to click on a link, and unfortunately, doing so resulted in someone gaining unauthorized access to my account. They have changed both the email address and phone number associated with the account, effectively locking me out.",1
Since last update...Facebook won't work if I don't allow notifications?! Why should I have to allow notifications and location for the app to even work...I tried the uninstall and re-install avenue and as soon as I hit deny...the app goes crazy...do better.,1
"This app is good but after getting update last year this app lost his soo many options. A few days ago i was rewatching a film called CaptainAmerica, i konw very well this film has a official page on fb then i thought let's share it on fb but when i go to post options in felling and activity area's in watching i search the film name but no official page showup that's i can't share it. As well as this films too, IronMan, Ant-Man, Shang-Chi, GOTG, Invincible, Loki, etc. For this 3 star only.",1
"The last update is terrible and left hand panel disappears, which is so annoying. It needs to be sorted out and rectified. The panel needs to be at the top as it's narrowing the posts so many are not displaying properly.",1
"""Improvement Needed: Inclusive hometown & current City Listings"" ""While Facebook offers a robust platform for connecting people worldwide, there's a glaring issue that needs urgent attention – the city listings.

Don't turn on basic data mode immediately when I am running out of data! If it turn on immediately then it's become very good and usefull app for me. I hope facebook terms will fixt this problem immediately. Thanks facebook terms.,1
"It's a nice app for sure.. But please you guys should fit the issue of friend requests not going through sometimes, it's frustrating. I saw my friend online on the app and I really wanted to send him a friend request so bad but it didn't go through. other than this problem, it's a very cool app",1
"After latest update I did today - on main feed page, usually you can slide down from top of page to get fresh content, posts. However now I keep getting the same things I've already seen over and over again. Very annoying. Did not behave this way before the update.",1
"Facebook has deteriorated in recent years to a point where it is almost unusable. New 'features', added to mimic other social media platforms, are either quirky, annoying or open to abuse making them frustrating for users and administrators alike. Much of the existing functionality has been compromised or simply doesn't work and some settings seem to lose their value spontaneously or don't operate as expected. Meta needs to seriously review / rewrite what is now unstable, unreliable bloatware.",1
"As far as the new update it's good. But I have a problem in viewing videos, when I search some and try to play it, the outcome is reels not the regular video i know of where you can skip and enlarge the video. that's all",1
"I would give this app a higher rating, but whenever looking over the profile feature and I go too fast, I'm temporarily blocked from using that feature. Now, why would the app temporarily block a user who's trying to adjust or improve what they show on their profile by looking through their profile in order to make necessary changes? Fb needs to get its technology for that feature of the app up to par with the user. They mustn't penalize the user for moving ""too fast"". Doing so is absurd.",1
"Marketplace is an algorithm disaster for the end user. FB makes $ on shipped items sold, so even when you sort for local, you'll find some further away items listed before much closer ones. Also, haven't been able to leave feedback for transactions for MONTHS!",1
"UI doesn't render correctly on the Galaxy Fold 4 now. There used to be two different UI formats, one for when you were using the Fold 4 in portrait mode with the large screen closed and one for when the large interior screen was open. Both used to work great but now the portrait mode for the small screen is broken.",1
"instant feedback can be toxic. though, the marketplace is extraordinarily useful. UI is okay, kind of confusing. Privacy to the company doesn't exist, though you can set against the pubilicity of your content. good app, but it needs coding revisions/extensions and policy reform.",1
"My experience with the Facebook app has been excellent. It's user-friendly and helps greatly with online interactions. However, the displayed ads often don't match my preferences, with many online gambling ads and fake accounts. I hope stricter monitoring can be implemented in the future for a more comfortable user experience.",1
It's fun to chat with others and useful to learn things. But the problem for me is the update. Sometime when I open Facebook it says session expired and when I check the update there isn't any update. And when i accidentally leave my account and try to get back in it says error. Fix these problem. Its so annoying. Otherwise it's good.,1
"Every day when I open the app there's a new bug. The back button stops working, the words I type randomly autofill and repeat themselves, the search function can't find posts I just saw that day, marketplace won't allow me to use the search bar, etc... Today the ""love"" and ""like"" buttons have disappeared so I can't react to anybody's posts and the whole app is lagging so hard that I have to scroll and wait to read every sentence. Updating makes no difference. It's been like this for 4 days now.",1
"Hi, currently when installing the app from the play store the ""open links externally"" does not work or is bugged for me atleast. I had to uninstall it and find, download and install an older version of the app, I then enable the setting and it now works as intended. I then updated the app normally through the playstore and the setting is somehow carried over and is now fixed. I don't have to do all of that for the setting to work.",1
"I know this review will probably be ignored but.... Way too many ads, there's ads on your timeline anyway but now ads during most videos, & even more annoying,when the ad finishes the video you've been watching mutes & you have to scroll away from it & then back again for it to un-mute. For the money Facebook is making the product should be flawless. Edit: Now the videos/reels are not autoplaying either (yes it's switched on in my options),C'mon people.",1
I do not have any option to request a review from my buyers. I've met so many nice people and sold a lot of items and still have ZERO reviews. I've searched every where for the option. ITs not in my app. And buyers don't have an option to give me a rating either. Yet I receive requests to review other sellers all the time,1
"I really love this social media app Facebook. But there are some problems while using this. I couldn't watch highlights and featured that my fb friends have posted.

"I'm giving the app 3 stars, app has been great so far until recently my account got locked without any good reason,been tryna unlock it keeps telling me my device isn't recognized and I gotta use a device I've once logged in from took me almost a month to finally unlock, if I ever get locked out of my account for no reason I'm deleting the app .",1
"Not getting all notifications for comments. All notifications are turned on, on the app and in settings on my phone. Also restarted phone. The app is up to data also. Nothing resolves this. Only way to see if anyone has commented on my posts is to go onto my news feed. Facebook please fix this its been going on for too long!!! 😡",1
"After a recent update my "" like"" optionss have completely disappeared. When i click to like something it show a series of blank of white circles. It does the same wen trying to see who has liked a picture. It has been glitching sooo bad.. wen i try to scroll it freezes and lags real bad. I have restarted and reinstall my phone to see if would help and it didn't!! Please HELP",1
"This app is great for communicating via online, it is filled with a lot of fun content and it's easy to use, but lately my account kept logging out on its own without my permission and my saved passwords don't work and I have to keep making new ones, no one else knows the password to my device and I have no other device with my account in it.",1
"always janky, annoying that the news fed doesn't go back farther then a few days and alerts only show for the last few interactions, never seems to be able to load alerts from more then a few days before. feels like it's punishment for not going on the app everyday 🤷",1
"Facebook is fine typically, but since the recent update, it shows up weird on my phone (Fold 4). I have to open to tablet mode and then close it back to the standard screen to be able to view normally.",1
"there are several features that need fixing and improving. such as dating message notifications not showing, or dating chat no working properly (message delays) ; also search filters and sorting options for people search or notifications or Facebook history should be improved. admin assist not even working with given criteria.... those are some of the things I can remember right now",1
"I appreciate Facebook as I've had it for 10 years now. However, with this new update, I can not see any reactions from my statuses. At the same time, I can't react to posts as they just show a gray circle instead of the reaction. If this could be fixed in the near future, it would be nice. Update: it has also been quite laggy, making it hard to scroll through my feed.",1
"Now a days I don't get the latest notification automatically unless I refresh the notification panel few times. Also I observe auto unfriend issue happened with my profile. I see lot of my old friends are not in my friend list even we don't unfriend each other. Also maximum of my friends don't get my post at their timeline. Even if we have regular interaction. If I post a reel through Instagram and share it in Facebook too, maximum friends can't see that reel in FB.",1
If you are thinking of getting off FB because of the volume of sales ads and trash stuff. Hold your finger anywhere in this post and click ′copy’. Go to your page where it says ‘What's on your mind?’ Tap your finger anywhere in the blank field. Click paste. This upgrades the system. Good bye annoying ads and Hello new and old friends! 👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼 This actually works! I guess we will see.,1
I'm having trouble with my copying & pasting the links of post that I want to share. The links don't turn blue anymore so no one can click on them to go to my shared link. It would be great if that was fixed because that's a Major Feature to maneuver/guild members/friends to shared content or post that I would like for them to see. Hope this is Fixed Soon. I use a Samsung phone & this has been happening to me for almost 2 Weeks Now.,1
"Still sucks that you can't see how many friends you have in a specific country, or make a post in your profile to a specific geographic area. The search for people needs to expand to a country instead of a specific city... The good thing about Facebook: the groups and that it doesn't have that stupid restrictions about the size of an image like Instagram. Overall, 3 stars. Not that anyone cares 😂",1
"been doing Facebook for over 30 years. it really went down hill when Meda purchased it but it might be coming a little back now? they went almost 10 years into my past commitments and penalized me for silly commitments or things out of context. if I never used FB I would not bother but I have a lifetime of pictures on here. they remove past post, block senders or people who originally posted items so you can not see the content any longer. sensorship at its best.",1
"I'm able to navigate the app just fine. However, i wish the FB Dating feature could be a separate thing like they do with messenger and tired of the algorithms going against my filter settings as well as seeing matches who are either in Canada, not verified, scammers, couples looking for 3-somes, limited info, can't see their face/ use a meme, or people begging for adds on snapchat/ instagram. Lastly wish i can see more of my friends FB posts instead of reels and ads🙄 Please do better Facebook.",1
don't really use it to much anymore. has turned into just a way to clutter#$&# my news feed with ads and all these suggestions. can't stand it personally. used to love this app but only on it now maybe once a week for just a few minutes if that,1
"It's Facebook and it works. Until it doesn't. I have had one profile for over a decade and suddenly it said ""session expired. Please log in again"" and it never let me log back in. So I made a new page for the same thing to happen again. I'm trying one last time.",1
"I'm having fun on the app again. Lots of things have been fixed. However, as a creator, it's very tedious and time-consuming to have to invite every person who likes your posts 1 at a time. Why not an invite all button? I know the business suite has it, so why can't personal professional pages have it too.",1
It's a good app to connect with family ... childhood friend etc....but it's my request to FB team ..plz make a option for👉1. No one can massage without permission 👉2. Stop audio and video call ... It's really became very irritating & disturbing especially for females...,1
"Frustrated! Up until a few days ago, I was able to scroll thru my notifications back thru days that have passed. Now, there is a gray scrolling bar and it only let's me go so far???? What happened? Did I miss something? I've wasted more time trying to figure out if there is a way to change this and of course the customer service, or lack there of, for FB is invisible.",1
"The Android compatibility of your app has significantly worsened in the past two years since it stopped supporting Android 4 up to Android 10. This is frustrating because now, not everyone can access the app. This creates limitations, with only those on Android 11 to 14 able to use it, and not everyone has updated to Android 13 or 14 yet. While I'm fortunate to have an Android 12 phone, what about others?",1
"FB is a great way to share travels and experiences with your friends and family without having to contact everyone separately. Now, if FB could stop shoving garbage down your throat (unsolicited topics, i.e. sports, advertisements) when you continuously tell them you're not interested. Their algorithms are broken!!",1
I have a Galaxy fold 5 and after the last recent app update the app runs terrible on the front screen it makes everything tiny I have to open the phone to the big screen then close it again for app to operate as intended it's really annoying,1
Still no dark mode! God knows how long ago it dissapeard on my tablet. Tried everything but it won't re-appear! The developers obviously don't have the brains to fix it! I'll give it another couple of weeks and if no joy I'll uninstall. There's plenty of rival apps that have no problems getting the basics right!,1
"The app was great, till it started to have ""bug"" ? The ""story archive"" button as well as the ""Featured"" suddenly disappeared. Its been this for months and with complains and delete-redownloading of app, still no changes. I hope you look into this issue and fix it..",1
"Too many bugs, especially the profiles function. I'm really impressed by the 'switching profile' function and it's really helpful to me. However, there are so many bugs relating to that function. I really hope the devs can improve it soon.",1
"Mainly use this app for it's events page. But it's a pain in the a*s to use 🥲. When i search by text, i get results from all around the world... And if i want to fill in a location, i can only search by city! So if i want to find a local event by name, i'd have to search trough every single city, one by one 😭.",1
"For over a year now, I've tried to report the issue without any response, but I'm not receiving any push notifications to my phone. I've sent screenshots to show that ALL of my permissions and notification settings in my phone and within the app are turned on. Please help!!",1
"Been great for 16 years, but today, a few of my friends are using Facebook Dating supposedly found under menu, but it does not appear there for me. Tried everything from uninstalling the app to following some of the options Google has suggested. Still, nothing is working. My roommate is enjoying the app but I can't see it. I have a Galaxy S22 plus. HELP!!",1
"I'm editing my review to drop it by 1 star. I submitted 2 reports of my issues I've been having, and no one has gotten back to me. Reaction notifications are not showing up in the app for me anymore on one of my accounts. I have tried everything I can think of to fix this in the last 24 hours, and nothing is working. According to reddit, this has been an issue that has happened to people on and off for about 2 years now, and nothing is ever done to fix it.",1
"The most recent update completely changed the ""watch"" short video section. I tried going to settings but it doesn't change anything. Half the videos won't play and the ones that do automatically play with sound even though I set it not to.",1
"This app isn't as good as it used to be, way too many ads I barely seen any of my friends posts anymore. Then I see it days later which is no good. Been using Facebook since around 08 mostly for keeping in touch with family but half don't use it anymore and for sharing pictures. Use this more as I don't like X (twitter) much",1
"Unusual token expiration. I went to open Facebook today to wish others happy birthday as my daily routine, but today I was met with the log in screen. My credentials are correct but I get an error when trying to log in. If I select forgot password, input my mobile, then continue to my account, I'm also getting an error there too. I can send screenshots if the admin responds. I've had no other issues with Facebook other than political for 10+ years.",1
"Update on post are still delayed in app. Can't add music to post. The emojis and stickers need to be updated and scroll line more visible. Avatar needs better lifestyle look options and activity actions Notifications are not as specific as marked.

Need better task bar with more options to create better stories like possible voiceover, page adjustments multiple photo option",1
"Links will not open in my browser even after checking multiple times to be sure it is enabled, they only open in facebook. A marketplace chat is in my messenger list now and cannot be deleted or removed. I never had these issues before the most recent update",1
"I don't usually have issues with Facebook until today. I don't know what's going on but it keeps saying my session has expired and logging me out as soon as I log in, updating the app and restarting my phone didn't work and I can't delete the app so if yall could fix this that'd be great 🙃",1
It's been alright for a while but recently I believe they removed the option to have ur avatar as ur cover photo. I hardly use the avatar as it is now I don't see a point in updates his looks to match mine if I can't have him displayed? Just some features they've added to match other medias that aren't necessarily an extremely used part of their app,1

"It's nice to connect with friends and family.. but don't get locked out! I was locked out for 2 months no warning no nothing on what I could've done to get locked out! Googled and did everything you could find to get back in and finally somehow managed to get a text back to do so . smh missed it, but didn't lol but glad to be back.. I 🤔 think",1
Fb and messenger is constantly glitching. there's no one to contact for trouble shooting issues. I had a profile hacked and locked for 3 years even though I never went against community standards and the profile was hacked and reported as hacked. I only keep it to keep in touch with family and because I don't use tik tok so I use it to watch reels.,1
"not too crazy about my ""device info"" just being readily accessible to any & all. I mean, folks on my Friends List knowing & having access to this is fine by me. But if someone that Ive recently declined a Friend Request from, can link onto my page from a mutual friend's, if they too have the same access to that same device info &or location info (which is usually on top of the list of device info), then this scenario is MORE THAN POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC.I'D SAY IT IS PROBABLY PROBLEMATIC, No??",1
"Oh dear, I usually enjoy Facebook and post 6 days a week on two profiles. But since whatever that issue was on Tuesday 05/03/2024 around 3pm in the UK, when it logged me out, I cannot get back in. Not good... I've reported it but thought I'd mention it here too. I don't feel a lot of my friends interact on Facebook anymore. Unless my settings etc have just prioritised ads and celeb pages I follow, rather than us members of the public. I'll have to look at friends' content, once I get access.",1
Videos either are click bate or do not play. The same with some of the stories. It seems that you click on something to read and either there are disgusting pictures of aliments or nothing to do with the intro. And now the pages will not load. Not very social.,1
I think Facebook is great for connecting with people and sharing stories. That's a good way to stay in touch with people that live far away. I also think their algorithm is so out of control people get in trouble for reposting stuff they literally found on Facebook. I wish you could look into the content of the post instead of just flagging words...,1
"Since Meta took over there have been several crashes that hurt facebook and insta. interface sometimes runs slow and when you read an article Facebook will refresh, kick you out and reset your homescreen losing the article. Not a fan of having to set up extra extra security on messenger either.",1
"I mean it's hard to compare it with anything else, but just on a quality front, a media format that works one decade, can suddenly stopped working another. Some of my videos from 10 years ago suddenly have no sound.",1
Today I tried logging into my Facebook and it told me the session was expired. Even after multiple attempts it said the same thing. Not sure if it is a server issue or not but I've had no issues with logging in before. My username and password is correct.,1
you learn to use the app. you think you're doing pretty good with it. then they change it again and all that time you spent organizing your friends into game groups or church groups or coping groups somehow. vanishes and you're stuck with the whole list of thousands of friends with no structure. yea. fun.,1
i love Facebook. I only have one challenge that has left a bad taste in my mouth. I have another account that I can't gain access because someone set up a 2 Layer Authentication on it and there's no one I can contact to help me. I've had the account for many years and had to start all over again while having to abandon my resources and contacts. There needs to be a way for people to be able to get things like that reversed when you can prove you're the owner of the account.,1
"Hi! Working just fine. Im using an android phone, the haptic feedback when scrolling through the navigation bar annoys me. I've already turned off the haptic feedback on my whole phone however, I still don't know why there's still a haptic feedback whenever I scroll through the navigation bar, can you help me?",1
"Overall good until this year. It said session expired so i was prolly clicking on things a bit too much. I tried logging back in. That didnt work, i cleared cache, force stopped it. Uninstalled it and everything. Nothing worked. I hope for you all to fix this so i can continue chatting and going through social media. Thank you",1
Suddenly this app no longer allows me to record using landscape mode. For whatever reason Facebook has changed its settings and I now get a message that says landscape not supported. This means that i now must record live using portrait which is totally inadequate.,1
"Been at least 2 months of the feed only loading a few posts half the time, and I miss maaany notifications.. I tried updating, reinstalling (It doesn't happen on the browser version) Hope it's fixed soon. No point in keeping an app that doesn't work.",1
It's having issues picking up recently created photos and videos. I had to restart my phone to get it to select the file i wanted to share. As of right now it has gotten worse. You stupidheads at meta NEED to fix this ASAP. It is making your platform a bad nightmare to use,1
"I love how FB helps you keep in contact with your loved ones and friends and even find people you've lost contact with. I'm not a fan of how it's turning into a content creator space. That takes away from the genuine aspect of communicating with my community through the platform imo. I don't want to be encouraged to add strangers to a place where I communicate with my family and friends bc ""I need to get my followers up to monetize.""",1
This application giving me a awesome experience. But sometime it’s showing some technical promlems like when i enter to the content watching menu then ta bar get upper of the content when i refresh the app it become ok. Otherwise it’s a best application.,1
"Typically, there are more adds than updates from friends, and when I get updates from friends, they are from the same friends over and over instead of cycling through friends. But I keep coming back because the algorithm is addictive and hits all the dopamine centers, which I know is horrible and disgusting, and yet I can't stop.",1
"hello, meta! good evening. i just want to ask why does the new features isn't in my account yet?? i've updated the app and all since the last time but i haven't experienced and use the new features at all. such as the music in the comments or the switch accounts without really building a new acc. i hope you fix it if you have time. i really love to use those. thank you so much! <33",1
I've been using Facebook for who knows how long now and I'd say that it'd really helped me stay connected with people I know. There are issues you might want to consider checking though... Some pages that was created long ago don't have complete identical features as to what pages are at present. Here's what I can name: 1. Can't provide admin access to another user for my Page. Facebook has been beautiful so far. Please continue being so in the future :>,1
"I tried to create a page but Facebook doesn't allow me, saying that I've recently created too many pages. False! I've never created a single page on FB before. Also, all the recent updates are buggy. What's the point of these constant updates when bugs and glitches are all we get from them?",1
"I can no longer react with anything but a like to all the pictures. The rest of the reactions appear as a small blank dot and I can't press on them. That's annoying. It works fine on the website, but my expectation is it works as well on the app.",1
"Every time there is an update m, it seems like the app doesn't properly work anymore. Whatever changes they are making are affecting us In a major way. I know that change is inevitable but it shouldn't affect the performance of the app, but yet it does every time",1
"I have been using Facebook app to go live on one of my pages. Recently I learned that with the latest version of the app, landscape mode is not supported so I had to downgrade the version to use this feature. It's been hectic tackling this issue. Kindly do something about it.",1
"Facebook is a cool space to communicate, possibly make new friends, read, and see things that you may never see in your own life that people do. It is an outlet for me. The only thing that perturbs me is they flagged my account several times in 2023 for innocent things posted 3yrs prior. I couldn't plead my case. The algorithms suck & the way to get paid if using it that way is tiresome. I feel like they pick favorites to whom they show on the timelines. But cool for everyday use.",1
"Everytime i search my favorite songs in >my story or create story,< there is only some recomemded songs that i dont even know, and when i search every songs i like, it doesnt appear, and the favorite music button is gone even i have a strong wifi connection. And sometimes when i comment, my keypad is errorring sometimes even when i tap the 'hiiiii' word in comment for example, when i posted the comment, instead of the word >hiiii< appears, its only 'iii' PLS FIX THIS BUG 😓😣🥺🩵",1
"Can you create a switch button for page regions on mobile app .. cause i have a problem with it, when i follow a page it sends me to the UK server while the Algerian one is available.. (i don't use vpn by the way). I tried to switch it using web browser from pc but it doesn't work... i think there is a glitch or something like that 🤔",1
All I want to watch is videos! I don't want reels when I click on a video this is not TikTok!!! I was worried that the system shut down will affect Facebook it did!! Now I can't watch my favorite cooking videos! Even if I do. I know the content will not be of the same group or be something completely different,1
"FB is a great reference for contacting family, friends (past & present) & advertising. I'm happy with it, except, the fact that my Market Place acct was used to scam & I lost the account. I tried contacting FB to explain & retrieve my MP account back. There no contact with humans to negotiate or settle problems in order to keep your account. Their AI system only gives certain options, that are not in your favor, to settle issues & retain your account. Their decision is final. No exception.",1
"This is a very good app. But a problem has arisen here since some time, which is that our ID is being automatically deleted from Facebook. What is the reason for this? This makes us suspect that the ID may have been corrupted. Which is basically the uproar. I hope you will solve this problem very soon. Thank you 🙏",1
"The mobile app is fine. Facebook has problems with notifications leading back to conversations. I don't want to look for my comment everytime I return to a post! No other website, tube, insta, etc. has this problem.",1
"I've been using Facebook for almost two decades and throughout all the iterations this one seems to be the most functional. As a medium of our free speech, it's leaves more to be wanted.",1
Latest update has bugs! Don't do it! My like button no longer gives me all the options. Switching from personal to business pages isn't staying on the page I'm trying to get to or the app freezes.,1
mostly the app is great but recently has been asking me to log back on after visiting Instagram and even more recently asking for 2step verification but never sending link to email. I find this really anxiety provoking as I have multiple friends whose FB accounts have been hacked and they have lost all access to their account,1
"Overall, it's a good social media platform in the sense it provides a lot of variety of forms of communications, but I dont't like the fact their ad-based approach, where you're constantly bombarded with irrelevant ads.",1
"I don't know how it happened?I can't see the video bar on my account, I can only watch one video and then the videos don't load anymore.I've tried all kinds of ways, log in, log out, restart, I've tried everything and it still doesn't appear.I don't hide the video on Facebook.",1
Too. Many. Ads. The video ads that interrupt are the worst. Won't bother watching the rest of the video when that happens. You want more revenue? Fire your marketing team for thinking the only path forward is intrusive ad placement. They're myopic at their jobs at best.,1
"Great for finding old friends & seldom speaking relatives. It's REALLY bad at playing police with posts that have zero bad or offensive getting you dinked, I got several for supposedly seeking likes. It was the word 'done' on an author giveaway contest. Seriously, they took away my Supernatural fan page for my responses to contests. Yet inappropriate pages and profiles abound! Also, if you're not liberal, your posts will be removed. The number of ads in my feed is about 30%. 3.5 stars rating.",1
Overall I'm still happy with Facebook for the most part. The sponsored ads are a bit much. Once you engage to one you get flooded heavily. I'd like to have better access to my albums. Not sure if they've been taken hostage because you can not do anything with them but see them. All in all I gave a 3 for resurrection power! 😁🙏,1
I am constantly frustrated with the navigation button being placed up and down. I'm more used for the navigation button set at the button but every now and then it goes at the top. Please add a feature where we can edit where to place the navigation button. That would be helpful,1
"I mainly use Facebook as a big photo album. Lately in the app it won't let me share my own photos in my albums when I'm going through memory lane. That needs to be fixed. And now I can only like posts, all the reaction options are blank.",1
"Dear Facebook coders, the search people function needs worked on. There are several instances I've searched someone's name(from Facebook dating) so the name is correct and typed in current city and the city where they're from. This info is clearly on there dating profile which shows the info searched is correct, but when searching they're not in either location. The code clearly needs cleaned up or redone. Wanted to bring this to your attention, best regards, -Matthew-",1
"I have a z fold 4, when I fold it open, Facebook opens as it should in tablet mode. But when I close it, fb still opens in tablet mode. It's really annoying to have to force stop it or clear cache all the time",1
Not sure if it's the app version or what but pictures won't auto rotate when you go from holding your phone upright to holding it horizontal. And yes I have the auto rotate function selected on my phone. Galaxy S23 Ultra,1
"Edit for new complaints, since there's no way to give specific feedback anywhere else anymore. I absolutely hate having inane comments pop up over the caption on reels. If I want to read comments, I'll read them but I don't need them shoved at me. Notifications for comments/replies still fail half the time to actually show me the comment, and I have to search for it. This new update also has many reels failing to play.",1
Facebook has turned into a place for nothing but people scamming others in one form or another. It's hard to enjoy it anymore. I've seriously considered deleting my account. I probably would if it weren't for the fact that I have family on there. I still love all the funny stuff that's posted though. Could do without all the nudity on there now. Facebook needs a complete overhaul. It's gotten way out of hand if you ask me!,1
"I have been using Facebook since 2015, and it has been a great journey so far. However, I recently encountered an issue while watching reels on Facebook. When I liked a particular reel, the like button would get stuck on that reel. This problem has been persistently affecting me, and it has become quite annoying. I kindly request the Facebook team to look into this issue and provide a resolution.",1
I've purchased a total of 66 Android devices all being controlled 100% of the time by Google services as well as G-mail email involvement also with each new device... I never suspected nor was I aware that I wasn't in complete control of how my devices fuctioned until the year 2018 and it was suddenly clear my decisions were being chosen for me with options each of which were more unclear and destructive making my life worse and more difficult. I have been forced everyday to react in a severe to,1
My facebook timeline/page is showing no posts. I uninstalled it and reinstalled and still nothing. I'm getting a bit fed up with it not being able to see things on my page.,1
3 stars for 2 reasons 1. One time my f.b. got hacked and the hacker deleted my entire profile PERMANENTLY and I never could recover it . I lost SO many important photos and memories. 2. Another time someone hacked my fb and hit up my entire friend's list for money acting like they are ME AND DOZENS OF PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED IT INCLUDING ME BUT I STILL CANT AVVESS IT AND THE HACKER IS STILL AT LARGE and still scamming and harassing my friends list for money . good for staying connected tho.,1
three staring this till they fix the issue with fold devices from the latest update. device always starts in innerdisplay mode and won't go back to the normal outter display until you open and close the device.,1
"The Additional profiles in this facebook, its irritating. I'm sorry for the words. But it's been almost 2 and a half month when I created this yet I still can't change my Additional's profile name. Please fix this.",1
"Some features work in a very strange way... I first thought it might be my cellphone or even my account, but I've tried in two different cellphones and is still the same. I love FB but it really needs to improve",1
Screen keeps flashing on my Galaxy Z Fold 4. Facebook tells me to shake my phone which does nothing. I have to uninstall & reinstall. It then works okay for a short while then starts flashing again. Facebook is no help at all!,1
Sucking more and more. Now glitchy and bloated. Often wont show more than a few item when scrolling. Happens across all my android devides and other family members devices with totally different accounts,1
I love using Facebook it helps me to keep connected with friends and family but Facebook needs to make it's UI better by making it less cluttery and reducing the icon of story (it is too large) it must be smaller. Also it should show less suggested posts on home page. PLEASE TAKE THIS ADVICE,1
Facebook app sucks! Notifications are always a day late and when I click on them it never takes me to the post or video. Too many ads and posts I don't want to see. I'll stick with YouTube.,1
"Nice for the most part, but no way to get help when something goes wrong. Facebook policies require people to have multiple accounts. Even switching daily causes Facebook to think I'm being hacked. If they would store my MAC address, they would see that everything is between 3 or 4 devices.",1
"Sincr I have update, Every time I try to watch a video it does not play I have to save it then go to saved list to watch it. Right now even my saved list is not opening. Could you please fix it thank you.",1
"Preferred it when fb, moments and messenger was connected as one app. You can not log out of messenger constantly running sucks up my data and data speeds. Government has got their paws on everything.",1
"Why did Facebook change the navigation bar to the left and not on the top as in the previous version? Cant change it back to the top, it is cropping all the pictures and feeds",1
"Ever since the last update on my device, about the middle of march, I haven't been able to see what the reactions to my posts were. It's just a blank circle. No way of telling what is what, even when I go to laugh face emotion at something just blank circles for the whole row.",1
My chats aren't loading with my friends. I've tried restarting the app and checking for an update. Neither of which worked. But other than that it's been fun so far.,1
Well Facebook is a good app to get connected with social media...but since few days I'm facing a problem that I'm unable to see my no. of followers.. like I'm able to see all the profiles of those who follows me but I want to see the no. of people.. Please take a step over it...,1
"Is this only happening to me? When there are post with some violent pictures, it was covered and cannot see unless you choose to uncover it, im aware of that But when i try to uncover that said image with possible violent content. Is doesn't do anything. It still blocked.",1
App has bugs. Reels menu tab keeps flowing with downward flow swipe. Now videos tab opens reels only and videos are gone. Privacy setting arent great and not simple either.,1
"I've had a ton of technical issues and my personal information has been leaked. on top of that, my husband's FB page is not his page it is my page and they're not helping me resolving that issue. He is dead and they're important family memories on that page",1
"Not a fan of the latest update. Not everyone wants to use the AI feature. Also, it's not showing post reactions correctly. Tempted to delete altogether.",1
I'm giving this 3 stars because on the new Samsung UI 6 update it refreshes every 3 seconds. You can get inside the comments section and when you get out there's a whole new feed . It's very frustrating.,1
"The latest update where my widgets for news feed , market place, and videos and notifications are now all down the left side of my screen they glitch out into 1 location and it makes my newsreel 30% narrower on my phone screen. How do I change it back",1
"To many ads, only interested in what's happening with friends and family. Very tired of constantly receiving wanting you to join their group. Takes a lot of time to delete and stay deleted.",1
"I love the old FB, where not too many restrictions, where I can find something new, not the one that ""manufactured"" because of my previous actions or searches. FB now become too commercialized.",1
"Often more problems than it is worth. You can't edit half the time, and a host of other issues that just piss me off for having it on a top tier phone.",1
"Still my go-to app for small businesses and keeping up with friends. Lately, I'm not receiving in-app notifications; not push notifications, I'm talking about the little bell at the top of my feed; and seeing others complaining about the same thing. What's up FB?",1
"I give it a three. Because, the application users still need to modify, go to the settings then adapt to the quality of posts. Most new users are not even able to navigate the settings and causes them mental health problems. Posts of the news feed are most usually alienating from real society in its past-present and the humor causes possible and continued recreation. If you want to continue connecting people via internet, maybe it's time to reflect. Maybe social isn't what is u's to be.",1
it's an alright app security wise and the games also market place. But Facebook going back too like 09 and then you getting in trouble for something you even forgot existed is not alright. Or posting a meme or leaving a comment that was taken in the wrong context is really annoying. If it wasn't for family and friends plus the games and market place I wouldn't be on this platform,1
"this app has come along way some good an some not so good lol.. my only issue is I have a page an a lot of memories on it I would love to have back, an I can't replace because a lot of the photos are no longer available . so because I don't use that email an number any more I can't retrieve a new password . ,, 😭 I can prove with out a dought I am who I say I am but they still won't help me .. I hope someone that sees this knows a way to help me retrieve my original page .. 😔😇👪🥰",1
Not a big fan of the new updates where the task bar sit on the left side row. It glitches out and I can't change the screen from home to profile nor market place etc. The old one was better where it doesn't glitch out where all the icons would be in one spot,1
"Currently, when I am scrolling through reels, like ever 5 scrolls it will do a continue scrolls and skip like fives videos and I will have to swipe back to view those reels if I feel the need. I will scroll back and then continue scrolling one by one and then again on like the 5 or so video when I go to scroll, it will swipe past at least 5 videos.",1

I stay in touch with distant friends and family but to do so requires wading through so many ads that my frustration grows. Likewise, in general, I mistrust social media more daily and am reluctant to partcipate lest my life be invaded more than it already is. It was fun at first but no more.",1

For the most part it's ok. But marketplace gives me problems. Either it says something I posted is a knock off when I bought it from the store and still has tags keeps threatening to ban me from marketplace. Also it doesn't give me the option to purchase and ship I have to uninstall and then reinstall the app for the function to be available.,1

"There is a function that isn't working only with my phone. All my family members have the same phone model (S22 ultra), and for some reason, mine is just not working when I try to share a video with the ""quick share to messenger"". I click on their picture, and nothing happens. Apparently, it is supposed to take me to another menu where I choose to send it separately or not, but that window never pops. So, I have pointless icons when sharing reels.",2
"Recently annoyed with the latest update. You can't pause on a certain part in reels, it just shows you the first frame high is super annoying. And I can't read comments easily anymore because my keyboard keeps popping up and then going down, then popping up again. When I hit the button to make it go away, the keyboard just pops up five seconds later. Fix it 🙄",2
"I'm reading in ""reviews"" here that other people are having a tough time with the app. I'm not, AT THIS TIME, seemingly having the same issues but..I know there are CONSTANT updates to all apps. Do you have a newer phone? I saw an app that in disguise is a hacker app. They can take over your phone and use a mouse and on their laptop to operate and change settings and shut off the app and can use it in the background as well. Look for any odd hidden apps. Uni stall them. Shut phn off a while. Rest",2
"It's a good app, but I've been getting this error message popping up on the dating part of the app recently. Every time I edit my interests, it says that an unexpected error occurred, then I tap retry, but it displays a blank page & I close & reopen the app. They updated it yesterday, but this error still exists, even after reinstalling the app. The other things seem to be working fine & it's a good FB app overall... 👍🏻😇",2
I love and hate Facebook in general as I do most social apps. mostly because of the ads and humans being humans. seeing awesome art and things are the highlight. As for the app itself? It could be better. Birthday messages are limited. I can't use my own images. I see more ads than friends posts. I haven't been in it lately due to being busy so my.feed has dwindled into boring. It is probably for the best since I should get back to work.,2
"This platform is wonderful for me. I get to see pictures of family & friends that otherwise obviously I wouldn't be able to see. I am disabled with several issues. No.1 is due to strange noise in my head all of the time along with Tinnitus, Hyperacusis and Trigeminal Neuralgia from Chloroform burn in 2002. That is just a few. These issues keep me homebound & unable to be on the. phone at all most of the time. Thank you Facebook!!",2
"I like the app overall even though it keeps updating all the time but my main issue is you can't share your listings from the Marketplace into other groups. It has been an option from time to time but it's pretty annoying for people who sell a bunch of stuff on Facebook Marketplace. There have been issues that come and go but they are quickly fixed, typically I just check if it needs to be updated when I have an issue and it needs to be updated.",2
"Facebook is a nice place to keep up w/activities, events in your area as well as from a far. I especially like the ability to communicate with & see family & friends that are long distance. I would like to see: * better tools to edit live videos while being live rather than having to use a 3rd party system. * Make it easier to quote free music while doing a live without getting flagged because it is quoted in the description and/or in the comments. * To easily select & delete Notifications+",2
Editing to say it can now be moved to external storage card ... I would love it more if I could move it to external storage (SD card) ... my internal storage is maxed out with all the apps that want to sit there rather than slide over. I have to delete and reinstall apps when I was to use one or the other. Please next update create that option to move to external. Thank you,2
"I really feel that you guys should make our photos easier to scroll through and find. Like an option to sort by dates and/or years... Like Iphones do. I find myself trying to find photos often and the design is just horrible to do that. I really feel strongly about this feature!! Also, it would be cool to be able to say: ""Hey let me see what I posted in 2016 in October!"", and then be able to easily search that time frame. I really feel this feature is a MUST. Doooo it.",2
"The only problem that I have is the live function. It doesn't rotate like it should. I'm a musician going live at every event that I play and when I go live, normally, the entire screen rotates to landscape. Currently, I still record landscape, but when I want to rewatch the footage, I have to turn off auto rotation on my phone and I despise doing that.",2
"I can say for the most part I experienced good service, met a lot of interesting people and learned technical skills in the mean time. My problems that I endure are I can never retrieve lost texts or messages that will disappear in the middle of me writing the sentence. I don't know where to address the issue, or what Google device or app I should look into. Very confusing.",2
"FB does a lot of things great and is user friendly. Posts, pictures, edits, shares, finding friends -- all easy. And lots to do: posts, groups, marketplace. There is one irritation: when I get a group notification highlighting a particular post and click on that, it just takes me to the group, not the post. Sometimes it's 2-4 down from the top, sometimes I give up before I find it. Everything else is pretty good. Watch out for scammers, but that's on us individually.",2
"Facebook in its simple form is fun for keeping up with friends, news, events and memes. It isn't always the most up-to-date platform because post diffusion is limited by engagement, but it is a really easy way to find quick entertainment if you have a few minutes. It still allows relatively long form written submissions in notes. It is riddled with ads though and scams are not uncommon. Facebook offers detailed security preferences and can help launch your business idea with a page.",2
"AD IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTION- I see so many ads that I want to save for later so I can actually purchase the product, BUT there's no way for me to save the reel. I would love to be able to save reels for advertisement just as I can save normal reels, otherwise I kinda forget about the product and have to search for it later on. Would be SO helpful for your advertisers and you could probably charge more based on having this feature.",2
"Greetings, I wanted to bring to your attention an issue regarding video playback on Facebook. When attempting to view shared videos, there seems to be a redirection problem. Instead of playing the intended video, random videos are being played instead. This renders the feature significantly less useful than intended. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Thanks",2
"In general, I have never been an active user of FB and cannot speak about its all the functionality, but over the last few months I have been actively using the marketplace as a seller. I was very surprised at how buggy and inconsistent the Ul and UX are. It seems that once upon a time something was programmed there and abandoned.",2
"It's extremely hard to understand it now compared to how it used to be. There's so many different features that seem superfluous and I can't always differentiate between them. For example, there's posting on my wall, posting to my photo album, posting a ""story"" whatever the hell that is and posting a memory. Then there are the Reels, I don't know anything about those, whether it's people I'm following that post those or where they come from. I wish fb would give all its features more clarity.",2
"Facebook undoubtedly provides ease of communication and connection for various purposes,feature rich across age brackets and also avenues for business solutions.The only drawback is performance of its monitoring programs on user activities. Edit:I have been unable to install the app after an update from Play store,it has happened a couple of times,any assistance is appreciated",2
"So for using Facebook is a fantastic experience. however, there is an issue from last couple of months that, whenever I play a video, it is in a reel form and i cannot make its speed increased or decreased and i have to watch the whole video which is very time wasting and annoying too.",2
"I just don't like the auto play on every video and ad in the app. Can y'all fix it, we should be the ones to turn on the videos and its sound when we want to or not. And Facebook, please bring back the sticker post version, I really loved uploading posts with stickers.",2
"Ridiculous application in front of me. It shows useless ads. every now and then and also while watching an important video. Don't we have the value of time?? For earing some bucks, facebook is promoting such rediculous ads. If this doesn't fix then I'm going to discontinue using facebook. Facebook should give the full control to it's user regarding ads watching",2
"Excellent uptime. the platform is amazing. There are small glitches at times, but normally don't last for long. Recently, the videos would freeze when you switch the view from feed tab to videos tab",2
Dark mode seems to have broken in the recent update. Color of new notifications makes them impossible to read. Wished there was an option to open links in default browser rather than the built-in one. Seems they have removed such option.,2
I think Facebook is pretty fun to use it has its issues like any other app the one thing I've been having problems with is when I click on the app it wants me to put my email and password in this has been going on for weeks now I've tried to install it reinstalled it and nothing seems to work it will be fixed and then it would disappear I have to put my email and password again I hope they get this fixed soon cuz it is aggravating,2
"whenever i try to click pages, reels, to see who reacted, and i try to go back with the arrow button, it always sends me to my device settings, i hope this can be fixed. edit: it is fixed now, great work Facebook.",2
"Everyone knows Facebook, what more can I say. but I don't like the fact that I can't see my pictures that I uploaded since 2008 when I joined Facebook, that was the reason most of us posted or uploaded them, with the hope that even if our phones gets bad or something we can always have access to our pictures and posts. now it's only when Facebook gives you memories that you can see those things.",2
"Dear Developer, Greeting! I just want to ask, Suggestion regarding the position of home icon, profile, notification, video to pla... These five icons appear on the top page. To suggest that it will be better be on the lower or bottom part for Android user. Due to defficulty of tapping upper part. It's just a suggestion. Hoping it wll find solution soon. Thank you so much. More power! Now the position of the said suggested icons was again back to its style 😢",2
"Facebook is now notifying me of pages that I follow on my phone, but I'm not sure how to receive specific feed posts on the app. I'm interacting with groups and people who have questions about games TV shows and their favorite things to watch, so everything is working fine, but I guess the meta AI is new on the app so I can use it to search for a specific Facebook page and group that I can't find",2
"It's far from perfect but overall it'd a decent app for a decent social media company. In my opinion, the desktop version is much better! If you ever get the chance to use it on a laptop or computer, you should check it out. Runs much smoother to.",2
"For those complaining about the messed up layout on Fold phones, .. Just change the font size on your phone until it auto adjusts so the menu moves back to the top!!! It drove me NUTS now, I'm back in business.",2
"Facebook has helped me stay connected with friends and family, find groups of be able to talk to. overall I like it. a few times Facebook's AI detection has stopped my post for potentially harmful content, which I would never post. good intentioned and usually works. annoying when it doesn't.",2
"If you use it correctly, it's really help you. But if you miss use it's can drain you. I want to draw a attantion to FACEBOOK please block the fake accounts , and block that accounts which are not used minimum 8 to 10 years . Thank you so much for the progressive journey 🙂.",2
"this app is fantastic and it's very amazing. You can explore another divisions and come across all the beautiful things and places that you never been before. My suggestion is you need to address any issues and fix all the problems immediately such as violations against community standards, explicit content or videos etc.",2
"Very nice breakfast spot. Charming little spot. Decor is comforting. The food was really good and the pricing was about average. They have a bite of food for almost any type of diet as well, Vegetarians will not be disappointed. There are too many items to list, but they have shrimp and grits, country platter, chicken, and waffles, just to name a few. if u are in the area, please stop by and have a bite. Well worth it!",2
"I'd give it a 5 but s8nce the pictures don't rotate to landscape anymore it's not worthy of 5 stars. All MT settings on the phone say rotate, and in other apps the pictures will rotate to landscape but Facebook? Nope. it's been like this for awhile and lots of people complaining but no response from Zuckerberg and company. SMH 👎",2
can Facebook page be a little bit easy to have vice call and video call in their future updates. if it be it will have a wonderful change in their future face. thanks for your great help to knowing the ideas of users. in my opinion the Facebook have a bright future just needs some changes that's it. I have a lot's of ideas about that like can Facebook have some games in it for kids or young ages as part of Facebook application in my opinion it can also helps to develop and be a good rise to user,2
"I have always enjoyed the dances for the music even though I was familiar w dance steps from the 80s. but I'm looking to make new friends there, and the people in charge were always friendly and polite. ♥️🤠🐴🐎👍💜",2
"The Task bar (ribbon) is displayed vertically on left side of screen on Samsung Fold phones. There is no way to change the ribbon location in Settings. Because or this, half of Stories & Pics are not displayed.",2
"its much better now. keeping moderation up cant be easy but im glad to see less smutty spammers lately, i like it connecting with friends an family and current events but i would suggest monitizing things like Temu adds as i find popular adds often tend to carry scam an hacker links in disguise. Rock on and thanks for being diligent.",2
Great app and it does everything I could wish for but it still does not have a bottom navigation bar like on iOS. I struggle to reach the top of the screen sometimes and so if this could be added it would be greatly appreciated as I'm sure others have the same problems too.,2
"Music under About Info won't load saved music list. Some but not all songs will not add to said list. Error message occurs. ""Something went wrong. Please try again."" when trying to load list. ""Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again."" when trying to add songs (not songs that are already added but new music)",2
"Awesome and user friendly. There's a big perplexing issue that has lingered far too long and attempts hasn't been made to update it. Fix the landscape issue on Livestream. It has been disabled to only landscape. This is frustrating cos we deeply enjoyed it to living programmes. Facebook, please fix this asap God bless",2
"The earlier versions of the Facebook app were great. It's awesome to be in touch with friends and family from all around the world. I've had birthday greetings from school pals I last saw 45 years ago and chatted with mates & ex-flatmates from around NZ & further afield. But, sadly, I believe the last two updates made the site unnecessarily complex. I wish they'd stop all the updating and just do what they did do so well. Definitely a case of, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!""",2
"Offers a lot of functionality. There have been meaningful bug fixes and improvements since my last review so I updated it to 4 stars from 2. It still needs better support for older versions of Android, and it still has a lot of annoying bugs, but they are showstoppers.",2
"Been loving the app to keep me updated, but since I updated Facebook I can't seem to do anything else except ""like"" something.. all the other options are just gray circles and I can't see how others reacted either, also it lags once awhile which does get annoying but I do manage that.. I wanna be able to react to posts again.. please fix it!",2
I love FB I use it very regularly. But I have a problem which crept up last week. I deleted a photo which I was trying to upload as my cover picture. Suddenly I find I (including others) cannot see my cover photos. I can still see all my profile pictures by sliding them but not the case with cover pictures. Please help me restore it to what it was.,2
"I have been on Facebook since 2008, lost my account once, and by the help of HS, I got my account back. I have been using it on multiple devices on ONE account, and I have no problem with it. But since Facebook breakdown recently and followed by updates, it doesn't display as usual on one of my device, Samsung Tab S9 Ultra, I don't like the Homepage display vertically, I like it horizontally especially on the 14.2 inches screen. Do something about it please.",2
"Very good app, you can chat with your friends and get to know new people. The only problem I'm having is that random people in groups send a link that leads to inappropriate things. The second I'm having is that I can't chat my BFF, she already unrestricted me and unblocked me, but I still can't text her. Pls fix this problem so I can chat with my friend.",2
Facebook is great for finding people you lost contact with. it's also a great platform to run a small business and promote yourself. The only thing that bothers me is the money that's being charged to boost your page isn't fully explained on paper and there's no one you can contact for customer service. That should definitely change,2
"Facebook I maintaining and updating its content, news feed according to the people's trend and their preferences and fascination which is good 👍. May be high-end data analysis is involved. But I have observed that some below the level content is highlighting and floating (though minimum), which is embarrassing and not expected according to our needs. Hope it will be resolved soon.",2
Great way to keep in touch with friends and share our lives. some great groups you can join for any interest but there are a lot of dodgy profiles and fake accounts. unfortunately I get odd days where there are tons of ads (most I've no interest in) or for things I have never searched for in my life. I wouldn't recommend using marketplace anymore after several people trying to con me out of money and people renting fake flats.,2
"This app was once created for college students. Now it has evolved into a large social media platform that connects family members, long lost friends, as well as gives the opportunity for making new friends. I have old highschool buddies, family & distant family alike. Make new local connections to attend events like live music, wine tasting, panic rooms, pumpkin patches, and more. (not spons lol). There are obviously flaws in the programming & numerous ads appear on the main feed. But I digress",2
"Sometimes it feels me bother. Specially, when I got some commercial advertisements and often it gives us some crucial or adult related scenerio that wasn’t legal for FB authority to approve this kind of post. This phenomenon leads to this app unsocial. Beside that, sometimes it say to me that it might not be responding then, it allows me to choose wait or close this App and often it work very slowly. It waste our time and money.",2
"Facebook is well known & needs no introduction. The one thing that upsets me most about Facebook is that it is so difficult to get back to the same point in a discussion. History of my activities should be readily & easily recalled, and selectively deletable or archivable.",2
"Hello, Meta! First of all, thank you for all the efforts you laid upon this app for social connectivity worldwide. I really appreciate it. I would like to report an issue in your app wherein I experienced a frequent notice of automatic logouts. I have a friend who also experienced this. May I ask for your assistance regarding this matter?",2
"I mean, Facebook is great. Like, really. But there are some instances where, when I spend a lot of time on reels, my facebook account just logged out in itself. I hope that can be fixed. Overall, it's great!",2
"TODAY(March,5,2024), What happened to Facebook. I cannot login to my account and the session has expired. And, I think it was only me but that kind of situation happened to my friends and people who live in Myanmar. Please,do your best not to occur error again. I love to use this app but occuring error once a year is not totally fine.",2
It's good 😊 cos it gives you access to meet people you have their contact during school days ... But I don't like it when people hack your acct easily and you start from the scratch again ...So work on that hacking aspect . I will rate it 5star when it's done,2
"it's a great app , I hope his time the security is top notch I've got hacked about 5 times in he last 3 months unfortunately and I've done everything I can to keep me safe. but easy n love how easy it is to connect to others!!",2
"A very good app for staying connected with many friends. In this app you can enjoy memes, photos and videos. but sometimes the account is restricted without any valid reason",2
"A lot of ads lately, but at least I'm mostly seeing things I enjoy, albeit very few posts from the people I actually follow — I basically only have my notifications to go on, there. I probably don't interact enough to make them show up. Don't know, really, nor do I especially care",2
I have been using Facebook since 2014 and the journey is amazing though I had some issues regarding privacy but now the concern is for editing. I can edit my picture on Facebook before uploading it but why that's not for the profile pic and cover pic?,2
"There are some people that post beautiful words, advice,challenges and comfort that lift others spirts, hopes and dreams and fill them with light. That is what I love to see, hear, feel and witness what we are capable of doing for one another. In a world that can be so harsh and it sometimes feels like we are alone, lost in the dark. I hope we look, listen and learn. We are capable..",2
"nice app, new modified interface and above all, it is really painful that after investing in it, exhausting your data, time, resources and energy I can't monetize it.",2
There is some issue on my facebook account that most of the time it used to whhen i reload Facebook home screen & video watch screen doesn't come new but always the same thing shows me i request u dear Facebook team to solve the Facebook glitch & issue asap thankyou.,2
"everytime i put the video in whole screen then rotate it in landscape mode, there's a buffering sound. i thought it is the phone's speaker problem but i tried it in other apps and it didnt happen",2
This is good. we can remove other social platform. Not Facebook. Facebook is normal site daily routine site. I removed many social platform many times. But not to Facebook. Facebook is general social platform. WhatsApp and Facebook will run till long time. In new trend nowadays is winning Instagram. I removed Instagram many times. But not Facebook. Facebook can use with any thing any site. We can play high level games with attachment to Facebook. Facebook never can die.,2
Good to have such app that provide you updates of your relative life and happenings. Sometimes it serves as a memories storage system wherein all of the memories saved in this app and treasure it and reminiscing with families and friends.,2
"I would give it 5 stars, but since I am only 17 I'm not able to even look at market place. Making getting a vehicle difficult for me and my family. Wish they could set up market place a bit different. Other than that the app is good. It is a place to communicate with others and look at things like communicate posts.",2
I use Facebook from 5-6 years and it's a great journey with it. It's such a great time which i spend on Facebook.but nowadays there was a problem Facebook is not supporting free basic mode i requested to Facebook team please fix this issue.,2
Suddenly when I click on something to open the link it doesn't work. Or it flashes a white page halfway onto the screen only to disappear again. Can't read anything.,2
"Everything at Planned is wonderful except they moved to an inconvenient location, and they never, I mean NEVER answer or return phone calls. If they returned calls, I'd give them a 6-star review if possible. I completely trust the doctors at P.P.I. and recommend them to everyone. They took amazing care of my very sick German Shepherd (who loved going there) and were able to keep the cost down for me, too.",2
"Why is there not an option when reporting apost to say ""unrelated to group"" (ie: if I am following a recipe group and a post is added that is not related to the group, I want an option for this). I don't want to report stuff like this as spam cause sometimes it's not. I also want an option for ""goes against group rules"". These option will better help reporting non offensive/spam posts.",2
"I use and enjoy Facebook, but my experience with their dating app was terrible. Every woman who responded turned out to be a fake profile trying to scam me. When I reported this to Facebook, they did nothing to address the issue. If I did manage to get a response, it was only to say that the account met their standards. It's clear from a simple image scan that these were fake accounts, and it's unacceptable that Facebook is not doing more to ensure the safety of its users. I stopped on Dating",2
"For some reason, I can't find my history of viewed content. If I didn't like or react or comment on it, I can't ever go back and see it when I want to read it forever. It's like the feed is a magical place where if you look away once, when you look again, then post you were reading is forever gone and the page has refreshed again.",2
One problem is I can't see my phone's clock and battery status on the top of my screen. Every app should let the user see the time and battery remaining directly without changing the app screen. I condemn this.,2
"Till now facebook helps me to finding market opportunity. Recently i encountered a issue, I'm not getting group notification which i set prioritize as well not getting login or message notification in my primary email. Solve this issues as soon as.",2
"I love facebook! I have been part of this for a long time now. it has been a great way to stay in contact with my friends and family. sadly over the past couple years it has become riddled with political ads, disinformation, and way too many fake advertisers. I wish that Facebook would police its advertisers the way that it releases its members",2
"There will always be Facebook.. in this world. The new update has a glitch in dating when going through likes,matches, and friendship.. screen goes black and doesn't want to load. An took the option to mark messages as read.",2
"Facebook is constantly ""optimizing"" and messing things up just when they start to work right. also, it should not be so difficult to change the order of photos prior to, or after posting",2
"I only rate it as 4 stars because earlier this day I was pissed off of its notification panel for media uploads! why? because whatever I do it cannot be swiped away!! I just need to turn it off on the settings so I can get away with the irritating NOTIFICATION PANEL!! but it's all good!! nothing more, nothing less",2
I'm liking everything so far with this app. Many of different opportunities to make money. I don't like that you have to pay money to make money. It would be great if it was easier to receive the money. Also take the money out of the earnings if needed. There a lot of changes to read about. I'm still learning about all these changes. I'll update more later.,2
"Using Facebook from 2015., I updated the app today and it's behaving irregular. When watching reels or videos, whenever, I press back button, it shows call settings",2
Facebook is whare you need to Look especially for people Your trying to get in touch with if you haven't talked too or seen them in awhile your just about guaranteed to find them here if you don't find them here be sure to recommend this app to them so you well be able to get intouch with them a lot quicker next time,2
"I absolutely love fb as I get to catch up with ppl. 4 stars because I wish they would update the other backgrounds for posts (it's been years). Sometimes it's difficult to find a comment u are mentioned in if u mentioned someone else. U click the notification and it brings u to the comments in general. Not the one u were mentioned in. If it does and the convo is 200 comments deep, good luck. The algorithm is amazingly awesome and it's entertaining. Could be on for hours. Especially on reels.",2
"As long as you haven't been hacked it was great for a few years. but now, after giving them the correct I.D, they still won't let me back into the hacked account. So yeah, am still abit ticked off about their so called ""security services """,2
It's a great app to stay in contact with family and friends. Also be able to have updates photos and more especially when you don't have any family or friends close to you.,2
"The Facebook app provides a user-friendly interface for staying connected, but occasional performance issues and resource consumption can be frustrating. Regular updates address bugs, but the app's feature complexity might overwhelm some users.",2
"Facebook app is fantastic and convenient! Unfortunately it is missing some of the options available to those on PC version. To get those options, must log in on a web browser.",2
To me Facebook is one of the greatest social media platforms ever created... It's an awesome place to stay in touch with family and friends and promote your business.. Seems like every year they coming up with different features for Facebook to help you interact with your social circle better..,2
I will say that Facebook and FB Messenger have helped me to stay in touch with friends and family that I would not have easily been able to stay in touch with otherwise. Thanks Facebook for keeping me in contact with friends and family since 2009 I believe!,2
It's recommended but the only thing I don't like about Facebook app is that once phone's screen is locked then the post/video/reel is gone and there's no history from where we can get back what we were watching/reading. If once it's fixed you'll surely get 5 stars.,2
Facebook is restricting me continuously without any reason. I didn't do anything offensive. But in every 24hour Facebook is restricting me. I reported my problem. But they didn't fix it yet. I'm so annoyed because of this.,2
the app resets all the time when you pause and there's no forward function if accidentally go back and the app has reset again. you're not likely to ever see that post ever again it doesn't work properly and can bevery frustrating at times,2
"It's a good app. But can u pls eligible this app to move into SD card cuz it takes literally 435mb of my storage from 32gb. I am using many other platforms of yours like instagram, and messenger but it can move to sd card but this app can't. Otherwise the app is like gg!",2
I like all features except the end to end encryption ☹️ as a memory keeper I don't like it .. hope messenger will gonna delete that features later🙏🏻and I recommend messenger will add a photo slide in a story just like TikTok☺️🫶🏻,2
"Great app, I love the dark mode. I always wished to use Facebook in dark mode and now i got it on new update, the thing i decided to give 4 stars is because I can't see my notifications that are older than a week! Please fix that",2
"Probably will be a Facebooker for my days to come. Like the integration of Instagram and other platforms. Only thing I dislike is when the intellectual property and ownership came into play, I lost alot of my posts without a way to re-research or have keywords to go search the posts again. Memories feature is now filled with ???.",2
Suggestion for upgrading ur reels function to editable like normal post do... Great job updated version much more better... Another suggestion whereby u can create folders for users to store & find the classify post more easily...,2
Great.,2

"well it's Facebook, either like it or don't use it! Just be wary of imposters, people posing as someone they're not. That's the only thing I dislike about Facebook, but that falls into the user error category, the error is the user themselves! But when used as intended Facebook is a marvelous platform to keep in touch with family and even rekindle some old friendships! And all the extra security checks, please take the time to do them, they are very helpful for controlling your feed's content!",2
"Just remembering back when FB first hit the screen back in the day. The one that took out MySpace!!! And it was really good then..and if u can remember how it was back then, then you will be blown away to all the features and tools that it has now!!!

"Use Marketlace and private groups, it's great! Have met so many new friends and contacts. Have had my account hacked twice through Messenger app, was a pain. And also got locked out and could not get back in due to the 2-step verification ""keys"" which I had never heard of nor did I set up. I don't remember ever being prompted to set up ""keys"" when I opened my FB account like a ka-jillion years ago...that was an absolute nightmare!",2

"I used to live in a studio apartment just two blocks from the beach. I often would go out at around 3:00 AM totally naked taking nothing with me. I would walk those two blocks, completely naked, down to the beach, where I would spend the night until the sky would begin to lighten.

Facebook is amazing at collecting your personal information for reasons unknown and passing it onto parties unknown. It's a wonderful product in that regard and is trusted to do these tasks and more by many governments around the world.

Other social media data collection apps don't quite have the same smoke and mirrors way of collecting and relaying your life the way Facebook does. I recommend!,2

"My opinion of facebook fluctuates from time to time but to be honest about it, it is the best way to express your feelings about things, keep in touch with friends, make new friends, and learn about people from all over the world.

"giving users full-screen highlights of your brand, products, and services. Better yet, the ads work with most formats, such as images, videos, carousels, and slideshows. Here’s how Facebook Instant Experience works: In a user’s feed, the ads appear as regular photo ads A person clicks on one of the advertisements It opens a mobile landing page that automatically expands to full-screen With instant-loading speeds — 15x faster than the standard mobile web — Facebook Instant Experience works well",2
"This app here,keeps you connected with family and friends no matter how close or far away they are. It is very useful and convenient most of time saving. No longer do we have to wait three days to a week to reach them by mail,we have the opportunity to be there by connecting with them. This is the best thing they could ever have come up with coming from the old school generation. Plus it's easy to use and you can have one on one communication. It has its downside but you don't have to be part of",2
My page was and is 5 Stars when I created all of them. I did so out of creative therapy to help myself and my children with the express hope that I could in some way reach others. Things have changed so much over the years and I needed to come from under many things so that I could become a better parent/mother and sometimes father to my three wonderful children and to teach them some things beyond my upbringing that would in some ways help them throughout life. #PushingPink1221,2
"Very impressed with Matt's workmanship. He is a clear communicator who kept in regular contact with us especially since we are living overseas. He completed a number of jobs for us (Kwila deck with stairs, side stairs, removed kitchen bay window replace with flat window as well as removing bedroom floor 2 ceiling window & replacing with sliding door), all with a high standard. As per the pics, no job is too big or too small for Matt. Definitely recommend him to get the job done...and right.",2
"Individuals no longer have to yearn to keep in touch with their friends and dear ones. A single Facebook account enables users to achieve several functions all at once. Another very important feature of Facebook is the online gaming portal which it offers to its users. There are hundreds of thousands of games on Facebook which one can play at any given time. The interesting aspect is the ability to play these games with friends. There are multiple games like Poker, Diamond Dash, Zuma, Farm",2
"Facebook is my go-to for staying connected with friends, family, and interests worldwide. Its intuitive interface makes sharing memories effortless. I appreciate its commitment to privacy and safety, continually improving features to combat misinformation. While challenges exist, Facebook remains a vital tool for fostering meaningful connections and community engagement.",2
"Thank you so much for the pointers, @Phil Rozek. This page currently has 111 reviews, 23 not recommended, 80 recommended, and (from the old rating system) 7 five-stars and 1 two-stars. When doing the math, assuming that the numerical translation for a not recommended is 1, and 5 for a recommended, the average is 4.14, so the current 4.1 rating appears to checks out.",2
"Facebook is one of the most common social networks in the world right now. Nowadays, users of Facebook can write diaries on their Facebook pages rather than on their blogs; they can chat on Messenger, an attached function that Facebook has, rather than on traditional texting; they can share photos, music and even links from other websites.",2
It's been really nice to keep up with the people I love.only problem is when someone's fa ebook gets hacked or if u forget your password and have to make a new profile..there shld be a way to erase old accounts!because I do not like having multiple accounts ..I would much rather have one account.but since I'm not able to get into the Accounts that were hacked I am stuck with like 10 different fa ebook accounts.,2
"Facebook has been an important part of my life. Through its posts, the videos, stories, reels, I have come closest to Jesus, my one and only treasure in this life and in the next. Facebook goes out of its way to help and assist me when I am having difficulties in the use of my gadgets. They made my ""gadget life"" easier for me, and more fun at that. If I may say, Facebook can do the impossible, of course by the grace of God. Thank you Facebook for bringing Jesus to me 🙏♥️🥰",2

"Facebook is still the number one social media platform, and it doesn’t seem like that’s going to change anytime soon. While this is excellent news for marketers, it also means that more businesses are fighting for space to get noticed by their target audience. One way to get your business more visibility is through Facebook reviews or recommendations. This feature can help your business succeed on the platform by increasing your search rank, building your brand’s credibility, and expanding",2
"If you've just been to a really great — or not so great — business, you probably want to tell someone about it. You could just post about it on social media, but that only goes to your friends. It would probably be more useful to let people who actually want the information know. There are many ways to do that, but one way is to post on a business' Facebook",2
I Facebook some of the time and I put music stories for my friends and family to enjoy. Facebook is alright but their friends suggestions suck I get all kinds of weirdos. I reccomend it just don't get in too deep because they control your algorithm and makes to become dependent on it. Otherwise you can control it yourself. I keep in contact with my friends and family by it most of the time.,2

"The Facebook app offers seamless social networking, with easy browsing, engaging posts, and convenient communication via integrated Messenger. Despite its intuitive interface, privacy concerns persist due to extensive data collection practices. Nonetheless, it remains a popular choice for staying connected with friends and family, though users should exercise caution.",2
"It's a great way to connect with friends and family, not to mention the many features that it has, like messenger, you can video call anyone and everyone anywhere in the world, this is my favorite feature, I do a video group chat with all my siblings everyday even though we all live in different states. The Marketplace is also a very useful feature for selling and buying things, if you're looking to date it has that too. There is more, It literally has everything, love it!!!",2
"I think it's about time Facebook allows an account to have a username just like that of Instagram. Since we all have profile links already, it should be easy to generate a username for a profile. And also, separate individual post from tags from other accounts just like that of Instagram. Because, it makes it difficult see posts from the account holder if being tagged a lot. Unless you view the photos.",2
"The best 4x4 luxury SUV of all time. It's in a different class of it'sown. In terms of driving, it has the lofty height that spurs confidence, the opulence of luxury, surrounds the driver.

"Can you please tell me exactly why I, along with more than half of the Facebook users, cannot avoid the app saying that it is not responding, to which one may respond by choosing close aop, or wait. Unless I want to have most of my responses disappear in the middle of a paragraph or even a single sentence, I am forced to answer the pop up modal with the wait option at least twice. YOU. ARE. FACEBOOK! Such glitches should have been completely eliminated before the app ever reached RC1! So...?",0
"The two times I opened it and tried to click on a story, it would glitch and skip three stories to the 4th one and I can't scroll or click back to see the ones that were mussesy. It literally looks like a glitch with the screen flashing like an old TV from the 89's. The full app is way too heavy. This sucks, please fix this!!! I'm on a Pixel phone, fairly recent model, this shouldn't be happening.",0
"As the app is with the site proper, it's a cluttering mess. They add more features that not a whole lot of folks want but never seem to fix the issues that need to be addressed. I can say more but it's relevant to the site as a whole and not the app. Changing your profile picture to a previous one not only does it, but makes another copy of it instead of just switching. They seem more interested in catching up to Twitter/X instead of caring about their users.",0
I only got this app for marketplace and have joined a couple of groups since. Worked well enough for that up until recently. The search in marketplace suddenly gives zero results. Scrolling through listings works well enough but can no longer use the search function. Clearing cache and reinstalling haven't helped. I don't know why these app developers can't leave well enough alone. Everything doesn't need to be constantly updated. You cause more problems than anything else.,0
"Facebook literally hires the cheapest and least compitent code writers. The regular FB app was terrible to use. This app is impossible. So many bugs with marketplace. Worst is not being able to swipe back to go back. It's the only option on my pixel. The simplest functions are missing or broken just like all of FB. So much money, such poor quality. Lastly, the option to open Google maps is no longer working.",0
"UPDATE: Now it only shows 3-5 posts in my feed and says ""No more posts to fetch"". This app is truly garbage. Meta must be wanting us all to stop using it. The lite version is by far the most frustrating app I have. I need a work profile as well as a personal one. Switching between them on the same app is prone to confusion. It would be much better to allow two of the regular version like we had for years.",0
Very annoying & Ridiculous app. Going worst. When I share a video of 4 minutes of duration in news feed but only 30 second video is uploaded. I am unable to send any video in reply of any post or comment as it's not shown in gallery. Only images in reply can be uploaded. Long text messages can't be sent. Edit option for images appears but doesn't work.,0
"This app should be removed from App stores. After scrolling down for long period of hours the app refreshes itself all of a sudden, making me very mad for losing all my progress, and the worst I've experienced was when I was in the middle of a video the app refreshed interrupting me abruptly, I don't think I'll ever be able to find that video to finish it. P.S.: the same happens in all 4 of my different devices.",0
**Update did not solve the Login problem. And now almost every function is malfunctioning. Completely useless. **UPD Now have to login every single time. FB sending SMS messages to a phone I haven't had in years. Security is absolutely worthless. FB is now a complete waste. Feeds are overwhelmed with garbage Page Suggestions and ads so that you can't find any Posts from Friends or Liked Pages. Pathetic.,0
"Message Requests Dear [Facebook Support Team], I hope this message finds you well.

Telenor is a network provider in pakistan. Whenever we try to upload video or trying to open external link sometimes so the pop up messages appears (Buy a data pack from Telenor) even we contacted with telenor as per them this is an issue in Facebook which is not yet solved from almost many months and there is no any such serious complaints portal on Facebook which solves our issues instantly. In addition we have almost 200GB data in our sims which is valid for 24hours.,0
Think Facebook is a great SM platform I also think it's hard to navigate the last year in terms of the way it glitches so often Returning an article closing out reels in the middle of making one going back to My homepage when I'm trying to backspace an article.closing out of videos untimely. Telling me my sessions have expected and to log in again.Not having an option of inviting everyone who liked a post at once.thank you Prakash bohara video verl and views help.,0
"It doesn't have all the features of regular Facebook. I'm sick of having to get out of my chair in the living room and come all the way to the bedroom to get on the computer to get on Facebook and do what I'm trying to do. And unfortunately, Facebook will not download onto my phone at this point. Facebook states that it keeps stopping... I don't know what they did but I wish they would fix it.",0
"I have updated the app,install reinstalled it,refreshed the page but my video feed is not showing videos.Instead all I see is a black screen with nothing on it but the other features work fine.I can watch to pages I followed to and do everything else on the app but my video feed is blank.Please fix this issue.Would really appreciate it.",0
"There are bugs in this Facebook Lite! How can it be showing blank page while chatting in a message and the policy providers can't dictate a hacked profile that the hacker share/upload a nude video link even to the extent of tagging the hacked account friends. The most unfortunate thing again is, someone can't report such incident!!! Do something about it please!!!",0
"I just spent the worst part of 2 hours - 2 hours I will never get back - going thru my feed and blocking every page and profile I did not follow myself to clear my feed. It never ended! I just gave up! What's the point of a feed, of social media, if I cant find the people I follow?! FB is getting worse and worse by every greedy, counter intuitive, stupid new decision made.",0
It asked me at least 15 times so far to add my high school which I don't even think exist anymore I don't know why trying to get on my privacy so bad when I choose no or hit the X I've been through this at least 15 times on several things reels/videos keep popping up I have no interest in and I've already hit from my profile mutant notifications how open the page nothing but videos I got rid of are there,0
"This is really bad, because can't see any Facebook photos story with this lite app, and sometimes notification don't come any group or page or people photos video's. but same setting same system Facebook app working, so I think fix need lite app.",0
Can you please bring back the old Facebook Lite? This update specially the end-to-end encryption sucks because it starts deleting messages even though I put pin to secure my messages and also turn off the secure message option. I really am a person who is sentimental and I really do like to collect messages and picture for documentation of memories but this update isn't really helpful!,0
"Lite version is fast than the previous one. The only problem I have is when you report a problem , I don't know if you even respond to the problem or how long it takes to respond. My Facebook account was hacked, someone using my account pretending to be me and scamming people. I reported the account but nothing you didn't block it and the account is still visible. I suggest you should give a direct contact or direct standards to reach your help center so it should be worked on fast.",0
"I've been experiencing crazy inconvenience lately. Like the app is not the same as before, there are times that even if I have a cellular data , it doesn't let me log in. And also, I've noticed that there are times that the messages is not showing. It comes to the point where I have to open my chrome to see if my friends replied.",0
"I wish I could give 0, I lost my important account , just because I had turned two' factor authentication to secure my account , and logged out , I had forgotten my account , when I tried to recover there was no option for recovery no OTP no sms no phone number option, it keep saying device not recognised, do not use fb lite i suggest you, most useless ever seen i tried many ways but didn't work , no customer service . Not a problem solving, just a seller .",0
"This app is unfortunately useless, the navigation system actually has issues that i can't follow up with neither understand, that's the number one problem, the number two is how long you have to wait for the messages section to open up for you to continue chatting, for me it takes up to a minute or so which is quite frustrating, the number three problem is how the messages turned out to be, and the features added to it. This new update is totally useless, no one should download this app,trust me",0
The new update is the worse experience i had Such as when i switch to another account it's just like loading for a long time and you need to close the app so that you can use it again... It's really un inconvenient for all of us that use your app and your service. I hope it will get resolve. But it looks like it's gonna be a big downfall for you,0
"This app has become basically useless in the past year. First of all it randomly refreshes in the middle of scrolling your feed,ect. I have over 300 friends but only see like 5 different ones in my feed. Nothing but adds. No matter how many times I change it in my settings. What happened to showing my followers on my profile page?? Just disappeared a few days ago. Marketplace just shows same items over and over. Frustrating.",0
"I am having a problem. Whenever someone sends a video in Facebook Lite message, I play it and the video plays but when I skip a part of the video, the video does not play. This problem is coming in the new update, please fix it!",0
I'm having a very bad experience with this app.it keeps reloading on its own and when I try to open a post or page it slides back to the previous page..it only stops sliding back when I close the app and open again but after a while it continues..I've updated it but it keeps on happening..you guys should do something about it,0
"Everytime I foward or rewind a video, it stops playing . I can't get it to play again unless i scroll down and come back to the video again. Its shocking because this bug has been here since 2022 and nothing has ever been done. It really wastes time and data! Do something Facebook!",0
"I'm currently very frustrated, I think this is the most inconsiderate app I've seen. Worse still the help team seldom replies to distress messages. My account was hacked a few days ago, and since then I've kept appealing to the Facebook team for help, I've provided everything asked of me but yet no positive results. I personally think once your Facebook account is hacked there's no hope of getting it back, and what's worse? The hacker has been milking my friends and using me as a surety.I'm wait",0
"I had been experiencing a very odd situation where whenever I try to open this app something pops out in the screen saying ""Meta App Manager keep stopping"" and I tap somewhere to make it disappear the app suddenly just closes itself, same thing just happen when I ignore it the app just closes itself. and why does it only act like this on my phone?",0
"Scrolling through photographs on a page, the pictures abruptly disappear unless you close the app and launch the application again. The same thing happens while viewing reels on a page. Please repair this; it is really frustrating and a waste of time.",0
"Once upon a time to install Facebook Lite was 1MB with zero problem, now after all the updates and updates and updates it takes 8MB to download this app with lot's of problem, now once you click the app it load for lot's of minutes before showing you News Feed and all, unlike before, also now trying to login account is a problem, you'll get a pop up message ""Unable to login, An unexpected error occurred, Please try logging in again."" this need fixing ASAP",0
"Share to friends timeline has no search. You have to scroll hundreds of people to find the one person you want. When I scroll I get black screen. After Clicking on notifications, the page does not load correctly and Makes you sign in again. turned autoplay video off but videos still play",0
Privacy controls aren't effective enough to stop Facebook users and they're supposed to have a Facebook account and not go through someone else's account to get on Facebook. All videos must be updated every day. Two step verification is not correct either. A person who has an account! But if the phone number changes? Guess what the account is still there wether if the phone number was changed. So this keeps Facebook account regardless of the phone number. A phone number can be privately informed,0
Very poor experience. Application wants my personal ID issued by Government etc. Never seen any app trying to spy and track you like this one. What an hopeless app. I joined this somewhere in late 90s or early 2000s. It seems to have changed hands from Yahoo I think so to some data collectors and sellers. Better keep away from that,0
"Full of misleading gambling & fake dating adverts that Facebook have actually approved - they must like takkng advantage of people, who'd have guessed?! Algorithms are horrendous - it rarely ever shows my friends posts, or my posts to friends, even pages you like will fade out & it just keeps showing you random & irrelevant posts. I wouldn't be on facebook if I didn't have to have a page for my business - but now it doesn't even show the text in my posts with links!",0
"No option to disable the in-app web browser. There's never a situation where I'm like ""I want to open this link but I don't want it in a tab in my default browser, I want it to hijack the app I'm using."" Since there's no way to disable this non-feature system wide in Android it's incumbent on app developers to let me disable it, or ideally to have it off by default.",0
"Constantly fails to work correctly. A huge number of features are missing or don't even actually work, constantly has issues loading things despite having five bars of 5G in an uncongested area or 600 megabit Wi-Fi as the only device. Simply pathetic.",0
"Font size got bigger suddenly. I didn't touch settings, and when I did it doesn't fix it. Also the issue of comments not appearing when viewed despite having the notifications and it always direct me to original post instead of the comments. Now, the images from comment are squeezed, that a 16:9 turned 9:16.",0
I can be viewing my feed page in this app then all of a sudden I get a tap pop up that I never touched. I am glad I am not the only one getting this glitch in the app. Even after an update this app still does this. Please make it stop it makes pages think that I messaged them when I didn't. Also giving hacker's a free run in hacking others accounts should be against your rules no? Edit Lite app is down today claims your working on it. It updated yesterday not need two days updates🙄.,0
"""I have a dislike for it primarily because of the font size. My inclination is towards a more petite and delicate font, yet, alas, when I opt for the small font size, it unexpectedly transforms into a medium-sized one. I am hopeful that you possess the prowess to rectify this predicament.""",0
"If I could leave less than one stars I would. No way to recover an account. No customer service. No way to contact them in anyway. A truly awful platform that is anti human in every way, that is basically on the side of the hackers that steal accounts seeing as there is no possible way to actually get your account back. There is no recourse. There is no way to get into your account if you can't get to the authenticator you used. Terrible. -100 stars.",0
"Where the heck is the ""personal and account information"" option in the settings of my fb lite app? why is the layout different? I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app over and over again, but my version is ever so slightly different from the normal fb lite app that my friends have, like why do i have a different version? is it because of my phone? I'm not using a vpn if that's what's causing it, heck, even my friends own some very new phones but their app is still the same old fb lite!",0
"Inspite of marking several times never autoplay videos the videos plays automatically which is draining my battery and data. Also while checking the settings, then cliking media it also shows that never autoplay videos is active. Very disappointing!",0
"I just kept upgrading it but I can't open it, the app is bugged and not opening, so many ups and downs, it keeps lagging and sometimes takes a whole lot time to open, doesn't run smoothly no matter the internet service provider I use",0
I always see one problem in this lute Facebook and the problem is when i watching videos when ever i farward the video become stop and this way i go up and down or full full screen in video so the video become start again but why i always see this problem and why you are not fix this i allready update the latest version of your fb but there is nothing different and same problem i face again and again .,0
"It takes a long time to load anything I tap on. Usually have to restart the app. If you have no data constraints, just use the regular version. I hope a new competitor comes along and does to Facebook what Facebook did to nexopia.",0
Have been using Facebook lite for a year now but ever since the new update i can no longer send messages it keeps say couldn't sent i have to subscribe again still showing the same thing and after some minute it will just show white screen i mean blacked nothing at all will show again so i have to wipe it off and enter the app again still showing the same thing pls try and fix it,0
"New lite is good there are good features but when i use the app with poor connection, the message are not display instantly even i already refresh it./ In the old version even i have poor connection when i refreshed it, the message are instantly change. Hope this will be change/fix",0
"This app is very bad. Stopping unexpectedly, jumping to different places without my action, it's bad. Work on the bugs. Sometimes the send button is replaced with a sharp for a long time",0
"I don't like this app. When I tried switching acc it always shows up the ""something went wrong"" and then i cannot open the app anymore until now even though i uninstalled it and downloaded it again. Please don't download this app if you won't get frustrated!",0
This app is becoming annoying day by day I have been unable to react to stories for the past one month now App keeps crashing whenever I click my device home botton to check something when I return back to the app it crashes..,0
"The app was sooo good before this stupid update, I mean why why why did u do that? I'm talking about this new torture end to end encryption, it sucks!! I can't receive my friends messages and they can't receive mine and I can't see if my msg is delivered or not. PLS WE NEED THE OLD VERSION BACK!!",0
This app is being worst day by day these new update are worst .. The end to end encryption is just worst ... Every time I open messanger I don't get all the messages... When I remove the account and login again .. I lost all my messages and I also can't see my messages in oth r devices . I think the end to end encryption safe system is worst,0
"I really really wanted to complain about the end-to-end encryption. not only i am losing many convos with my friends. but still the chats are AUTOMATICALLY seen, even though i haven't opened it yet. WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF END-TO-END ENCRYPTION?? we're putting a pin but then most of the importants convos are still missing. IT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE'S INVADING MY PRIVACY ONCE I OPENED THE CHATS AND IT WAS SEEN AUTOMATICALLY.",0
For the last three days I have been installing and uninstalling Facebook lite but it continues to give me problems.Messaging friends has been difficult.They send replies to my texts but I can't see them for about half an hour.It also keeps hanging.It is really frustrating,0
"When open comment or other menu, then back to before menu, Suddenly return to the menu that was previously opened Please fix it. I found the problem, this bugs get when use mobile data Most important On Telkomsel cellular Please fix it and When opening an existing picture message, after going to the message page can not move to the previous page",0
Today I tried opening my Facebook lite but I can't get access so I searched to my information they it might be an unstable network but when I checked my network was stable so I uninstall and reinstall it but it won't open I think they have to do some changes in this app,0
"Basically ang pangit nang update ni Facebook, I always experience that when someone chats you on fb it didn't appear in sa message section, but if you look in the messanger you can see that there is someone chatted you, also even if your typing or scrolling the facebook well just loading as if you've just open the app, what kind of update is this? this app is not going well as before.",0
Seriously I'm tired of all the kind of stuff why my FB after some minutes my FB we be showing me white I won't be able to see anything except i exit it and reopen the FB app again after some minutes again the same thing please you have to resolve this issues... I don't know what exactly you people are still waiting for before you fix this issue,0
Useless. Phone told us to install Facebook lite when we all ready have it. when u install it asks u to log in again. It's mucked up Facebook marketplace. Meta sucks big time. No use for their system. App needed updating!! Overcomplicated control. we dont neef complicated. Just need simple & working.,0
"The messages can't open, it keeps telling me the there's a problem ""parsing"" the messages. Whaever that means... Even after updating it... It got worse! Please fix it!",0
Horrific. I've been suddenly logged out and I'm unable to relog back on the app. No reason or anything. Just an unspecified error of which I've sent you a screenshot. Plus I can't find the main app of Facebook on the Play Store.,0
"Updating this app is another kind of problem I am facing, I just opened my app and the request to update pop up I don't have option than to update since then I wasn't able to open my messages after several trying it says l can continue using my Facebook while they loading my messages over 2days now What a boring",0
"Crashes constantly! Especially Marketplace.... constantly losing listening information before I can post, sometimes taking three or four attempts to post a single listing",0
"Hello facebook, this app is really sucking this days, I have an account I tried creating another profile, now me wanting to add all my friends through the former account it's not showing them up, what's the issue, I think you need to work on that as soon as possible",0
Facebook picture and video quality is very low these days and I hate it I don't know what's wrong with it...it actually happened after I opened infinx cloud account and I thought it was it's fault but it turns out it's coming from the services itself,0
"I like the new update but the navigation system is broken. I don't use the traditional three button navigation for my phone. Instead I use swipe gestures. For me to go back to a previous window, I have to swipe from the edge of the screen which works 100% of the time in every single app on my phone and before I updated Facebook lite. Now it doesn't work anymore and I find myself stuck on a particular window every time It's annoying",0
Just had a Facebook update. But unable to login into either of my accounts (personal or work). Downloaded Facebook-lite and can't log into it either!! Return Facebook to where it was before the latest update!!!,0
It's useless for notifications. Every time I click on one it gives me an error when Lite tries to open. I don't browse FB so notifications are the only thing that matters.,0
Like seriously this is so annoying guys Could you believe since I updated my Facebook lite app since then I can't get through my messages? It keeps saying that I should continue browsing while they prepare my messages what nonsense. Please you guys should try and fix whatever problem it's that the app is having of a recent before I'll come back here to review my post.,0
"Can't add pics to comments or even a post using the lite app. It says it works, in reality it deletes everything I wrote and never even post anything. I lose what I wrote and have to start over on a different device with a full app or a computer 😡",0
"Do something about sudden refresh of the app,its annoying and most times i can't find the video, write up or picture i was engaging before the refreshing, it's really annoying,do something about it",0
Please bring back the old fb lite please without end to end or pascode to enter because it's give more struggle special I'm student some of my documents rn is missing because of end to end or the pascode I'm crying rn because those documents I need for tommorow reporting and I don't have any extra in my file manager bacuase I delete it. Please do your things and work don't give as a another struggle because of this new update system.,0
"This is my first ever review of an Android app. I felt compelled to write it because Facebook lite is BY FAR the worst app I've ever used. It works for very basic scrolling of Facebook, but I can use my browser for that. Facebook market is broken, the app keeps getting stuck while browsing ads and 9 out 10 times I cannot create new ads because I keep getting generic error. Also the editing of ad fields is broken, the text boxes cannot be navigated and text disappears after I have written it.",0
"Well I don't know actually if anyone has noticed this or not but the meta platforms are now a days is a dump of random suggested accounts and ""reels""only,which are just meant to keep you entertained only no productive things are shown or suggested and my review might be deleted or marked as false statement saying the feeds and suggestions are based on the user interactions. Hope some people may agree with this review.",0
"Their marketplace is great, it gives me items 180 miles away even though it says 40. Enter a single word into the search and it gives me unrelated items. Chats don't give notifications even though I have them enabled in every place I could find",0
"I literally only need an app for Messenger, since Facebook's official messenger app is bloated, battery-eating garbage, and FB (I'm never calling them by the stolen name ""meta"") also sabotaged all third-party messenger apps. The push notifications on this app only ever notify me of birthdays. Not messages, not anything else. The literal only reason I keep this app around is for messages, because it still beats full-on Messenger.",0
I am experiencing errors because its been a month that i can't use fb lite for a reason that every time i open the app it will open for a second and will automatically go back to my main phone screen menu..for short it doesn't work ..,0
The email field is not at all focusing to enter email address in my redmi 9 pro. Password field alone focuses. Yesterday 25/02/2024 the app view and today 26/02 the app view looks totally different. Not sure what happening. The UI design looks not loaded properly yesterday.,0
Why does everytime I open Facebook lite my phone keeps on rebooting (it will suddenly turn off itself and then on) don't tell me that there's a bug on your application..?This issue only happens whenever I am inside the Facebook application.,0
"I just don't understand how the facebook lite in my phone refreshed and was told to login again and that's what I have been doing since the five hours I really fail to understand is that my account has been hacked or the app has issues am told ""an unknown error occured"" I havet tried to reset the password and that's just another hell plesase the developer of this app kindly do the necessary i can't afford to loose my account",0
"The font will change itself. I chose smaller fonts, but then this app will insist on making the fonts larger. I prefer smaller fonts so that no one can easily read anything for privacy, but this app is super trashy",0
"On one bad day as usual when I open the Facebook app, I was not able to get in instead it says enter your password, I entered my password, Even I reset my password, then also the app refused to login to my id. Then I felt that only solution I can get with the Facebook help center. I came to the Facebook help center and tried various activities guided by them but still useless because I didn't get back my account. On one page The Facebook asked me to confirm your identity by uploading any of your",0
"I was annoyed because i was not that long term memory to remember some of my account's password and this app some time save the passwords at first and then after while of some days it requires me to enter my password, like there were days i was in a rush to check something or some chats in my second account, and it requires me to input the password, and literally i dont remember my password that time which cause me to feel annoyed of this facebook lite's new feature.",0
"This time I can't log in any of my account even my sister's account can't go through in, I put the right password for my account and it only show up log in error! I tried to uninstall and install the app, still nothing happens!",0
"Often this app i bugging, While I'm watching videos the app eventually goes the log-in section then when I tried to log-in my Account it is accusing Error but my info is all correct. And yeah after 2weeks the never works. So I rate it 1star I prefer FACEBOOK not lite.",0
"It's ever in need of updating it every day, every time . It's always telling me that my messages are not yet ready whenever I try to open with ones conversation. I'm having it's daily issues of installing it every after when my phone goes off",0
the app lacks some crucial features like how to remove or hide the adult videos from Facebook. I tried my best to remove adult videos from Watch videos but it always shows me adult videos. Very very frustrating 😔. Please as soon as possible add an option to filter 18+ videos to make the app family app. 😔♥️,0
"I'm giving this app 1 star because it sucks Like I've been trying to get into it but it keeps on saying something went wrong please try again It has been a week now,I even contacted them through email I got no reply I've cleared caches and even clear my story and uninstalled and installed still not working pls if it has to do with the new update please remove it cus I'm fed up.",0
"Despite being a product of a major corporation, we're experiencing various issues such as continuous refreshing during prolonged scrolling, black screens, and encountering error messages.",0
I've mot not been able to access the app again after updating it. Several attempts to log in proved futile. Am notified there's an error while logging in so I should try later. Please kindly address this issue.,0
works okay. App is pretty buggy and glitchy and the dating function doesn't work accurately. Setting a distance radius still gives you suggestions from waaaay far away.,0
Free data feature has been remove. This is usually what I use whenever I ran out of data cause with data i preferred using the Facebook App. So this app basically do not have any basic options anymore.,0
"For the last few days anytime I try to share anything before I can even choose who or where to share it this pops up and I am confused by its meaning since it pops up before you can choose a page to share. ""we had a problem with the page you tried to reach we hope to ha e it fixed soon you will be directed to the home page.""",0
"This app doesn't let me log in if i log out my account its always say due to unspecific error, i always need to uninstall the app just to log in my main account but after that i can't log in in my other account i have 2 accounts one for my school and professional works and the other is the one im using my personal account I'm force to use my personal account to do other school or professional related activities and i don't like it, please fix this kind of bug",0
What the heck!!! This app doesn't work even it's not open....my internet is great but why it doesn't open... those app need more facilities.... This app can't upload profile picture perfectly also if I shared a story it's gonna be blurry... Why???,0
"What's this problem with your app, can't have a smooth operation after going out of the app to another app without the app Lagging or restarting, it's very frustrating especially on trying to watch videos",0
Delete this end-to-end encryption update I cannot see my important messages with my friends of family... I cannot use my account when I log out and log in again the chat will be automatically deleted... Fix this now this end-to-end encryption this is not helpful.,0
"Hello Facebook Team, I would like to inform you that please don't translate our text in English, Because most of the people of Nepal can't understand this language. So, I request you that please remove the translating setting, And we are also happy with your service except translating setting. Thanks ❤️",0
"Sorry for saying but this update is not good not a bit, because of the videos generate like reels, that's very unacceptable thing ins this appe. So you should make a solution and change this methode of reading videos. thanks",0

"Takes forever to load recently, despite being a lite version. App refreshes on its own, typically when I'm reading something. Maps links in marketplace always read as ""unsupported link"". I have to go between the app and Chrome to get some sort of functionality. No, I'm not installing the full version or messenger, I tried that and it practically took over my phone. Lastly, it seems most of the content on FB and IG is stolen from TT, complete with eniltire fake accounts from creators.",0
"Functionality and UX has gone downhill. Many glitches. When replying, it double-types names. When editing, after saving it won't let you leave the page, instead you must close and reopen the app. Recently started flipping to Home page in the middle of typing or scrolling. And today in the middle of scrolling it logged me out. Wth.",0
"Every cover photo is flattened and impossible to see. If someone comments on a video I posted to my own page, I'm unable to rewatch the video because it's all flattened, just like the cover photos, in the post and impossible to click on play to watch. If I use the regular Facebook app, this doesn't seem to be an issue.",0
"Often Broken. Listen, if you're going to introduce features into the lite version of the app, please make sure they work. Links in messages took YEARS to work correctly. I want to like this app, but too many parts of it don't work. Marketplace? Works fine, assuming I didn't want to change my search area in the slightest. I can't change the search area, or my location while searching for items. At least now most links sent to me via messenger work.. I suppose it's a step in the right direction",0
"Designed to punish Android users, unless you only want to endlessly scroll. When viewing photos, you can't swipe back. If you tap on a photo or post, screen gestures are restricted and prevent you from going back to the feed. It just tries to swipe the photo. Only app that does this, and it does it for pictures, for marketplace posts, for reels copied over from Instagram. . . makes me constantly want to close the app to get to the main feed. There is a back arrow in the upper left, sometimes",0
"Facebook Lite has at least one bug. When I click on one story, sometimes, it keeps opening up all stories in a rapid sequence. There is some loop over stories which, does not show the video. It opens one and just skips to the one right after. Sometimes, when you try to open one story associated with one account, instead of opening it up, it opens the story associated with another account (the one that comes right after on the display) It is not a new bug. You guys had it for a while....",0
"Just tried this after I saw how much space the full size program took up... It seems to kick me back to the start of the home feed every ten minutes... Really annoying. I was in the middle of creating a post on a page and it booted me back twice, and of course it didn't save anything I'd typed. It also happened when I was just scrolling and clicking... Finally found something I really liked and wanted to share but *poof*.. back to the start and I have no idea where to find that post again. Grr!",0
"Very hit and miss. Sometimes it works well,other timed it just stalls, and stalls, and stalls. It is basically a mobile web browser version of Facebook. Uploading photos can be tedious and often freeze and fail to load. And if you sign out of the account. It can take 10-15 minutes for it to load up and bring you back to the sign in screen. It supposedly isn't a resource intensive and battery killing; however from what I've seen, it is just as bad as the regular FB app in terms of battery use.",0
"I love the small footprint. But, when I try to save a new post, 9.7 times out of 10 says ""unsaved."" You can only access photos in gallery; useless. When I view a page it oftentimes/usually will 1) go blank/gray, then bounces back to my feed, or 2) won't load more than a couple posts. It also refreshes a lot, erasing what you're typing (if it's going to be more than a few words, I now type in another app, then paste it into FB Lite), along with bouncing you back to the feed's beginning.",0
"The app is fine in itself, but over the course of multiple versions, I've been getting a ""something went wrong"" error with zero context or apartment cause. Clearing cache doesn't work, restarting doesn't work, and reinstalling only works temporarily. I'm willing to accept the possibility that it's something else installed on my phone, but there does not seem to be a pattern to when this occurs.",0
"The idea of FB Lite is great. Less bloat and a faster interface for those with low end hardware. I use it on a pixel 2 personally. It is a very quirky and at times frustrating experience though. I have two major gripes/bugs with the app currently. The share dialogue does not work if the app is not open. I have to go open the app and come back to what I was doing and try to share again. The second issue is that when I post a link for example, it deletes the caption I added to it entirely and I have to type it again. The main reason I use the app - sharing content with others - is broken. A dark theme should be added to save battery if we are trying to be efficient. I don't mean grey. I mean OLED pure black.",0
"It was great, but now every time I click on a picture so I can read the text on it I'm taken to Messenger to share it. If I go back I find myself back at the top and not at the post I was looking at. So I have to choose between being unable to open photos larger (FB Lite) and having videos play automatically no matter how many times I change the settings to not play videos automatically (FB). Sigh.",0
"This app is barely adequate. It fails constantly, especially when trying to share something form a litany of other apps or sources. It constantly refreshes while in use, losing the post being created or the place the user is scrolling in the feed. Over the past few months, when viewing an all pages the wall will go blank. Sometimes this can be bypassed by scrolling all the back to the top of that page account and refreshing it, them scrolling all the way back down, only to have it happen again.",0
"How does this keep getting worse. It only loads a portion of comments, it still requires additional login for anything outside there main feed, it breaks on certain shape images including a number of ads, it generates phantom ad clicks. It still allows font size changes which I can't find on the main app. Also just feels less heavy. Both of these options are feeling worse.",0
"I love this app, never really had any problem with it until now. I've been using this app for years. I just got a pop up saying I need to Update Your App because I'm using an unsupported version. I've updated it multiple times, and it's still popping up when I open up the app. I've uninstalled it, downloaded it, and opened the app for the same pop up to Update My App. Fix it, please. Two and a half stars, it'd be a 5 if that pop up didn't start popping up.",0
"As slow and unstable as the full app only takes up less space. Doesnt support gif comments either even though you can search and select them. A real time waste when that happens. Frustrating indeed. Launching takes forever sometimes, literally it doesnt happen. I just dismiss and restart the app and sommeitmes it works, others it doesnt. Im going back to the full version before giving up entirely on mobile fb.",0
"When I open the app, it tells me this is an unsupported version, brings me here, where I click on open (bc this is the version I stalled), & then the app opens and tells me this is an unsupported version 🙄 other than that it's meh. I can't see people's memories, can't add photos to a post, can't add captions to a post, etc. It definitely is lite. BUT it doesn't take up much space, and does do the basics (when I can actually open it)",0
"Edited review: stop chucking ads in our faces, Meta. Go back to a better UI. I used to Love this lite version, has all I need from Facebook while saving on data by cutting all the bells and whistles. You won't be able to post or view gifs, load videos, or actively refresh in the lite version, but that's exact) what the lite version has, at around 20% of regular Facebook's size. And since I mostly use internet from my ]phone, this app also helps me cur down on data.",0
"Having issues that won't go away. 1) After I post something, when I click on a notification, it brings me back to the post...even though I have already posted it. 2) When I'm scrolling, FB brings me back to the top and I have to find where I left off. 3) My notifications won't clear even after opening any of the notifications or clicking clear all.",0
"Until recently this app has been great. I liked the simple and clean format. Lately posts are only loading one at a time. Long posts don't load completely. I am having trouble posting pictures. I've deleted and reinstalled several times. It's still not working right. I don't want the regular Facebook app on my cell phone. It's too cluttered. So, I guess I'm done with this platform.",0
"Built-in browser wouldn't stop opening web pages without me tapping anything. Also you can't change the default browser. I wanna use my phone's browser instead because the app's browser has none of the security features I like, but there's no option to change it. Those two things together gave me enough frustration and security worries that I just uninstalled.",0
"Weird limitations. I wish it was explained in better detail what Facebook lite can and cannot do. Instead you just get to play the guessing game of will this work or not every single time. Every single time somebody invites me to join an event, I have to re-log into Facebook just to view the event. It doesn't make any sense. I appreciate having something takes up less battery usage. The app needs spell out It's limitations instead of letting us bumble our way into constant error pages.",0
"Much lighter on bandwidth and doesn't take as long to load, but it doesn't load functions properly. For example it will crop photos to the timeline previews and just not load the rest, even when you tap to open the photo or save it. One of my posts in a group was removed, and had a notification to see the admin feedback, but tapping the notification just takes me to my news feed in a version of Facebook made for old non-smartphones. Honestly Facebook just gets worse by the day",0
What you save in data you lose in functionality. The app gets stuck in loops when you try to go back from a post in a group. It's difficult to write longer posts bc when you try to scroll back up to proofread it jumps back to the beginning instead of letting you scroll all the way through. Also you can't post gifs. Tried it for a week. Hated it.,0
"Marketplace is the main reason I use Facebook. I opted for the Lite version when they removed pricing from the full version browse thumbnails. I can't post an item in many places as before. Why does it randomly crop photos off center? Can't see my sold items. When browsing I would like to see the newest listings first. I would gladly pay for a Marketplace only app, one with more options and no ads. PLEASE GET RID OF ""IS THIS AVAILABLE"" AND OTHER AUTO RESPONSES!",0
"I had several issues while trying to type with the autocorrect and I know its not my phone because it works fine everywhere else. When I try to autocorrect it either leaves the word as is or deletes the whole word. If I'm somewhere else in the sentence besides the end autocorrect will send me to the end of the sentence. For posts in groups it gives the option to ""see more"" but when I click on it I only see the picture on the comments, not the rest of the post. These small issues are cumbersome.",0
"It's a good alternative for the full facebook app. However, I can no longer see a full picture that gets cut by the preview. It just stays cut so I have no idea what the bottom looks like. And now, when uploading a picture it will only show by most recent instead of accessing my gallery and various folders.",0
"No story.. It suppose to emulate the browser version (but the browser has story).. Also recently it start creating a problem after few refreshs on the feed it says:""something went wrong"".. The only way to fix it is to close app, delete all data including account details, then relogin.. But it can happen again and again and again.. Also there is something keeps downloading after installing ""feature for lite"".. Don't appreciate extra unknown downloads",0
"The last few months, on my tablet and my phone and my other half's phone, there have been many problems. When you start to post, it crashes, and it goes back to the open where the stars are and the same 2 stars keep flashing. Or the post hangs and you can't post it. Yesterday I couldn't get into my memories all day (10/17) and he has this deal where it says you can't post that. One was my picture. It was my face, not political. This is stupid!",0
"This app is compromised. I've used this for a while, but Today I was typing and the screen refreshed on its own, and I lost what I was typing, and the fb algorithm hides things it thinks you've already seen. I've also been getting redirected to other sites or apps like Amazon and Temu when there aren't even ads on the screen. This is a safety issue. If ads are triggering this, then an unsavory ad could redirect you to a phishing site. This app is compromised.",0
"Over the past 10 days or so, there developed a problem when commenting on posts. Virtually every time the app quits outright after a couple of lines of text. The only way to post complete comments now is to SelectAll and Copy every few lines, until the comment is complete. This happens most often when typing a secondary character, i.e., press-and-hold a key, like dash or percent. The issue is not present in full FB app. Returning to app does not bring up the same page - just goes to default feed",0
Can't access all groups I HATE the new Facebook look and my light accout doesn't give you you the option to keep it clasic. My OCD has a headache because things just look like a mess. Nothing to separate the sections. I tried to find my favorite groups from my prior accout but they are not available. You can't use GIF from the app. You can't crop or add effects to pics. On the bright side .... it does not seem to stalk you as much as the regular Facebook,0
"Doesn't refresh properly, sometimes for hours. You get a notification saying someone responded to a comment, but you can't see the response, even an hour later after doing the pull down to refresh gesture. It just doesn't update or work properly. The full FB app kills performance and battery life on your phone, though, so this is at least somewhat usable...",0
"Slow, laggy and undependable. I originally installed this if the full version FB knowing I would be able to do all you can do in the FB app. Notification system is severely broke. i get double notifications. Even after i select a notification 1/2 the time i get ""something went wrong"" pop up. Then the notification is still there. If I luckup and. get to read the reply 60% the screeb is dark blue with black writing and is almost impossible to read. Time to start using FB in Chrome.",0
"It's okay. It look like the web browser version of Facebook, but it's honestly lacking in features. As far as I can tell you can't post gifs, kinda feels like a port job of the iPhone app with all the options on the bottom. I have swipe controls down there, I'd much prefer the buttons on the top.",0
"Something broke that won't load new comments from notifications. They're listed in the notifications but when you click a notification it leads to the comment thread with nothing there. Uninstalled, cleared cache, reinstalled, still not working. Unusable now. Also getting strange random clicks/finger presses that lead to ads I never pressed... am I crazy??? How did it get this bad?",0
"Doesn't fully function correctly. Trying to add a gif comment and the app keeps trying to post my gif as a new post instead. I try making a post with one of the standard background options and this app posts it with a totally different background. Bottom line, this app doesnt let YOU have control over YOUR facebook posts. It also keeps automatically adding peoples posts you comment on or like to ""close friends"" so you get notified every time they fart or blink. Hope the fix it soon.",0
I have reached out to you in many ways to remove this Facebook lite. I use the regular Facebook app for some reason this lite app keeps getting installed. I have turned off auto update to ask Everytime and still it keeps getting installed. I have searched for a way to delete it altogether and it just has the option to update it open. Can you please tell me how to get rid of this app period? Thank you. It is a convenient app if you are trying to save space. I don't dislike it completely.,0
"Kinda works. I just uninstalled it, though. Good luck if you want to upload photos or videos... you know, the original point. Also gifs don't really work here. I think Meta is making the Lite and mobile web experiences deliberately bad so that we are forced to use the resource hog of the full app. No thanks, I'll just use your service less. It keeps getting worse, anyway.",0
I used to like and use the Lite app until they started suggesting marketplace items to me on the menu page. I don't want to see items after I leave the marketplace which is why I turned off notifications for marketplace items. Putting them in the menu defeats my turning off notifications. So I uninstalled and use the web interface intermittently.,0
"I don't like the ""Basic mode plus"" thingy when I run out of data cause the fb lite won't open if I have no data and I can't use it. And the ""Basic mode plus"" has 20 mb so it's not a good thing for me. I hope you remove that in the app but overall, it's nice and accessable for those who don't have a wifi or data. And also put the old version like you can switch the mode if you run out of data. Thanks!",0
"Is it just me, or do we all experience an abnormality in Facebook Lite? One time, while viewing a story, I was shocked because it automatically slid to the next story, picture, or whatever. Later on, I figured out that it will automatically slide when the story being viewed is a picture, but if it's a video, Lite will finish the video before moving to the next then it will repeat again. It's a totally bad experience because I can't enjoy others' stories",0
"Since updating yesterday to v. 398.13.0.0.113, it's been repeatedly crashing at random - not fully crashing with the usual toast, just minimised without warning, randomly - then when I switch back to the app it's wiped the draft whatever I was halfway through typing. I have a love/hate relationship with Facebook anyway, given that it's Meta... but I stay because of the supportive and, yes, in some cases life-enhancing groups. Which cannot function when the buggy app steals our words like this.",0
Bad experience. Even if you block a page it will still display it in your news feed. You want to see less of the type of suggested page yet it shows more of it when you use show less of this suggestion. You block a page it will temporarily stop showing. After 2 days itvwill appear again in your news feed. It os just annoying that they are not considering their user's preferences.,0
"This app is amazing and using it is So nice ,easy and simple . But there have been a slight issue I've gotten ,when I'm trying to open it ,the app doesn't open and a notification just pop up saying that ""network connection not stable"" whiles the network it working well . Thank you and hoping for you to fix this mess .",0
"Better and worse app. Not an social media app, only DM app + comments. Way too many hidden actual functioning pages or options, all to promote ads/spam, friends content is more hidden or harder to reach. Other services give/want extra information after accepting agreements which is evil. Still better reduced waste than the original watered down experience compared to the giant 15y ago. Also gathering data still after you closed the app. Might be the whole system's fault on data than the app.",0
"""I've been a long-time user of Facebook, but I'm increasingly concerned about the privacy intrusion and targeted advertising practices I've observed. Recently, I've noticed that after searching for something on Google, I start seeing related ads on Facebook shortly afterward. This leads me to believe that Facebook is accessing my search history from other platforms without my explicit consent. This practice feels invasive.",0
"It was good before update, right now it's showing unnecessary pages and group on news feed. Also another major problem videos are not playing on story until you click play button. Perviously it wasn't the case ,as of right now it's irritating while playing or watching videos. Sometimes it's buffers a lot .😒😔 So only one two from me .",0
"When I want to log and use Facebook at the crome , massanger option is not available own can not use it and send massage through the crome. Despite of this problem Facebook have some problem also When I log my account in lite if some one send me massage can't gives me notification on the massanger box / inbox . If mine friend send me message I I'm not able to see it it looks already seen . So I request the data base engineers to manage the problem",0
"This app is very good and I am suffering from a problem like when uploading a video to facebook lite the video ratio changes after the video is published, I request you to solve this problem. Because we have multiple accounts, videos are uploaded through the app, so it is not possible to log out of the account repeatedly Thanks to those who are working hard to bring new updates to Facebook",0
"This app is great but the is a big issue that's bugging me, these new update of ads is bugging me out while I am using the app an ad would randomly appear out of nowhere then I press it with it mistake I try to stop but it downloads I cannot stop the download which is really annoying Showing ads I can understand that but forcing us to download it that's a big 1 star",0
"The app was good when it hasn’t any kind of update.. And now It's not working good like it was before.. I can't log into another account, i can't turn on two factor, i log out and its asking for password, i give the right pasword and it Doesn't take the password, I try to set new password and it says that my new password is incorrect.. Wth..! The videos got stuck if I jump to 10 sec 50sec and so much more problems it has.",0
I've used Facebook lite for quite a while and I've loved it. But of late when it comes to watching videos the experience is really bad. Whenever I forward a video it just stops and takes forever to reload. I'm very disappointed,0
"""You know what? I really enjoy using this app, but there is one issue that needs to be fixed. Initially, when I went to the reels, the 'For You Page' was great. However, later on, the content of my 'For You Page' in the reels suddenly changed. It became filled with content from the 'Jejemon' era, something I don't appreciate. No matter how many times I report it, it's still there on my reels. I absolutely detest the 'Jejemon' era!""",0
"This app has been my go-to app for laughs (memes), but now, I can't view pictures nor videos anymore. And I have a lot of data, and my signal strength is great, but for some reason, they wouldn't load. I've updated, deleted and reinstalled the app, but it's still the same issue. Kindly see to this issue.",0
"I totally agree with the rest of the reviews, Facebook Lite always refreshes the homepage whenever it wants and I also have another complaint: there is no landscape mode, which frustrates me a lot since I use a tablet and it is difficult for me to maneuver everything without the correct interface",0
"The new updates is cool but I can no longer send a text on Facebook,I don't know why all this is happening after I finish updating the Facebook,I can't even add friends on,this is getting out of hand, please you guys should fix this, mostly the texting on Facebook,I have been using Facebook for 9 years now and all this is happening 😾",0
"Very pleased with the Lite version until recently, where it doesn't or takes ages to open and you need to delete cache from the App before it opens properly. Need to do this every time..... It's all over my phones,so obviously a problem with the App....",0
"The Facebook lite app has been good until the recent update I made. I can't comment to post because the keyboard refuses to come up. Even after refreshing so many times, it doesn't still come up. This is very annoying and frustrating. Please fix problem.",0
Flawed. Clicking on a notification doesn't take you to the relevant comment. Refreshes happen unexpectedly and take you away from whatever you were reading. Very frustrating to use.,0
"App keeps crashing even after clearing cache. Not sure of the problem, but it is super annoying. May just have to leave Facebook for a while again. At least until this problem is resolved w/Lite.",0
"I'm a paying customer, but the experience is rubbish. I want the lite client as I just occasionally want to keep in touch with people in my network and to follow pages of interest. I've just noticed that, according to this client, some pages no longer have any comments in their threads and that threads with comments have fewer comments and in general less notifications - compared to when I use my computer and a browser. By purpose or utter incompetence?",0
"I can't open my account on this app, even though I can open it on messenger and Facebook. Even my username and password are correct, it showed ""Something went wrong"" and my wifi connection is stable. Please fix this",0
"I'm so disappointed with the app's automatic updating of interface (font size and display size), and no matter how I change the font size in app's settings, it doesn't change at aaaaalll It's so disturbing I don't want to use it anymore ugh",0
"If you're watching a video and there is a network glitch, it reloads and you can't find the video anymore. It does the same when typing, if the network glitches it reloads and all your typing disappears and you have to start again. Putting your phone on stand by or if you receive a call, the app reloads afterwards and you won't be able to find the post you were reading, video you were watching or whatever you were typing. It's boring that way. It should offer to continue from where you left.",0
"Good for watching endless reels, vidoes, market place (as buyer with some caution), and FB messenger. Can't open links on browser, privacy and security very complicated to achieve. Not useful overall.",0
"The total lack of being able to do anything but play tick-a-box for reporting means facebook cant have the issues explained. E.g. I reported the constant stream of filth I am sent everyday and facebook claimed the posts were acceptable, yet when I reposted a screenshot of that same filth I was sanctioned, it makes no sense and you cant contact facebook to discuss, very dissapointing. Now restricted from commenting on posts for 6 days for reasons unknown ??? And constant resets and crashes arhhgg",0
"Well before this app was Amazing and a simplier and easy app to use than regular FB but since end to end encryption happened this was the worst app ever I encountered so far, I can't ecen message my Friends because of the stupid end to end encryption thing... Now what am I supposed gonna do? I guess I would use Discord because that's better than this stupid end to end encryption stuff...",0
It always crash when fb lite becomes meta it has many restriction even if it's slightest mistake and now the upcoming update where only 90 days before the convo dis appears is alarming why? Because my pic and memories of my family and friend will be gone can u please don't do it. Fb lite meta help us users to has a more spacious in our phone storage it help us a lot even though sometimes it crash ot bugs but making convo disappears is BIG NO🙂🥺,0
"I don't know what is wrong with the app lately, perhaps it's an update it needs. I've been using the FB lite for up to 6 months now with no problems so far, but today was an exception. I entered the app only for it to keep on loading continuously for over 5 minutes. Had to uninstall and reinstall twice. I was lucky enough to later enter the app once, but when I tried to check my messages, I wasn't able to. What's going on?",0
"I rated this 2 stars because everytime I open Facebook lite it loads so long that I need to restart my phone and uninstall Facebook lite and aftar that it doesn't work again, I keep trying the method that I was doing but it still doesn't work. And one thing, everytime I watch reels some of the videos doesn't play the screen is just black. And I hope you fix this problem because I need this app and for other people too.",0
"Well I have been on Facebook for almost one year and it was going well until I update it to new version ,though it need it's update but this new was very annoying all I can do is view notification,friend suggestion but my message is not going through even when am having data .please can you fix that",0
"The app is OK The only problem is that I cannot open or view My messages. Every time I try to open it, I receive a notification telling me that my messages are loading of which they are never done doing",0
Takes forever to login though the internet connection is excellent and the app is updated. Cleared data and cache. Still having trouble logging in or switching accounts.,0
"This is a meta app for hackers. They get into your accounts through Facebook a lot of the time. And meta tells me that it's a phishing app! I'm a hacked victim and it's been almost 4 months. I'm still hacked, because any Google I've talked to treehouses to believe that hackers clone these apps to do their hacking. I'm so tied up in Google now. Not only did that hack my email, they went on to make a profile with my account on the Google homes, Google discover, Google maps, Google photos, etc.",0
"My app suddenly stopped working, saying my account doesn't exist💔 I tried deleting and re-downloading it, but it still doesn't work. It is annoying cause even if you say send code it does not come through😪",0
I am having problems with the front size of the current update version. I can't use Small front size. I was comfortable in Small front size. So I wanted that small front size. I hope the next version will solve my problem. Then I will give Facebook lite 5 stars.,0
"There is a bug on fb lite. I'm not able to open videos, whenever I tried it's just back to home screen. Please fix the bug as soon as possible",0
"Facebook Lite has been topnotch until today after I updated it. None of the videos has been playing, once I click play, the app app would automatically close. What's going?",0
"I use the lite version bcs. the Facebook app (and Messenger) consume a hilarious amount of storage. The lite version does not, but instead it has a hilarious amount of bugs!",0
"It's good. However, i still want the old one that you can manually turn to basic mode or data mode",0
"Y is it that you remove Personal Information from it , I want to change my page name and I can't seem to change it and I went to Facebook too there's no personal information there its like you guys remove it from it. Pls fix this and return the Personal Information there.",0
"Comment section for sports especially football have been irrelevant nowadays, many people comments something out of context to get likes, replies or other reactions. It would be good if you could sensor the replies and make them more irrelevant, I can't read two comments about the post. It makes Facebook boring, tbh",0
From the update of fb lite it become to slow and randomly crash but from today fb lite hasn't been opening also i tried many times but it hasn't opening i i request to fb lite owner to fix the problem,0
Facebook as a whole is so ad-ridden that I'm rapidly losing any desire to use Facebook at all. But I do prefer this over the main app.,0
I have been unable to access my Facebook account as it kept sending try again messages. Is it possible my account has been hacked and I could not have control over it again. Please help me out. Thanks,0
"Slow performance, Special when i want to message on new fb id and if someone mention me on comment i notify but cant see his comment, last few update fb lite make so slow, need to mke it fast, and also logout, login bug",0
So disgusting um fb lite isn't working properly i can't even see my new messages i will need to go on messenger just to see the new messenges even if I'm trying to refresh it new messenges won't pop up hope you can fix it soon,0
The safe storage setting is annoying my friends complain because i can't recieve the chat that they sent me and the other reply that i sent are disappearing when i log in again.,0
Updating everyday and everytime is so ectic and data consuming. After updating no new features come in. For sure am tired,0
"this app is good but I can't see who view my stories like something's wrong, and I try to open my another account but it say ""incorrect password"" even though my password is correct idk how to explain it but please work on it I don't want to delete this app",0
The app is good but need to fix some bug like I don't know how to make video call or voice call even if someone calls me I will tap and instead of calling back in only show delete.And again when someone is already offline it says active now if thor their offline,0
I don't receive notifications about new messages. They are turned on in app's settings and phone's settings.,0
Facebook lite stop working at this moment and I try every possible means to connect still not connecting at. You guys should do something.,0
"Horrible It keeps shutting down, blacking out or taking you back Forcefully The app isn't what it used to be and this should be rectified with immediate alacrity else Lite will lose more customers",0
"horrible experiences because it's an extremely cheap platform that is too easy to hack into, making it extremely dangerous for all Facebook members who have been with Facebook for 10+yrs",0
This lite is good but when you are posting the post has many words you reach to the maximum. I.e you post short compared to Facebook,0
You need to improve your tool to send images. It should have a way to select the exact image you want to send.. There's also the bugs...,0
It gets me on free mode even though I have data. It's always up to date but still going crazy. Reels show over videos when I'm watching and I've turned on outplay but they don't play automatically not to mention how I don't get to see the pages of videos I've subscribed to unless I search them again.,0
"slower timeline not change. I keep seeing old posts, trying to find pages for events has become more complicated. And worst of all now, when I close out of all my apps, this one stays up. Until I specifically close it by itself. I have the same phone and have never had this issue before. Update please.",0

"I have Lite because the original used a lot of data in the background, which was messing with my conmection. Notifications rarely work for me; it doesn't let me share (repost) statuses unless I go to their profile and find it; and the app refreshes randomly for no reason (I recommend using a separate app for long statuses/comments so you don't lose what you wrote). Messenger does works in here without needing a separate app, which is great news after the discontinuation of Messenger Lite.",1
"Refreshes out of no where. Can't utilize the rewind or fast forward on most videos. When tried, it opens to full screen instead and then your still unable to rewind or fast forward. Lastly, when I choose the option to no longer see certain videos from specific pages, they still show up in my news feed. I look to check and sure enough, it's already blocked and says I will no longer see these videos. Please update these. My only issues.",1
"It works fine for me. It takes up a lot less space on your device. You can't use a template to post, only white background, editing your posts aren't always allowed and when you get a notification an see click on it, it only takes you to your page, not the notification page or the notification itself. Otherwise it's similar to original version of FB.",1
"Lite does not appear to have the option to place a friend on the Restricted list. This is a crucial element of Facebook & should not be ignored. Also, the event page options are ridiculously restricted. There should at least be an option to copy the text of the address even if it doesn't automatically open GPS. There are many benefits to this app & I'm trying to see the difficulties as reminders to reduce screen time, but it may not work out if there are so many functions that are just not possible.",1
"This app would be great if I could upload photos. As it is, when you try to upload a photo, the blue progress bar goes across the top of the screen but nothing ever happens. I thought maybe it was my WiFi but I tried it somewhere else with the same results. Hopefully this is resolved by a future update because I really enjoy the small footprint of this app.",1
"Updates frequently make me lose the ability to connect trough Wi-Fi and I can only use the app when I'm on mobile data. And this prevents me from watching videos on my feed. Updates should lead to overall improvements, not setbacks! However, I appreciate the small size of this app as the regular FB version no longer fits my phone's dwindling memory. Update (Jan 2020): Wi-Fi connectivity has been restored. Until when?",1
"I don't know if it's the app or my Google phone I'm going to uninstall Facebook lite because it switches back and forth between regular and light, and including my messenger, it's like they've all been synced together. Which totally defeats the purpose of having two different facebooks. For two different things. I'm not spending any more time trying to figure it out.",1
"crashes every time I try to like sometjing. mostly can't respond to events and when I do, it usually marks in ways I don't intend. also, when trying to aces from a phone notification the loading bar just hangs at approx 95% and I have to close out, open directly, fo to the notifications within the app and try again. I love that it chews through fat less battery life,but frustration is starting to outweigh the benefits",1
"I installed this app. It worked fine the first day. The second day, most images/photos weren't appearing. I just saw blank white spaces where they should be even after refreshing. I was able to see the images when I opened a browser app and used the Facebook mobile web page. So, I uninstalled FB lite. I will use the mobile website. That has worked well for me. There is no advantage to installing another app - especially when it fails.",1
"I like the simpler, lighter UI and the fact that it's still reasonably full-featured. I also like the fact that it has dark mode before even the full version. But there is a major bug that makes keyboard presses not register when typing. I've experienced this twice and had the app for less than 24 hours on an S20 FE. No other apps are exhibiting this behavior and a force-close of the app didn't fix it. Guess it's back to the main app or a third-party solution.",1
This app is OK. Its glitchy most of the time whether it doesn't load any comments when you click on comment sections or the share button isn't always lit up when you want to share something. Sometimes the news feed doesn't load at all. Pictures won't load or take a century. Most of the time I'm on wifi so it isn't due to low connection speed.,1
"Small footprint is good.But won't let me comment,share,or react to my page's posts as ME instead of as the page.And when composing a post or comment,if I go up to edit something I already wrote,it won't leave the cursor there. It frequently jumps the cursor back down to the end of the text.Takes forever to write anything that way! Other apps don't do that,so not just my phone. Also, ""Page"" messages don't show for several minutes,even after the notification comes thru & even after refreshing!",1
"I wanted to like this app more than the normal Facebook because it is faster for most things. However, clicking on a notification from within the app doesn't work for me. The bar at the top of the screen loads, but it doesn't refresh the page with the new content. This does work in the normal Facebook app and it also works through a web browser. Also, I'd like for the developers to create a dark mode for the web/mobile/mobile lite versions of Facebook and Messenger! I have a Google Pixel 2.",1
"There's something going on with this app as of 11/3/22. It kicks me out as soon as I log in. I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times. I get an error msg saying ""app has a bug. Developer needs to fix issue"". I used to have the regular Facebook app but I started having log in issues with that. Kept getting a msg box saying log in timed out. Try again so I just gave up on that one. Now Lite is having an issue as well or is it just on my end. Can somebody help me out? Thanks.",1
"I have been using this app for over three years now. It seems to work faster on my phone and takes up a lot less space than the original Facebook app. My one complaint is that when searching Facebook marketplace, this version usually tells me that there are no items matching my search locally. This is obviously not the case as even simple terms return this message. And I end up then switching to the original Facebook app, which defeats the purpose of using this version. What causes this??",1
"Was going to do five stars, but dropping it to three because I can't post pictures anymore. My gallery will not pop up. It's not my phone either because I have tried on multiple different devices and the same thing happens. Wifi is not the issue, mobile data is not the issue, carrier is not the issue. This is on the app itself. My gallery works fine on everything else but this. Even the main app works fine but I don't wanna have to constantly switch accounts which is more of a hassle for me.",1
"It excels over the standard Facebook app in several things such as overall speed and not automatically flying back to the top of your news fees everytime you back out of a post but stinks at other things such as cutting the bottom off of every image post even when you click into the image post. The standard Facebook app will show a shortened image in your news feed but give you the full size entire image when you click into the post. Also, embedded videos are very slow to load.",1
"Mobile website still better but it's improving. For us that can't stand the regular app this is a good alternative, however it lacks certain features, and it sports a slightly less appealing ui than the mobile website, pretty much making it obsolete. On the other hand there's constant updates and improvements, and hopefully one day it will be an actual replacement to the full app/website.",1
"FB Lite has come a long way since its debut; after all these years, it's nice to see dark mode and being able to react like regular FB app, if only Messenger Lite could get a dark mode and the same features as the orig Msgr that would be great, too. It has fallen back on accessibility and has a lot of glitches than it has ever had though, in the past year, so I only gave it 3 stars.",1
"2nd update: Back to closing out videos half way through. VERY FRUSTRATING and now 3 star rating update: the below complaint seems to have been mostly fixed. changing to 4 stars. I enjoyed this app until now. Now it will leave videos to go to newsfeed. It minimizes randomly, it refreshes video feed in the middle of watching a video. It refreshes the feeds and then I lose my article or video. Boo",1
"Having issues while loading a story even when clicking into setting. It's tarts to load but does not finishes loading. It just dims my brightness and it remains in the same page. Not cool, is it possible that you guys get this problem solved like soon please. It would be very helpful. I do believe it started happening after the upgrade, it's really frustrating y'all.✌️",1
"Im neutral. I knew it wouldnt work as smoothly as the regular app but the recent upgrade this week caused Links posted on my feed to not open. If you touch the link, a blank white page opens and nothing happens. Tried force closing, but still not working. Also on-going issue, when posting a link (not sharing) it doesnt show a preview. I have had to share on FB mobile website to make sure the link preview shows up so it doesnt look sketchy. Hope tgey can fix these glitches. I am LG Velvet",1
Quite a bit different both than the full app both visually and functionally. It took me several days to get used to how different the app works but now after a couple weeks of using it I've found that there is no way to post a photo comment. for this i log into FB on the Chrome browser and post it that way. This app will upload the photo but doesn't provide a button to actually complete and post the comment.,1
"I have been using Lite for several years now, and I've preferred using it ever since the standard Facebook app became crowded with features & ads. While there are typically very few glitches with this app, I've noticed ever since the last update (03/19/3023) that I am unable to seamlessly watch one of my favorite gaming streamer's ""run-back"" videos without the video pausing & thinking every couple minutes. I can deal with that but it just keeps thinking and does not keep going. Please fix.",1
"While it does allow me to browse Facebook from my phone while the full app continues to crash every time I open it, this stripped down version isn't without its problems. Recently, I haven't been able to access my Facebook memories. Each time I try to look, I keep getting an error message saying that the app ""couldn't access the page"".",1
"This app is (arguably) what the 'normal' Facebook app should be. Sames goes with Messenger Lite. I was disappointed to find out, however, that the app does not support security keys properly. After enrolling a couple YubiKeys recently, I was unable to sign in to my account on this app. The app displayed a screen telling me I'd get a code by SMS. This was thankfully not true since I had intentionally disabled SMS as a backup. Edit: Still can't sign in with a security key!",1
"A little slow, but it works. Until it forcibly logged me out, crashed, only said 'something' went wrong (Update? Plug-in? I dont know, its just 'something', helpful And intuitive), and gave me a 3hr long loading screen, after which it crashed again. Work on your updates and double check that you remove all of the related code when you replace or delete something and reduce whatever dependencies and permissions youve scattered to the digital winds.",1
Uses less data however it's very glitchy. I rarely get notifications anymore from the 1 page I've been following for 6 years as well as I don't get many notifications from the friends I follow. I switched to lite cause the regular app wasn't giving me any push notifications all of a sudden. This one isn't much better. If I get a notification from 1 page I follow its a post from days ago.,1
"The works good on slow network , and helps saving data . But it has a serious bug . 1st star : if u scrolled too much in a page , the page crashes and gives u a blank. 2nd star : the app refreshs after 5 min , even uf u r reading something , commenting or just scrolling down. Can be frustrating sometimes , especially when righting comments . Other than that the app works fine .",1
"I like the smaller footprint. I've always thought this should be the only Facebook app. But, it's terribly buggy. Photo posts often either don't work or lose photos or lose text. Adding an ""all caught up"" prompt like in Instagram would be nice since no one makes apps with posts in chronological order anymore.",1
"the app is OK overall but still sucks up a lot of battery, even with regular forced stops. also, ever since i started using fb lite, every time i share a photo (1 or more) *WITHOUT FAIL*, my accompanying text -never- appears. i always forget this & then have to edit my post to re-include it — but now, i have to edit photo posts multiple times for my text &/or tags to save. this ends up burying my posts, to boot. please fix this; it is very, very frustrating.",1
Loved it until this most recent update. It seems to have broken it... I only get a white loading/logging in screen that never loads or logs me in. It was wonderful up until this point though and I would have given it a full 5 🌟 and would again if it returns to it's originally fully functional state - it was simple bare bones Facebook for those of us without tons of free space to download stuff who just wanted to check our timeline and mindlessly scroll to kill time once in a while.,1
"Facebook Lite have good features that Facebook don't have. The same thing goes with the original Facebook app. But I like Facebook Lite better. But recently, whenever I comment pictures, it just loads but it doesn't appear in the comments. So I still have to go to Facebook to just comment that pic. Which is annoying because it's time consuming. Also whenever I'm scrolling and reading the comments in reels, the comments disappear after scrolling a little bit. Please fix this",1
"Its a good alternative to the main facebook app but i keep running into little issues. The latest one is i go into an article to read & when i come out of it, it will do 1 of 2 things either it won't let me comment my keypad won't come up or it will refresh the whole page so its back at the top. The last issue you fixed which was the polls option now allows to click show more",1
"Well, I mean it's not all that bad...like the interface Is good, it's quick easy to use amazing app. I love it, but I just hate how when you log in, it'll refresh and log you out, so you basically have to log in twice for once and it's really annoying. And there's a huge white bar at the bottom of the screen and its really unprofessional. Dude this app has been there for as long as I can remember and I dont think we should be talking about these glitches. Wow 😒😒 Otherwise, it's alright 👍🏼",1
"Facebook should stop reloading. Seriously this is getting me mad. How can I be doing something and boom, the app reloads meaning I have to loose all. The app is easy to use and if one wants to reload, they should simply tap the home button. This has been happening but it's not funny any longer. I'll be doing something on the app and it reloads making me loose all that I was doing which is seriously terrible. I hope you guys give this a thought 🤔🤔",1
Good app. One of the best of all social medias but why am giving three stars; this version has contain some connection problem which allow the app to auto restart even on my 4G sim.. This is bad and work on the upload; am talking about the video and photos please!,1
"Facebook is good. It saves a lot of space on the phone. I use it for taking recipes and friend's status. Things start to take a bizarre turn while sending friend requests to strangers especially women. In most cases, the women in fb don't pose as the women they really are. Moreover, these women are mostly selling their businesses. In this way, it's hard to figure out the people who are genuinely looking for friendships and relationships.",1
"It has a really annoying bug. When I'm going to comment on something the normal thing is that the keyboard appears and then I write, right? Well, everytime I try to comment, the keyboard appears but when I type just one letter the keyboard disappears and I have to click the comment box several times because that keeps happening.",1
"I found that Facebook has changed many times to keep up. I don't know how to use it to it's full potential, even when trying something else out I loose my thread and can't seem to go back to what I wanted to achieve. I must admit I've given up trying to master this app. I always end up not really that bothered about it",1
"So many bugs in this app! Especially messages. You can block pages, but their messages still come through. I often cannot accept message requests no matter how many times I tap on 'accept', but tap once on 'delete' and it's gone! The 'shake to report' feature doesn't work on lower end phones. I constantly have to open FB in a browser when features just don't work on Lite. Frustrating!",1
"Some days it’s working badly.. When I select any photo for upload, they can select what picture show at first.. It’s very bad experience.. At the time, we shared any picture in inbox without mb.. Recently it’s not working.. Even, some days ago, I can audio call my friend.. It’s not working..",1
"The app works well overall. I like that there is dark mode and emojis and basically everything you need that Messenger has. The only issue I face is that I don't receive any push notifications. I have added all the necessary permissions both on my phone and inside the app, but they still don't work.",1
"This app is good at data saving and takes less storage space but one problem I'm facing is terrible imat night the dark mode doesn't work good it also puts the share and other options in dark colour as well which is much problematic to use also the options a above including home, notifications etc all goes black with the background ground fix this as soon as possible.",1
"Lots of problems like type one letter and keyboard disappears so you have to bring it back up. And the new problem when posting a photo it acts like it still down loading but if you hit the back bottom its already down loaded to your post. You'll be reading something and the news feed rolls back to the top. If you post a comment after you've posted it, it'll stay in the comment box and post it again. Can block anonymous post. Keeps saying something went wrong try again later..",1
"well Facebook lite mainly it's a fantastic app, it been 4 years now using Facebook lite and not a problem but lately this recent update slightly changed a bit I wasn't able to see all my messages quickly it literally takes time to load all messages which is slow also.. please do something about this perhaps an update would do",1
"When replying to comments on posts; Once I touch the send icon, the name of the person becomes the address code, then changes back to the persons name, plus a duplicate of their name. It appears in blue, then repeated in black. This means I have to edit every single comment, to delete the duplicate (of the persons name. For example: Replying to William Smith, will post my comment as: William Smith William Smith . . . . . Also, unable to highlight the two words I need to delete, so am having",1
It's ok but no matter what i do can not receive messages notifications . I have turned absolutely everything on todo with notifications but absolutely nothing even through my phone everything is turned on but not seeing any notifications . Using pixel 7 . Normal fb just kills my battery life,1
"I only access Facebook on my phone, and mostly successfully. However...my one biggest gripe with it is the lack of screen space given to make posts. I'm not aware that I have any control over this, but the frustration of being restricted to two lines only, when the is plenty of blank screen space below the window, is very annoying. This makes writing very difficult indeed. Please do something to help!",1
It's very good app but the only problem is that we need to update it everyday . Just fix the problems that users saying and update it for one month you just updating this app everyday but still no problem fixed . That's all what i want to say i hope you understand what i really mean Sorry for my English skills 😁,1
"Works for a while, then it stops and doesn't work anymore. Have to uninstall then reinstall. The basic feature works, I think the updated version requires supported phone specifications.",1
"I've been using this for years but only now i have encountered a problem. Suddenly, when I opened the app, the messages kept on loading. I've checked multiple times my internet connection and it was fine. I've also tried clearing cache and data to see if it was the problem. Unfortunately, until now it was still keep loading. I hope you can solve this issue.",1
This lite version of Facebook is a plus where it combines Facebook and messenger in one. The cons is the fonts is not big enough compares to the full version of Facebook app. I urge to be solve this problem ASAP.,1
Page goes blank while scrolling through a person's profile page. Kindly fix this bug. Thank you. Update on my initial review: The problem has been fixed now. Thank you so much.,1
"I'll give it 3 star because sometimes it not work. That means when I want to enter it,it said there are technically problem. So that's why I think the devloper repair this problem or I couldn't but uninstall this app.",1
"okay, Lite is good and has a lot of features and all. But recent updates are really annoying, different issues in every update, then they fix it on the next, then they bring a new one the update after that, then they fix it on the next.. I'm not updating again",1
"Facebook lite is such an interesting app.My number one problem is that,all of a sudden the language has changed from English to another language I don't understand.And please my messages are not coming,anytime I press on messages,they give me a message in a different language I don't understand so please help me out.",1
"Not bad, but still videos play! Again I turn settings option to not autoplay videos, and they always play. Every damn time, even when it's inappropriate. Very annoying. Overall though, it's lite and functional apart from the same old issues with typing that I have with Samsung mobile. But that's not exclusive to this app.",1
"I can't login to my account,this problem happens every time it's annoying,,,repeatedly showing an unexpected error occurrd..please try login in Again.I don't understand what is the problem. ,, I want to fix my account,i want solution. ￼",1
"Can no longer use the app. ""Please upgrade to the supported version"" constant error message upon logging in. And this is after confirming I had the most recent version.",1
"app is good, except sometimes i find it very difficult to open app. i don't know what really happens to cause that. fixing that may earn a 4 or 5 stars next time.",1
"gave this three stars, although it works but it took so long to load messages to the point it needs to uninstall and download again. FIX THIS!!!!!!!",1
After your damned previous. update I couldn't upload photos for comments. After this update also I cannot upload photos for comments.. I think It's better to use some other browser to go to facebook because of your updates.,1
Facebook provide information about many things that we need but it also spread vulgarity as it suddenly shows immoral picks and videos that we don't't even search..I request you to please protect youth from this dirt by improving your app for better experience.,1
"Please fix your updates because when i watch in reels and videos it becomes laggy and i can't watch properly, because of lag in videos.",1
"I can't change my profile pic even tho I already refresh, and reset the app. I also updated your app, but my fb lite still not working well.",1
"All advertising Need to scroll to find my peeps Hardly see peeps to much other stuff we don't care Doctors, ect. No room for my peeps to leave messages. It's become nonthing but commercials I really want to give 2 stars",1
"The app is OK hence why I gave it 3 stars. but you need to clear the bugs, I scroll down or watch a video clip & it refreshes itself or takes me back to my fb home page, I really don't understand in why you have to make a Meta form when the old Facebook is enough!!!",1
"I like the app, but the only thing that bothers me is that i don't have the edit feature of the app. But, it can be used on the accounts I've made recently, I wanted to enable the feature since it is my personal account, I use it for school and stuffs. I would be glad if you respond to this review.",1
"the new feature, using password(encrypted messages) should not add coz I cant recovery any of my old or see any new message came into my inbox even if I enter my encrypted pin😔, please fix this",1
"Great app I must say. But then, how do I keep seeing explicit content on my timeline. I have tried to stop it yet it still keeps coming back 😠",1
I like it because of its connection is sutible ans also it's easy to creat page or acc. It is not same like facebook meta.,1
So true may rating is 5 star ..but 1 thing may app will be this appear will appear everytime notification and since my last search I'll do it's I'll be visited but the prob is what do I nid to be back the Facebook lite app .,1
"I would really recommend this application for individuals who admire the usage of a safe and user freindly application. Facebook lite usually provides it's users with their expectations and demands. however, there are still bugs and glitches yet to be fixed and I'm hoping it gets fixed as soon as possible!",1
"I was very comfortable using Facebook Lite, as I don't feel comfortable using the main Facebook app. I don't know why since last few days I am not able to login facebook lite due to unknown reasons. After many attempts I have not been able to solve this problem. For a few days now, this app usage has dropped to almost z 0.If it continues like this then maybe 1 time I will get bored & stop using facebook, I don't know if it is due to my phone or some other networking problem. Please have a look",1
"Everything about this app is good, phone space is not too small, but when watching videos, it looks like long video reels which is annoying.",1
"Very useful,but all of a sudden on the 6th of March at around 1:30AM it stopped working and I can't get access to my account.when I try to login it says Login failed due to an unspecified error🤦🏻‍♀️",1
overall ok but ONLY the most important thing NOT WORKING regardless of being On - the chat message notifications. I have them on with app and push. I don't want bulky version nor the power hungry messenger app,1
"It's really good in term of other things, but I don't like it when I'm typing a long text and before completing it, the app jus restart and clear everything, it's really annoying and the new update has turned everything down because I can't use my phone back gesture instead I use app gesture . But in all its good. That's why I gave it 3-stars.",1
I can't see comments during a Live stream since yesterday before amd after app update! Its very frustrating where I can't communicate with anyone durimg. The Live stream. Even after Live broadcast i also can't view any comments at all from a Was Live stream!,1
There are issues with the service I was hacked twice. I had to create other account. Suddenly appeared afterany years. Weird by away.,1
"If there is no wifi I use this app for free but for some time it keeps disconnecting and I can't use free, I use it from grameenphone..Bangladesh",1
"Facebook I don't know what's happening I can't open messages again using Facebook lite unless I use Facebook, which if I use Facebook it will lead me to messenger which i don't like messenger. If I press the message icon it will be loading....and will not open For me to chat now I have to use a browers in order to open my messages",1
"I could not believe it when I saw the download teaching people how to hack others. I have been hacked almost 3 years now, money stolen out of my bank, even taking my top up from my account, I have complained to you so many times I have lost count, you haven't even answered Action Fraud. All I want to do is play games as that what the phone was made for, Not be hacked, The phone to be mine again. Thank you",1
"This app is great for budget devices with low specs, the only problem I have with this is I don't have the marketplace icon unlike in the original fb app. I hope you can help me with this",1
Dear Facebook Team Subject:-Login failed due to an unspecified error This problem show happens whenever I try to login and I have been having this problem for 7-10 days. I hope this problem will be fixed soon. •Thank you,1
"Good App but the Messenger is very slow and i cannot type fast? Set on "" Do not Auto Play Videos "" but videos on Ads Autoplay all the time as well as Saregama FB Site.",1
"This app was really good since I have been using it but today,I don't know what is wrong with my account,my account just logged out and I have try to login back,but I couldn't login in please I need to get my account back",1
"this fb lite is very useful app, but i have some problem. The Video Quality of your app is so poor, it's so blurry even if i change the quality to 720. It's still blurred",1
"The app is good but, I am having technical difficulties of videos and reels are not playing even the version is updated and on point",1
back to 3 stars coz i dont know how it is going recently on Lite coz once i am viewing a status it turns off automatically please look into this matter.........but overall it is working good in other places,1
"Tried it out for the sake of it but personally I don't like how big everything is. It doesn't seem too user friendly, going back to the original app because it's nicer to look at",1
"But why not keeping search history? Just from experiencing it and if it continues, without a doubt it will be so boring. If it was a new update, please amendments have to be made and bring back search history.",1
"It will be 3 ads, 6 posts from pages I follow, 8 posts from pages you think I want to see, 4 posts from suggested pages I don't care about, 3 more ads, 3 reels I keep turning off, then finally I see 1 post from a friend before it starts over or you decide to show me posts from 3 weeks ago instead",1
My Facebook account is protected Any time when someone tries to hack my account it report immediately and it's not easily accessible to aby device but my story doesn't put music when I post that's not fair and my face isn't really good without music on my story but I like app because it shows interesting things sometimes and it teaches a lot like reading and writing u learn different languages most times and the app can suggest things you like and no matter what kind of the things you like adr,1
"It's good because we can make conversation offline, but there's a HUGE problem right now, I created an account last year, and now i cannot log in anymore because the password was changed, I don't know why, please fix this... I really need my account... This app is like scam to me... Why I can no longer log in to my account, it says ""wrong password"" even though I saved the password, and when I try to change the password by using my phone number... It says ""wrong password""! Please fix this bug",1
So it just decided to stop working and now I can't get it back.. saying something went wrong to try again. I uninstalled and installed it again and it still says the same thing but overall when it works it's cool and not as expensive on data as the Facebook (not lite).,1
"I have been using the app for over seven years now, and literally I haven't found any problem with it, but since yesterday Wednesday 10 of January 2024, I found out that I can't enter my account on the app it keeps on loading for hours, please I don't know what's going on. I hope you guys fix this issue on time.",1
The facebook lite is really a good app..It help us when we are in trouble.. We didn't have mb..it helps us to communicate each other with out mb..but now it have some changes that..we cant not seen picture with out mb..if you can return us the old facebook lite by which we enjoy chats and pictures also..🙂it will helpful for us..please take look on the matter..,1
Every couple months I have to delete and re-download this app because certain tabs won't open anymore and it continually crashes in spite of being properly up to date. I don't trust it with a lot.,1
"This fb lites is good for people like me who only use free data. I guess even though I only have free data, it's good to use it, I guess it's fast depending on the signal. It's also worth it, it's better to use than the android Facebook. that's because I can't go online when there's no load, but here even if I don't have a load I can go online. that's the only difference between the two of them. so I'll give it 3 stars",1
"everytime that i add something to my account. i couldn't see it but then when i touch the ""view as"" i saw it like what the heck?? is this some bug or something?? please fix this..",1
Amazing app but it would be better if we could reciece notification if any one we follow post Receiving notifications is very important for social media apps like this Pls add notifications when people we follow post,1
"There is a glitch after clicking ""see photo"" to a censored violent or graphic content, you will still not able to view it.",1
Videos or reels upload option is not available in my lite Facebook. Please solve this problem as soon as possible.,1
"it was great before the new update, it's annoying to just delete a convo, come on remove the new update, we don't need it",1
"When i scroll next video sound is muted or error, in every scroll it needs 2 times for sound incoming please fix this issue Thank You",1
It's a good app so I'm just giving it three out of five goods recently it's been giving me problems I can't use my messages I can't see them so I don't know why I don't know if the internet is low but it's the only thing that I can say but it's a good app by the way guys,1
This app is quite okay but sometimes it keep loading for hours and never opens. I don't know who but this is too much,1
It is good but u need just to Link it with the audience in original Facebook so as to our reels and videos reach both of the audience Facebook lite and original,1
It's good but it will be more better if we have delete option....... Like delete all the chat at once 🌚deleting one by one is so annoying,1
The app is a good one to use though Lately the app started misbehaving And I'm having issues with the friend request I can't send friend request to people,1
"Everythime when I am in Facebook Lite playing the games on there it says I have to log in to regular Facebook all the time for no reason, please fix that problem now",1
"it's fine tho, the Fonts keeps changing, and it's so annoying, i can't read the messages properly because the fonts are to big(poor eyesight) and even tho you changed the fonts at the settings it keep changing on her own, i uninstalled it again for the same reason.",1
I'm confused....the other app consistently gives wrong location.....this one gives me my chrome location ...chrome has been hacked before,1
I have been using this app for a while now but my only problem with it Is that I can't post reels on my page or check my dashboard,1
Fine but very buggy. I get that it's a Lite version but that's not really an excuse. Messenger Lite doesn't have these issues,1
Good app but im going to give it 3 stars because sometimes it skips status and it reduces quality when i post my videos using it please help us fix this i love your app,1
"It always cut off my post . That's quite annoying! Other than that, I think it's a great app.",1
"It's is good app but it is dangerous for health 😅 Because we use 24 hours and it is can't good in our daily life .Living with these social media apps, we have forgotten real life Give answer Yes /No",1
"Private message should be enable to be edited incase of any misspelled word or error. I mean a button of edit message should be added, if I long press on the message I want to edit. instead of to delete the whole message and retype again because of error is better to add a edit button!!!",1
"Theres always something wrong, u guys fix 1 thing only to screw up 3 other previously working features... I never auto-update + I delay doing so until the comments from those who DID update the latest version have stopped posting 2 ☆☆ reviews bc it blew up their phone. I literally had 2 install both fb lite and reg fb bc half fb versions drain the hell outta my battery overwriting all my restrictions on bankround batt and app usage.",1
Android 13. I'm looking down the posts and part way through viewing a post it switches to the latest post. Very annoying.,1
Been trying to find an option for updating the app with no luck as I have been unable to use messenger for days 🥺,1
For the last 24 hour I haven't been able to send messages to people A side from that all my reels are in another language,1
It takes much data in baground and whenever I open new chat it is not open chat.,1
"This app is very needed from me,because fb lite is be powerful for me,i dont may english grammar is perfect but is okay",1
"I do not understand what Facebook is upto with all this 10 times update, it is annoying really.",1
Notifications used to let me see more faster but as of a couple days ago it freezes up and goes haywire etc...,1
I just love the app cos it doesn't take space on your phone and it's easy to use.,1
"Very good but there new system of update now is not good, they will log you out and you will not access anything again unless you update it",1
"i can't open my fb lite, i don't know why but i cannot open it, like what?? i tried deleting it and install it, but it doesn't work",1
I love this app but here is one problem with this app is it has no option of reel I can't watch reel on it so please fix this 😊,1
"After restricted my account, I try to login Facebook again so I can create new account, the app was not opening untill I uninstalled and install again,,",1
why is my reaction emoji doesn't move just like the others? ive always updating fb lite. and then why cant i see the # of followers on my timeline anymore and also the people who view my Myday who isnt my friend? kindly fix it,1
"It's good but it's not helping me to recover my old account even in the original Facebook App, It's always telling me to go to Facebook/Login/Identify but their questions are literally the same it's going over and over again like it's kinda irritating me. I would be glad if they can help me recover my account even if I don't have the same device as the one I had when I'm using my old account because it'll be helpful for those who lost their phone and trying to get their account back,respond pls",1
"I hate this new update on the part of viewing statuses, when you press the like button it doesn't indicate that you clicked the like button, no animation, no clicking sound or any indication that shows that your like has been sent or something",1
"Facebook is such a very interesting app since I started using it until today when I open it ,it won't open but there is nothing wrong with my internet connection too. Please try and fix this very soon because it is really affecting some of us. Thank you.",1
"I loved it but unfortunately, I uninstalled it and installed it back. after logging in,l can no more send messages, like l can't even view my messages. It keeps saying ""preparing your messages, please wait. It has been saying that for about a month Please help me get rid of it because I need to do something with friends",1
"This app went from one of the most convenient to become the most useless ones in one day. When I tried to open the app it says I'm using an unsupported version, that I should upgrade. I do just that and it still says the same thing.",1
I really love this app it keeps old picture of you and when it's your birthday it send those pictures to u it sometimes look emotional.,1
"It's good,but when i log in i encountered the "" login failed due to unspecified error""",1
The layout for app with my phone. IDK. But it's what was available on phone.,1
"This app is alright, problem is you can't edit a message when sent",1
"When you forward videos to someone it end up telling you, Couldn't send. Why?",1
Very slow respoñse may be because of this phone only 3G network.,1
Sometimes stuck this app I can't download any videos in this app. It's bad,1
"my experience to it was nice not until my account was restricted and i don't know why, please Facebook team fix this",1
the app it taking to long to pick the keyboard and hanging almost all time,1
"It's good app, but even i have a load or internet,,, there's something's wrong,,,FACEBOOK LITE messenger is not open😩",1
"I notice that ICT workers are abusing their power to block me to upload the Facebook Katana app I bought my device a year ago and I can't open the Facebook apk app due to not parse problems I am a reproduction victim and the organization is so well structured that they following all my steps on the internet ,What's app and telecommunications And the only app they'd selected for me on the App store is Facebook lite because they use monitoring features to control me on the internet",1
"every time I log out of the account, I need to enter the password again and all of a sudden the account logs out",1
I am having problem with adding friends and I have reported this and update the app but still nothing,1
No work smoothly so improve it's speed. thank you 🥰,1
This an amazing app of all time But one thing most people want Is to choose wich part of the song to play on the stories We have favorite songs but we want a specific part of the music to play Not for Facebook to choose for us Please fix the problem,1
I don't know what happen with my FB After updating my FB My message cannot load any longer and it Is writing message can't load U guyz should fix it,1
Its always updating pls try fixing it and updating message pls try fixing it,1
I like this app is good and i like the new update but the new navigation system is broken. I have use it on my phone three buttons,1
nice app but sometimes when i try to watch something or repeat something it's so log that it has many adds too i hope this helps and fix tho.,1
It is very simple and very useful for everyone more than original,1
When I log in to my other account it takes so long to log in back again to my other account it takes many hours!,1
"Can't open my messages, it keeps saying messages unavailable Please help",1
There is this bug with this current build where the lower half of the app turns white. This only happens once or twice a week and it only happens when I'm on the feeds page,1
I've used this app for years and it hasn't failed me. This new update though is kinda slow and lagging,1
"Videos are basically lottery on this platform. Ex: You find something interesting and want to watch it full screen, you click on the video and suddenly it just turns black... It's black when you go full screen too. Then you cidentally change tabs or hit back putton and pufff you lost the video you were watching.. Where is it? God knows... There is absolutely no way to find a video you recently watched. Great experience.",1
Needs an update February 22nd is not working on this phone ZTE can see it but is not staying up to use it.,1
"I switched to Facebook Lite, but I had to put Facebook back in because most of my games & things wouldn't work until I downloaded Facebook. But I like Facebook Lite better. It's the only one I like using. I don't want to have to delete Facebook Lite but if you won't let me update, will it stop working?",1
I love the basic mode of facebook lite very much but since few days my facebook lite is not working in basic mode due to which I am facing various problems.Can anyone help me?,1
"I have uninstalled and reinstalled this app many times. When it's working, all is good. Once in a while, it gets stuck in a particular post and won't let me exit (when I try to go back, it goes a page or two then stops or returns to the original page I was stuck on). When this happens, I have to uninstall and reinstall to get it working again. It could be pretty good but goes glitchy from time to time. I'd use regular FB but I'm trying to conserve space on my phone.",1
"Messenger lite gets scrapped and I'll be forced to use this instead (or the bloated, slow, ad-filled junk that is the full messenger app). It'd be fine if only I could use it in landscape mode when messaging. Also someone mentioned the blackout issue when scrolling down on a profile. Moreover, the bottom of the screen has a white stripe. It's been there for years, and only in this app.",1
"Consumes lesser data and memory compared to the original FB app as the name implies. I expected and taken into account the classic UI as well since it is a lite version. However, it seems to lack some features and it has limited options. For example, when changing profile picture, you can't turn off the option post on news feed. I just prefer changing my profile photo without it appearing on my friends' news feed and notifying anyone, you know. There's more, however, I reached the text limit ;(",1
"I like that it doesn't take up as much space as the full version but that's because it doesn't have the bells and whistles. So polls, checking in to places etc. But when you can't even see a whole post ('see more' doesn't work) or manage your page or groups properly it gets to be an issue! Had to uninstall and go back to the full version. Keeping messenger lite though.",1
"The app is good for a space saver if you don't plan on downloading the main Facebook app. Still, there are still some issues that needs to be improve and fix. Copying links in the messages is difficult and creating chat groups is unavailable. The loading time for the news feed is unresponsive most of the time. I hope these problems would be adressesd.",1
"I really do love this ""lighter"" version of Facebook because I'm a simple and straightforward type of guy. However, I have noticed for the past week or so that I cannot watch live streams nor can I play back the videos later on. The videos think, load, freeze, think, load, freeze. Regular Facebook doesn't seem to have this problem but I don't like that version as well because there's too much going on. I know it's not just my phone causing these problems as I have tried them on a new phone too..",1
"I have always chosen facebook lite over other facebook apps because it is hassle free. However, the recent updates have a problem. I keep getting notifications of the same things over and over again. It gets so that whenever I connect to the internet, I can get notifications on likes, comments, posts, etc, dating from two weeks back, all at the same time, and they all carry the time ""now"", like it was a recent event. Even when I disconnect and reconnect, all those notifications come in. Again.",1
"This app is ok Lighter, takes up less space than full FB app. There are issues sometimes (my notifications don't show up after not thinks I read them)... But it's less glitchy than Friendly. Some functionality is lost, eg you can't prioritize a page in your feed when you like the page, etc. But it's good for keeping in touch, and tagging folks in your posts etc that some FB skin apps don't do well.",1
"Slow forward a few years and it definitely better than 2019. It actually works, which helps. The app size is growing though. A great idea, replace the overweight Facebook app with bare bones functionality. Sadly, it is far from ideal. Slow, clunky and after 3 days has become unresponsive. After watching a blue screen with two pulsing squares for 10 minutes it is being uninstalled.",1
"The Facebook Lite app is a fast and easy way to stay con nected with friends and family. It's perfect for using on 2G networks, so you can remain linked even when there's no signal. And also, you can access all the features of Facebook, consisting of sharing to a timeline, liking images, looking for people, and also editing and enhancing your account and also groups. So why wait? Download the Facebook Lite app today!",1
"I just installed Facebook Lite few days ago. The overall experience is quite the same as the original version. It quickly loads and refreshes the newsfeed, less ads, distracting videos, and can go to posts of the original poster. The only problem I'm experiencing is whenever I type/press spacebar, it deletes my previously typed text. I reinstalled Lite twice and also tested if my phone keyboard have problems, but it works fine. I hope devs can fix this, I'm liking the experience with Lite.",1
"This app would have a glowing recommendation from me as someone without the phone storage to have the full app AND no computer... except it doesn't work with Messenger Lite. In order to message people I have to go to the Chrome Mobile Site which defeats the whole purpose of having the app in the first place. I like the minimalistic look, that it loads more than six photos in a series, lack of infinity scrolling etc. But I have to uninstall until the messages are fixed.",1
"When there was notification about reply , never shown up.",1
"Many glitches. To be fair, I use this app every day. But I report often when things don't work and they don't get fixed. Reactions don't work frequently, I can't toggle off sounds (I don't understand why I have to have noisy buttons and the option is there to mute them but it doesn't work.) Other frequent glitches, etc. I use this version bc I don't care about messages or gifs and it is lite, but the support just isn't there.",1
Well I have about 6 account's my phone has been stolen and every time I end up making a new account. now it ran by meta and it's a joke but anyways I do love Facebook all my friends and family are on it,1
"If there is enabled ""crop"" option in story editing, the fb lite would be more interesting...........",1
Im using this app but when i want to post a story it is not showing me music option....i tried to update but still its not showing,1
"Entertaining application. A better version than the original Facebook because you can ""view"" all of your notifications without actually viewing them and that way the app doesn't push you to open them anymore. Still needs work: I regularly have issues saving a post. Also, some things in the app are badly designed, like how when you open a friend's post that they have shared, it shows you other random videos, not other videos that the friend has shared.",1
It's a good application but what I concerned about is why tf I can't use the other emoji's on this app,1
"The app is good itself. I've been using this for a year or two and it doesn't have me problem like it does now. So listen to me alright, when you create an account there are two options which is the basic/text or data mode okay? But what I hate is that, my account doesn't have those options. It's usually on the top corners on your feed but where the hell are mine?? It's really been a hassle to me since it won't open if you're not in WiFi or doesn't have data to consume.",1
"I'm beginning to love this app, it's becoming interesting than before, I hope future updates will make things more interesting. I'd have given it 5stars but we in Nigeria are not allowed to monentize our accounts, that was why I took out 2 stars Hope this will be available soon.",1
Why can't I add friends? And yesterday while I was adding friends it was showing an error has occurred....?,1
"I have an issue with the text appearing everywhere in this app. I use a Coolpad Note 5. The text gets overlapped with the next line, gets cut off in the middle etc. Even after refreshing, updating and reinstalling. This happens with newsfeed timeline and inbox texts all over. This has been happening only for around the past week, and I had no such issues before that. Developer please provide support.",1
"Nice overall. Like someone before me addressed, loading time needs to be improved as it takes too long for no apparent reason. Also, uploading photos from the camera roll is REALLY bothersome when you wanna make a post, specially when you have thousands of pics, on groups; it'd be better if it allowed other apps to work as explorers just like Twitter Lite does, so it helps users save time.",1
"It hasn't been good since the last update. I don't have access to my messages in messenger . Everytime i try opening them it says ""still preparing messages keep using fb. The fb provides the same feed and it's making me mad.",1
Please bring the option to share image via Messenger/Whatsapp etc. like the Facebook app.,1
"i satisfy, nd i agree facebook lite is best part of my memories.",1
"*Can't play multiple videos. Like for example when someone posted 4 videos only 1 video is played. When you open the other video still the first video was played. *When you go to video, you need to reload it 3 times before it plays. *Stories are not visible unless you visit someone's wall. *It cuts the bottom of the photos *There's always a bug",1
Facebook Lite should follow the dark mode of the system. Overall it's working fine.,1
I no longer have access to log into my Facebook account.my Facebook lite no longer stable to login to my account plz I seriously need it assistant,1
"I prefer the lite variant of Facebook (thanks to it's lessened Tracking, lighter battery footprint and connectivity when signal drops, which is nice in rural Wales.) However, I have had technical difficulties with my BlackBerry KeyOne. Such as font corruption, making everything unable to be read, and huge black boxes when I scroll away from videos. I'm assuming these bugs are due to my device's unusual aspect ratio, however this greatly harms usability. I hope these issues are patched eventually",1
"It's a good alternative to the full facebook app, however there are a lot of things that need to be fixed. The app is prone to random freezes and crashes. Posts do not always load or submit, especially if accompanied with tags or photos. For this reason I've had to reluctantly unininstall. Aside from these issues its a great idea.... strips facebook back to original ease of use and simplicity.",1
"It's good but I find it hard to change my password, I used 2 of my contacts to register the account and unfortunately one of the sim cards got missing and the missing number is to which the short code is always sent to change my password",1
So borig app 🥴🥴,1
Vwry nice L,1
Chatting is always showing unavailable why ?,1
"The app is very easy and fun to use but it could use some upgrades. For starters, a feature that enables one to search for a message sent long ago, because it can be hard to scroll for a long time looking for just one message. I hope you take this into consideration",1

"Facebook Lite have good features that Facebook don't have. The same thing goes with the original Facebook app. But I like Facebook Lite better. But recently, whenever I comment pictures, it just loads but it doesn't appear in the comments. So I still have to go to Facebook to just comment that pic. Which is annoying because it's time consuming. Also whenever I'm scrolling and reading the comments in reels, the comments disappear after scrolling a little bit. Please fix this",1

"As someone who doesn't use Facebook, but still uses messenger to talk to family, this is perfect. It's not taking up a bunch of space, and while it doesn't run great, its a legacy version of fb meant for older phones, so no, of course its not going to run as smooth. The issues are to be as expected.",2
"This is ridiculous. Every week something goes wrong that you don't recognize my password. Now I can't access fb because I have to upgrade. It takes me here, and gives no option to upgrade. I deleted and reinstalled, just to have to change password yet again, and still can't access fb because I have to upgrade. Edit. Things since then have improved. I am now able to access from all of my devices. Thank you. Only problem now is accessing video chats from this version.",2
"I decided a years ago to skip on buying costly flagship phones. I didn't realize the challenge it would bring in regards to phone memory, storage and performance. Well to make a long story short... Facebook lite helped by giving me most of the functionality at a fraction of the memory cost of the regular Facebook. Now that I have upgraded phones, I will check to see how the two apps function. Maybe I'll just continue to use Facebook lite 😁",2
"If Facebook is going to insist on bundling their app with my phone, this is the version they should include. It doesn't look quite as pretty, but it also doesn't kill your battery or data plan like the ""full version"" does. I'm glad Facebook is making an effort to cater to older devices, but I recommend this version of the app to all of my clients, no matter what device they have. It's far more resource-efficient than the full version, and still includes all the features they need.",2
"This app doesn't use so much data and storage space as the full app, and it runs more smoothly. Sometimes, you miss out on weird new stuff, like certain games, but that's not too important to me. The only problem I have is that when a post in another language is too long, sometimes it won't let me click ""See More"" after choosing ""See Translation,"" so I might not get to read the full text. Overall, it's a better experience.",2
"Hopefully, in the near future I will say what this app does well. For now I'm only going to mention the things that it could do better: 1. Include in the App's settings, its notification sound. 2. Enable prioritization of notifications and how frequently to receive them. 3. Fine tune notifications, so it automatically goes to the post mentioned in the notice.",2
"Lighter on the storage, and still has dark mode. Can't use gifs or certain animations, but that's too small of a problem to really matter anyway! And doesn't have landscape view but phone can override it sometimes. UPDATE: Now I've been getting a white bar that takes up about a third of the screen (Z Fold 3 unfolded) occasionally. Maybe a fix in an update, you could enable ""continue apps on cover screen""",2
"I absolutely enjoy the Facebook application on my Android mobile! It actually helps me stay connected with buddies and passions, plus it's a terrific way to store, conserve, and also share images. It's so simple to take images directly from the camera as well as I have complete control of that sees what. With the capability to maintain specific photos personal or perhaps produce a secret image album, I feel confident that my photos are safe. Very recommend!",2
This is much better than the other version. This one isn't bloated so it's not a huge drain on the battery. No automatic feed update so you don't lose track of the post you are commenting on or have a post buried that you were going to go back and read. I haven't had any issues personally with errors but I'll update if I do. Recommended if you want a less glaring experience.,2
"This does not slow down my phone near as much as the full-blown Facebook app. One flaw is when I'm watching a Facebook video in full screen landscape mode, if I lay the phone down flat then it flips back every time into the smaller portrait mode orientation. The only way around this that I have found this to prop the phone up and not lay it down flat. If you could fix this then I would gladly rate you five stars. Using LG-V20.",2
"A lot like the regular FB app. The only real issues for me with the ""Lite"" version are the 'sometimes' difficult problems uploading large image files & the responsiveness of the app as a whole when opening links compared to the full version. All in all not bad & a good use to have one account always signed into FB Lite & the other in FB regular without having to log out/log in.",2
"I do like how the app does not take up as much space on my phone as the regular version. One of my minor quibbles is not being able to see all the comments on news pages or be given the option to do so. I'm not as interested in how the algorithm wants me to engage with the material. Also, I shouldn't have to upload any contacts into the app for a friend's list that already exists.",2
"I love this Lite version of Facebook because it doesn't take up nearly as much space as the full app. It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles the full version has however, so you won't be able to do some of the things that you would be able to do normally. If you have an older or cheaper phone without a lot of memory space, but still want to remain connected with friends/family, this is the perfect, stripped down app version for you.",2
This is a good alternative app to the regular FB app. It is light ad does not use up a lot of phone space. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the ads. Especially the regular FB app ad that keeps popping up. Does not make sense because it's the reason I chose this light app. It eat up too much space!,2
"I'm pretty sure that most people use the lite version than the original Facebook because it's simple and fast to use. Nothing is perfect, messenger still takes so long to load and it usually notifies me on a message after I've already replied to it. When watching reels, or when you are sent a video, when you download it, it doesn't actually download it. Whether you've tried spamming the download button, or waiting for the bar to display ""download completed"", you'll never find the video anywhere.",2
"Please add the option to open all links in default browser instead of in app browser, just like the option present in the full version Facebook app. Its weird that a lite version of the app even has an in app browser without any option to change that .",2
It's better than the old version if you just try to be more understanding to what new features was displayed then you can use the app more satisfying. New features can make you lost while using the app but when you are done adjusting then you can say the app was good enough for a high rate,2
"Still my fav option for social media, its been more than a decade, that was a lots of memories. Note: I dont like when image view got cutted and need user to click to view full image, it doesn't worth the time.",2
"Lighter version of the very bloated full version. Only one complaint: I don't see how to turn off auto-refresh. It's particularly annoying when it happens while I'm writing a post, or reading a long post.",2
"Hi there, I've facing a problem on Facebook lite version that, when I open a photo story it opens but with in half second goes to new one & it's continuously happening till a video story. Is there any solution? Tnx...",2
Nice app but the problem is that you cannot use Facebook for long. It reaches daily limit in a short time. I humbly request if you can add from 15 daily mbs to 50 mbs daily so that we can be able to use it for long because we have Facebook groups which we use in chatting and we Miss a lot after a daily limit. I'll be grateful if you will do some settings so that we can be able to send videos in the messenger just like When sending images it doesn't bring real pic. Make it look clear like WhatsAp,2
"Reporting a bug: During commenting, as soon as first character is entered, comment box gets minized, hiding keypad. Entered character remains in text box. After that, when touched the comment box again, able to continue writing comment. The initial character hiding textbox needs to be addressed.",2
"Although some changes are great, many bug/glitch are still there, such as the auto refresh bug that made videos/reels become unclickable and unplayable. I hope mark will try to fix it.",2
"2nd feb 24. I reinstalled FBLite app, after I messaged a friend from FBLite and we were able to video chat. The following day now in the app messaging people doesent have the video and voice call options. Whats going on with this? Samsung tab A 10.1 2018 with Android 10.",2
"the app is good, v easy to use but the recent update is giving me a headache. the update on the font size is not really accurate, i wanted small size font but it’s giving me a medium sized one, at first i thought it was only a bug but days passed it’s still the same. as a minimalist person, i don’t enjoy the new updates on the font sizes. please bring it back on how it used to be, but if it’s a bug please fix it.",2
"Will give 5 stars if only the issue I had is with marketplace is fixed. Everytime I try to open the map of the seller, it will open Google maps buat with ""Unsupported link, Google Maps can't open this link.""",2
"It's a good App, but Marczukerbeg consider including a provision for voice notes on the comment section it will be a great feature I tell you as it will make it easier for some people who don't like typing.. Thank me later. PAUL JAY ZAMBIA 🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲",2
"a great app i can say and it's improving tho. the only problem in this app is when you try to download a photo(s) in a message, the resolution is very low. please fix it.",2
"quite fresh but it has been by far the worst experience on a dating site, and it has left me sick to my stomach! It's a lot to read, so sit down with a hot cup of tea or whatever preffered beverage. So I matched with this guy, J, and we had an awesome conversation right away, great chemistry and all that, and we hit it off pretty quick; He mentioned he had kids, and they would always come first, which is not a problem for me at all!",2
It's nice ...been using the app for years now and it's really great...but you gotta work on the update... sometimes It's not easy for me to log into my account...,2
"I began experiencing some issues after a year of using fb Lite. I have to log in twice ....when the fb is closed automatically, or I logged out. It's OK but I may missed important updates in the first login.",2
"the update is worst , I can't do comments and react and its almost 4 days i can't do comment and like can you fixed it i really like this apps but the update now is not good. its keep saying will appear when you online",2
"I'm having a good experience with the app overall, but I found an issue when I wanted to delete multiple photos. Everytime I delete a photo, it goes back to the main screen, which hinders my progression towards deleting my photos, which is annoying. It should also have the option to delete multiple photos at once.",2
"Social media motivates me specialty good, I feel like zoon politicon and persona iuris civilis gives me new freedom, the group options are individual and personal relevant, and the story option allows me to express my feelings and gives me possibility to receive taste and style visually and audio too is a possibility, to share my interests makes me happy, I would miss it finally, thank you...😂",2
Actually good app cause you will used with or without data but when you upload a video it's become short mb you can't upload a full video even you have strengthening data.I actually used too update on this app on Facebook but I can't used as this app like I also content a video,2
This app is really amazing & has funny content & since the update it's even better with the new options in our inboxes I love it .. I just hate the unnecessary notifications about pages changing their names just wish they could stop,2
"Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their friend or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the act",2
"Im using fb lite for a long time and i am satisfied with it but i have problem some time into calling so, please add the calling feature both video and audio.",2
Lately it has been noticed that my fb lite app has stopped working. I tried updating it but it never worked. So I'll just use chrome to log into facebook.,2
For the past few days it has been sending me messages about my account. It always interrupts me with this particular message. But other than that I think the app is worth it,2
"Easy and clean. Feature request: Please make it so you can choose the FB section you want the app to open on. I don't want to be on the black hole that is my feed. I just want to be able to pop in and see if any of my pinned groups have updates and then hop back off, so I would love to be able have the app open in Groups > Your Groups. Since FB discontinued their dedicated groups app, there is no longer an easy way to do that.",2
"THIS IS AN UNSUAL THING TO HAPPEN, TODAY I'M JUST TRYING TO OPEN THIS APP TO SEND TEXT TO MY FRIEND ABOUT AN IMPORTANT THING ABOUT SCHOOL THEN IT WONT MAKE ME LOG IN EVEN THROUGH MESSENGER IT ALWAYS KEEPS ME SIGNED OUT AND WHEN I TRY TO PUT MY PASSWORD IN, IT KEEPS TELLING THAT THERE WAS AN ERROR AND WONT LOG IN TO MY ACC! PLEASE FIX THIS.. Also I updated this app It still doesn't work either..",2
Facebook lite is very aesome app. Easy to use and very simple. It has issue to log in id .it ask to about an anexpacted error.please fix this error.,2
This is good but the one i really get angry about is when you accidentally tap the use data button when you don't have a load and then you won't be able to use fb lite until you get your cp loaded,2
"Facebook are very good built app and with great features everything is good and OK But recently Facebook are now too found of account restrictions 13 days, 6 days and even too much locking is so common in the Facebook app and I would advise that it should reduce the aspect of locking people's accounts at least restriction is OK than locking accounts please",2
I don't know the reasons but nowadays Facebook lite has open a link for many hackers where you find your account being used by someone you don't know. So please make sure our privacy is granted. Thank you.,2
Finally it has the dark theme.👍 But it doesn't have the feature to crop the photo/video while uploading it.,2
"App has been crashing since the recent update. Clicking to view fb stories and it crashes, please, fix!",2
"I have a problem which i have been facing since last year September i can't post any reel whenever i try its always giving me a green blank video, pls the management should work on the app so it will be easy for me thank you",2
Not so good. My live video productions are not rotating even after turning on the auto rotate function on my device.,2
"It's great for texting ,watching videos and all that stuff but i can't put some music on my story",2
It's good but I'd appreciate it if they removed the bug where I can't change my username even though 60 days have already passed,2
This is the best communication app I can use to download video and pictures but I can't log into my account it's telling me that after 162 days they will block it pls I need your help I don't want my account to be blocked 🥺🥺😟😟🥺🥺🙏🙏,2
"It's been a great time with this app. I love the interface and the Click sounds. But, I don't know what happens sometimes when it's to be launched it doesn't launch sometimes even when the network is strong. But, barring that, it's all good to me. I give it 4 star because of the network issue.",2
"Hi Facebook! This app is absolutely fine and awesome! Though, I just want to report a bug that I encountered yesterday. My friend hid the total reactions of her post, but it can be seen through this app (Facebook lite). The 'bug' can be seen by clicking the photo and see where the symbol '👍' is located. Thank you! *I'm sorry I can't speak English very well*",2
"The app is amazing.... Truly good and the navigation system just works as good But the developers should make a change in the professional dashboard, where we can create ads .... The payment method.... Instead of bank card they should also put another payment method like bank account name and account number so that people can still get payed even without bank card.... I sure hope this problem will be attended to",2
"This app is great for sending messages or rather posting some updates to your accounts. I rated it 4 stars, cuz I have only one problem though. I hope that it can have a feature that can cancel or undo a reaction to some stories, because sometimes I accidently push some reaction emojis.",2
it's great app however recently they are not working properly like I can't read when some one mention me or I can't search another fb accounts shortly there is problems in their search ...thank You,2
"I'm supposed to give it five stars but what can I say? The app refuses to open, It says it needs update which I updated. But every twenty four hour it'll still need an update. This is frustrating. Imagine having to update the app for everytime you want to use it. I just updated again. This is the sixth update this week.",2
"Not perfect. You can't expect any Facebook App to be. However this version is the best out all others. I Love that in this Facebook App, A Separate Messenger App is not Necessary. That's how Facebook worked when it was first made. Your Facebook Users have told you that ever since you separated Messenger from Facebook to begin with. Thank You for Listening and Finally developing a Facebook App with the Messenger included like it once was.",2
"It has been really great! I've learnt so much & while distributing so much as well ' in terms of communicating to my loved this app have played a big role & I appreciate that so much we love Facebook as thee Facebook users me & my friends school whatever pictures, videos etc is really enjoyable on the app thanks for the APK & we wish this app doesn't ever get closed , cancelled or even changed everything about it is massive, entertaining & amazing to us we learn ,explore & conquer with the App!",2
"A tiny bit laggy but other than that I like this way more than the full version, plus I can access my messages without having to have Facebook Messenger installed.",2
"I am unable to delete messages. They reappear over and over. Can't turn off ""suggestions for you"" nor ""People you May Know"" annoying.",2
"Although i am kinda disappointed because it often crash lags whenever I am watching, I like the new features of Facebook lite specially that profile lock👍👍",2
"no lock profile same as the original again when you needed it, it just vanish what a weird devs making a test of profile lock and then removing it again",2
"Facebook lite is a good advantageous app that I like most ,it helps to stay connected to friends and family,I chose 4stars because u can not save / upload videos Posted on ur screen but pictures can be saved. U can even create more than 3 accounts too!💝👌",2
"this app is so amazing and so basic to use, butttt i have suggestions... hope the meta community will heard this i would love it if the reactions can be customize like messenger, the messenger is good but too much bugs so i prefer this app rather than mess.",2
Freezes when I tap on a photo on marketplace.. can't get out.. was hoping for an update to fix it.,2
"Facebook Is easy to use and navigate,making it accessible to a wide range of users.facebook has a massive global reach making it to a popular platform for connecting with friends,family and business Facebook Is the best 👌",2
It was great when it doesn't show massage delivered bt now it's shows as like messenger...it's very worst..please stop this feature...that's why I rating 4..,2
"Its so convinient to have a facebook lite because you can easily open it and this app hasany features regarding prayers.quotes,and many others.thank you for this app and you can install plenty of features.",2
"I can't seem to find a Facebook app for Chromebook on play store. Even though I do a search and enter for Chromebook all I get is android resizable which don't work good when you make them bigger. They also seem to have forgotten types of videos I like I scroll for hours not to hear about some average woman's day, or the Bakersfield police just on surveillance until the day the Sun goes Nova. I admit that I'm not the most skilled user, but in these times it should be easier to find adjustments.",2
I've been using this app since years but now whichever video I have downloaded I couldn't see it the option isn't opening and saying it has a problem so please solve it,2
"I like the apps but sometimes it fools it's annoying to use sometimes but it's good,fb lite is good for communicating with those who are far away so it's okay for me",2
2012 up to now is my favorite choice network.. learning many thing.. additional tip is about mental health and security.. you should consider bcoz I was one of victim from unknowns.. anyway like you Mark Z..,2
"Nice...But if someone sends a video on messenger along with messaging here, that video could be downloaded then it would be great.",2
I rate a 4 because it doesn't have free mode but another people have free mode but anyway it works perfect love it 🤘❤️🔐,2
Very good app but there is usually a bug I experienced recently it deletes some of my friends anytime I have network issues,2
"This is a great short app,,!! But you have should to give on this app video call and audio call,,,",2
"Update: New Problem, Stories on my newsfeed are bothering when I'm scrolling down on my newsfeed. It's really annoying especially everytime I'm playing music, they're interrupting my musics where the only thing i should hear was my music and not those stories on my newsfeed. Old Problem, Whenever I'm saving a post or reels, i can't put it in my collection no matter what i do even if i go to ""save"" and try to put in on collection, it doesn't show. Hope you guys can fix it, thanks in advance.",2
"I like fb lite because you can't find anything on fb lite, everything is on him, chat, video call, etc.",2
Easy way to get someone without their phone number or other informations . One problem hackers they are so annoying,2
It doesn't allow me to read my message but all the time saying update facebook messenger even if you updated it just then,2
I just going to give this a 4 star rate because there are some error pls fix this and my Facebook and also messenger are in error too.,2
"Wow, so amazing app Always notified me on live videos, I have been using it to even chart with friends and family",2
Though my face dey worry something's egg but I just like the way it provides data as free mood to me when I no get data but it should allow me post videos when i no get data too abeg to make your customers happy,2
"Good app always, for chatting in any country and communicate with anybody that you know also people that you are not with their mobile number",2
"Facebook is working as a great means of communication for us. We are all aware of that. We are benefited by it so much that we all bow down to its owner. We have some accounts that are very important to us. Some of our accounts have been banned from Facebook which is very unfortunate for us. Which none of us want. Therefore, our request to the Facebook company is that if you return our previous band accounts, we would be very happy. So we hope we will get our Facebook accounts back.",2
"Uhmm my experience here,in fb lite is...good but i cant mayday properly(i cant add more photo on it)But this app is good ,its not slow.So i rate it 4/5",2
"I only give four stars because of the ad popping up.The ads that popping up are all sexually content,which is very inappropriate for a very a young age.Please fix these issues,very sexually inappropriate...I loved this app because its useful in communication, entertainment,and very cool.",2
Its great because u can chat and scroll at once but theres too many bug like logging in your account,2
I love lite but I'm having an when ever I entered the app my phone will restart Pls check if the faulty is from the app and fixed it for me immediately,2
"It's really nice, I'm so glad that there's a Facebook lite, I couldn't install the original one, I don't know why, but I am already good cause there's a second ver of it, thanks for making this, I love the features, and It doesn't lag that much, it's nice I'll give this 4 stars, I'll save the another star Incase there's other problem that I probably still haven't gotten yet, I'm sorry and thank you.",2
"Let me hope this message reaches to the responsible ones,i had fun when I was using this app,but while I was surfing in the app, i by mistake clicked on an unavailable account,i thought it was easy to get the current account back in a jiffy.but boy was I wrong, until now am trying to re-sign in but it won't work, even if I use my password and username and email it. Just won't work i even tried getting a new account it won't work, what i want to know is that if i was burned from Facebook. Or not,",2
"Not good at all, it always appear that ""this app isn't corresponding? Close app or wait"" it appears on my keyboard and I accidentally click the close app while I'm typing and all messages that I have type all gone, and I should start over again. 😭",2
"everything had been great not untill today 25th/12/2023 when i got a notification that i jave reached the friend limit. Wait, what why limit me on the number of friends i should have. am kindly requesting that this feature should be disabled so that we can have as many friends as we can, am not ordering it is just a request. PLEASE KINDLY REMOVE THE FRIEND LIMIT FEATURE FROM THE APP SO THAT 2E CAN HAVE AS MANY FRIENDS AS WE WANT. I WILL BE GLAD IF I RECEIVE A NOTIFICATION THAT THIS ISSUE IS SOL.",2
I really love this app and it is designed perfectly but there's always some issues,2
Could do much more in terms of when someone makes a comment y'all at FB headquarters quick to band person all bcoz the person speak there mind,2
"The only problem that I have with this app is that I can't search anything I want. From there... it's a good app,it is accurate.",2
"Facebook lite shows notification on application but when I open it, there was no any notification",2
I love this app well well,2

The app is great only that after logging in it's annoying my account is receiving restrictions from liking stories for 24 hours everyday when the first restriction is over again I receive another one. I tried to report this nothing was done like to work upon the matter. Now I'm confused where the problem is. Is it with the app or with the Facebook employees. So work upon that meta team. Thanks,2

"Does exactly what you'd expect, and I mean that in a good way. It gives you only the most important features, and uses simpler layouts and functionality. In exchange, the app loads insanely fast, and barely even touches your battery in the process. Perfect for those who wants to keep track of their account, but don't spend more than a few minutes at a time on the site.",2
"I love this app, much faster than the regular Facebook, especially when logging in and out of different accounts, only problem is, they have font size options, small medium and large, the medium and large are not working. , the font size stays small.

"FB Lite is a stripped-down version of the Facebook app that is designed to be more lightweight and data-friendly. It's perfect for users who have limited storage space or slower internet connections.

Its smaller size and optimized performance make it suitable for regions with limited bandwidth. However, it sacrifices some features and visual elements found in the full version of Facebook.

"With Facebook Light you’ll be able to read through all your favorite feeds and stay up to date, all without the usual lagging during loading and annoying extras that can ruin your Facebook experience on older devices or slow network connections.

My experience with the face book lite is very good and exciting. It describes my all post in unique way which I never expected. Designs and backgrounds of posts appear unique. Photos uploaded looks very nice and clear. Home menus I find very transperent. It is not that the posts which I upload look different the post from others also avail the same benefits. In fact the engeneering attempt devoted behind this application is praiseworthy. there is a sincere effort behind making this application,2
"I recently tried out Facebook app, and I must say, it's fantastic! The interface is user-friendly, making it easy to navigate and use. I love how facebookapps.simplifies Facebook app . saving me time and hassle. Plus, the features are impressive and really enhance my experience. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, Facebook app. is a must-have. I highly recommend giving it a try!",2
"Looks well. I started using the lite app, because the original Facebook app is awful for Samsung fold. The home, groups and the other buttons started appearing on the left instead of the top... and when you scroll they start malfunctioning. Please fix the original app.",2
I think that facebook is a social media. We bring out our opinion with it. We see other opinion about any matter which is found in it. Besides we observe other subjects in our environment. I notice that Facebook has already increased it's kinds of function. Some functions give us money creating by them. I like this social media because it is very helpful to get more information about any objects from it.,2
app Facebook lite is so much lite application because it was almost 1.5mb app in download. Most better than Facebook. I love this app because I have low internal storage on my phone but I cant acess Facebook but now I’m using Facebook lite . And exciting features I had seen in the lite. Infact in slow network the facebook lite will run.,2
"January 2024 I rated this 5 stars because everytime I open Facebook lite it loads so long that I need to restart my phone and uninstall Facebook lite and aftar that it doesn't work again, I keep trying the method that I was doing but it still doesn't work. And one thing, everytime I watch reels some of the videos doesn't play the screen is just black. And I hope you fix this problem because I need this app and for other people too. 6,280 people found this review helpful",2
"Facebook Lite is an excellent alternative to the original facebook app especially for thoses.with limited data plans or slewer internet speeds .

"Love this lite version. Much less faf than the full version, plus it runs smoother and takes up far less room on my phone. Has a few less features, but to me it's worth sacrificing for the benefits the lite version brings, plus, you don't have to have a seperate messenger app installed, its all rolled in on this one.",2
"Whenever i try to open this App, for the first time of the day , it opens smoothly. If i clear all the Apps running from the RAM (Facebook Lite too) , and then open Facebook Lite again, it WON'T open ... It is stuck at 3/5 dots of the loading screen ..... VERY annoying .... Edit: The upper issue is fixed on some latest update. Time to give 5/5 stars now.",2
"These apps are good and fun because you can watch videos or reels here without having to go to other apps like youtube, etc. And you can text here with your acquaintances, you can use basic mode when you have no load. I rate it 5 stars even if it's a small thing it will help, so many people will be interested in these apps and install them.",2
"Easily connect to our Facebook app with a couple of button clicks. 2) Click the Retrieve Reviews button to download all your Facebook reviews and ratings in to your WordPress Database. 3) Create a review template and then past the template shortcode in Post, Page, or text widget. For Twitter: 1) Easily search for tweets mentioning your business or service. 2) Click the download icon next to the ones you want to save to your database. 3) Same as step 3 above.",2
"okay, I changed my rating, it's a good app, when compared to the full app, it might feel very basic due to lack of animations and all but this is a very robust app that does what it needs to do and my parents (they are the one who use facebook) have not faced any issues, so it maybe it's not as bad as I thought it was, geep it up devs👍🏾",2
"Great app. Everything is just one tap away. Just need to know if it was a setting or the update that doesn't allow comments to load in full, everytime I open a comment section, it tells me only important comments are available and when watching reels I can change it to view all comments. please how do I fix this Also every once and a while the closes down and takes me back to my home screen, which means I have to log in again thereby missing what evr6inwas reading or watching before",2
"Here's an example of a Facebook comment, I love this. You don't really to think that hard to come up with a comment. If you don't know what comment to leave, you can use the first thing that comes to your mind as long as it's a positive one . For example, if the first thing that comes to mind is , this is a nice outfit you can comment nice outfit. It is nice and beautiful. thare are picture and video post very easy. Facebook is very helpful.",2
"Early access apps are apps that haven’t been released yet. Beta apps are newer and more experimental versions of apps that are already released. Early access and beta apps may be less stable than most apps. For example, the app might crash or some features might not work properly.

Brilliant App a light version of Facebook. I'm very pleased . I don't like the Adverts. I wish there was a button I could switch them off as I'm not interested in them. Only the people I know on Facebook Lite. Other wise most pleased. 5 out of 5 👍,2
"thanks to this ""all in one"" application, here you can message just like messenger, scroll to see post just like on FACEBOOK also watch videos and see your notification, there's a new update that allows you to secure your messages, the pin thing but I'm not sure if I'm going to use that, i always forgot my pin codes🤣🤣🤣🤣",2
"Facebook, a useful, informative website, and social media platform for communicating to others and expressing yourself. To a lot of people, it seems like a good idea to join up to Facebook, but more often than not, they have not yet considered the vast negatives of using the site. Facebook has ownership of every single detail that the user gives to it. Every personal detail that is given by users, is saved and owned by Facebook, this is dangerous because of who the owner is, Mark Zuckerberg. Dep",2
Facebook like I didn't really enjoy that much it didn't seem to work good for me I'd rather just have the full program and use that one I did this at 4 out of 10. 💀RSD💀 I sure use leaning what they were doing when they wrote this program I know they weren't not.,2

You've made Facebook easier to manage and travel from point a thru z. Plus it takes less fill space on the memory of my phone and I don't have to have ads or messages I don't care to see. Thank you.,2
"The update has contributed a big change to the application specially when sending pictures you can now send multiple pictures, compare to the previous version you have to send the pictures one by one for which is not advisable if you want to send more than one picture so you need to switch to messenger just to send the pictures. 5 stars.",2
"Your app is worst than anything else why can't I view likes in my post and see more posts in my friends page in your Facebook lite app improve that and messages must be loading when I'm logging in and ut shouldn't be late and wasting our time and moments okay and it should be faster and quickly, effectively and reliable and dependable and messages should be always available and calling audio and video calls shoulall be available in Facebook lite and it shouldn't be consuming too much mb internet",2
"Great question! You actually CAN say ""you"" and ""your"" ... but the problem is that the targeting on FB is so robust that the policy is designed to protect users from feeling like Facebook/Advertisers KNOW about THEM. So when you say ""Do you create training videos ..."" And they actually DO create training videos, people feel like they are being targeted. A commonly successful work-around is to say something like ""IF you create training videos ..."" Questions with ""you"" can definitely be approved, b",2

The regular face book and messenger apps are not downloading. I'm getting a message that says there's a problem on are end try again. It's been 4 days and Google Play still hasn't fixed it. The same thing is happening with goodreads and the Barnes and noble nook app. So if it's a Google Play store problem can you please fix the issues thank you,2
Unfortunate Facebook has disable chats on mobile site. This works faster than Chrome and does not eat up battery life even on my BlackBerry Priv. Marketplace and messages are included which is what I mainly use it for.,2
"I've given Facebook Lite a 5-star rating for the exceptional experience, innovative features, and effective utilization of storage, data, and network speed. The integrated, hassle-free messenger has been very helpful for my personal and academic aspects. I highly recommend this app for the reason that it can be accessed without an internet connection, which is a good thing for me. I'm looking forward to the updated version and unique new features that I will surely love! #gratefultofacebooklite",2
I have no complaints right now I did have a problem a few weeks ago where for some reason every time I would share just one post from a friends page to another friend's page I would get a message that says you're blocked for 11 days that went on for like 35 or 40 days from just sharing one post from a friend to a friend I still don't understand what that was about because I see everybody else sharing hundreds of things with each other why am I being Chosen and picked on it,2

This app is helpful because you talk with people you don't even know where they live or where they are One thing I like about it you can even talk with people from overseas or either the place you need☺️☺️☺️,2
"I love this app because it works on slow network, saves mobile data since it uses low data and takes up little storage so it is good on low storage",2
"As if I open the app ,my friends will send me messages but I can't see it.Now I can't open the app since morning , I have updated this app more than three times but still it not working you should do well and update this app . Eiii I can't open this app ooooo 😂😂",2

"One way you might be able to improve your social media experience is to look at Facebook's Lite app (available for Android and iOS). Both the primary Facebook and Facebook Lite apps offer all the main features of Facebook, but the later version is designed to use less network data and will work well on low-end devices.",2

Facebook is very usefull in many ways . You can chat with people in online even though you never met before. This is also the place where many couples interacted and fall in love with someone . And it's good to stalk your love ones .,2
We all benefited a lot from using this app. Hopefully in the future it will be used in a more advanced and modern version. And We all want to a modern version of Facebook and messenger apps,2
It's so incredible. I also love the introduction of page profiles. Wooow thank you Mark Zuckerberg. Please add a feature that allows us to save reels,2
I love the app but now two days i can not access messsges from facebook lite messenger. Thank you developer because your app is suitable for phones with small storage. I need your help. Thank you,2

Facebook Lite is very fast and easy to use and Facebook has made our life easier. And I really liked how it made life so much easier to know everything.,2
i've been using this since 2016 till now and this app never dissapoint me although there are some error sometimes it was still good i really like the way you can still use it even though you don't have a load,2
What is the new version of bf lite you cant chat when don't have enough balace load in your phone it always says you cannot see message while you are in free mode try turn it to data mode to see it But it will take forever to prepare your chat list and it didn't work,2

"Good for the communication for fmily,friends and to my other relatives.and very easy to connect if u have a very important to know Bout anything else.and that's why I used this apps!no hassles if u have need to know about it!",2

"Easier to use and saves me battery life. I enjoy playing the games that Facebook Nametest game but it seems to have disappeared from the game line up.

This app helps me to talk to my friends any time and helps me to stay connected to my friends whenever I need to talk to them i really love this app,2
"The new pattern is properly not the way it was before, moreover making it look like am browsing through the computer of which you can't see things clearly just the way the main Facebook is.

So, What are you waiting for? Download this app now!",2
"Facebook is the number 1 Social Media Platform in the world. i hope facebook will support for messaging with another older phone who are using browser for facebook. he said want to messaging in browser for facebook.

The management of Facebook company was good before. Now it is changing day by day. Changing is great. But users also have preferences. That should be taken care of. We want pictures to be seen in basic mood on Facebook Because many times I can't see many important things of Messenger due to lack of MB. I am drawing attention to this matter.,2

"Used to be great, but now I would delete it. Only reason I keep the app is because it's my primary means of communication with a couple people. This gets a one star because of the repeat and incessant notifications. Not only when a friend posts a story, but 10 times for the same story after I swipe the notification away. Only notify once. I saw it. I swiped it. I did not want to interact. I do not need 10 notifications for the SAME post. This is, by far, the most obnoxious app I have.",0
Crashes constantly doesn't like Bluetooth. They added my ai which is very inconvenient when you're trying to send a quick message. They don't let you disable until you pay premium which I will never do specifically because of this feature. Scamming people to pay you isn't why the app started. There are so many adds on this app when I can just use a newer one that does the same features and no ads or forced premium to get the features of the app. Thanks for nothing snapchat you suck. 🙂,0
"There's a serious bug that needs to be fixed. Whether I'm on wifi or not, any video or pic that is sent to me says ""tap to load"" then I have to close the app out and open it again just to have the pic/video load. The tapping does nothing but open up the chat section of the person who sent it to me. Videos are constantly have to load after reopening the app & then it'll start the videos then close back out to the normal screen for the app. I've had to close and reopen the app 8 times",0
"Can we please change back or is there a settings to change the swip up feature on the camera screen to go to the ""Home, Camera roll, Dreams page"" and NOT that random oage that shows snaps from 2 years ago...😠 It's annoying it does that automatically. I know theres a lil tab at the bottom left for the memories page but the swip up feature (from the camera screen) was better!!!",0
"I am not getting notified when receiving a snap, and it isn't ringing when someone is trying to video call me. I have Notifications turned on, have tried every ""trouble shoot"" option that I found on Google. NOTHING has helped, VERY frustrating as I use video call with my grandson but miss calls because it's not ringing, and it doesn't work when I try to video call back!",0
"My AI is a terrible thing forced down your throats. No opt out, no option to unpin or hide. Oh and occasionally Snapchat will ""recommend"" a list of people to add. That would be okay if it wasn't for doing so in a pop-up with a prefilled ""add these suggested people"" and only a one button confirm. I may have had such happen recently when trying to visit a message line only to have a pop-up replace my click and send unwanted random friend requests that totally won't have any repercussions.",0
"For two weeks now, I haven't been able to reply to people in chat or with snaps. I've cleared the cache, updated the app, un-installed and reinstalled, and still nothing. I've tried reaching out to support and it's so user unfriendly. None of the support prompts are relevant to my issue, and there's no ""other"" option. It's getting to the point where I'm going to just delete the app if the bugs don't get fixed.",0
"Update 3/25: The support email listed ISNT MONITORED. I can't disable quick add, I don't know these people. Your app sucks worse than Internet Explorer I don't know what you did on the last update, but any text I add defaults to the bottom of the page where I can't access it because of the stupid filter pop-up. The whole point of this app was to the snap and send but you added too much and now it doesn't function well",0
"Honestly, there's just so much functionally wrong with this app, that at this point I have neither the energy or character limit to explain it all. This app is an absolute nightmare in every way. Edit: I have a new problem where the bitmoji stories won't show anyone in them other than the stupid ai you refuse to let us remove for free. I've never used the thing and literally just messaged someone before clicking on the story, but there the annoying ai was. I never see any of my actual friends.",0
"Editing my review bc of an ONGOING BUG that Snapchat has NOT FIXED. Every time I try to view a friend's story, it only plays the first 10 sec with sound, then mutes it. 😑 Also, whenever you try to share a memory, the date or how long ago it was is not on there anymore, so looks recent. Also, yet ANOTHER bug: whenever you try to post a video memory, it NEVER posts the clips in order. I have checked for updates, Uninstalled & reinstalled, & still not fixed. DEVS FIX THE ISSUE!! SC do BETTER",0
"My AI is just another instance of a company intentionally adding a useless, annoying feature that can only be removed by paying for a membership. I don't want it at the top of my feed, ahead of my real human friends that I actually want to talk to. Snapchat statted as an app for communicating with friends, it seems to have lost sight of that.",0
"I have many regrets updating today. I dont want the stupid ai as a ""friend"", i want to block it. Make on option to stop with quick add suggestions. The new look is horrible. I get more random people than channels in discover. And make a feature that actually filters stuff out when i say im not interested in it. And fix the bug of all my friends saying theyre new every time i open the app, they arent. Weve been friended for years, this is annoying.",0
I Updated to Snapchat plus to get the rewatch feature. I followed all the instructions you use it correctly and updated to the newest version. It has not worked. All screenshots of the feature online show a rewatch counter 👀0 at the bottom of the screen even if it's had zero rewatch it displayed at the bottom. Since I've updated and upgraded to Snapchat+ this has not worked an is a waste of money. The only thing that is new is the Snapchat+ screed that basically shows you a useless UI,0
"Upon reinstall, all my unread messages are not syncing. They show up on the web version, saying ""open in the app to view"", but shows up as opened in the app. Also, if you violate the tos you'll get device banned, so you can't even make a new account. Absolute garbage. Don't even get a second chance if you did nothing wrong",0
"I, probably like most people, have been using Snapchat for years now. Unfortunately, my immediate family still prefers Snapchat to send cute pictures of the pets and other silly casual photos. The app does great at this. The issue is the sheer amount of notifications. Constant notifications for people I am not friends with and notifications for people that I have blocked. Why would I want to watch their story? Why are you notifying me? Fix it.",0
"I do not want this AI bot above my actual family and friends. I do not want to use it. There is no option to get rid of it. No option to block it. No option to put it lower on the list. If I click to sort the list by ""best friends"" they are above the bot, but only until I leave the menu because if I do anything else it pops right back up. Also the promoted stories of people I do not follow or want to see now play automatically after my actual family and friends. Snapchat is destroying itself.",0
"There are way too many bugs in this app lately, it's no longer fun to use. You can't watch longer snaps or stories in their entirety cause every segment repeats itself until you tap to the next segment. Memories posted or shared no longer show the date of the memory, they show the date they're reposted. All of my favorited/saved videos completely disappear every couple of weeks and never reappear. Cant remove AI without paying. Disappointing snapchat ignores all tickets on these issues.",0
I don't know what's going on with this app I hate it. I've checked my texts constantly and the font of the text is so different from the standard bold dark looking font. My font is thin and some letters are spaced out when the word is only one word. What's going on it needs fixed I've compared it to my friends font on theirs and theirs is normal mines completely different YOU FIX ITTTTT!!!!!!,0
"This app is super buggy. Every time I add continuous video it either sends the cut clips in the wrong order, or duplicates the clip twice. Along side this I find the discover feed thing to be annoying, as well as the quick add feature. I feel like they're always trying to shove random people down my throat whenever I use the app. I just want you communicate with my friends. I wish there was an option to turn it off. The amount of times I almost sent personal stuff to random people is crazy.",0
"Absolutely despise the new updates but still good to text and call, that was a while ago. Now snap won't even open I've un installed it and re installed it. This is not okay at all. So many pictures chats everything gone. If I could give it a 0 I would. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Update: i tried one last time to see if I could get it to work and it did! For 3 days then it started freezing and kicking me out of the app so I uninstalled it and tried reinstalling it. It don't open and has a weird icon.",0
"Absolutely terrible experience on Android. I have been a long-time user of this app on Android and have been waiting for the experience to improve. For one singular app version, it supported my 3x and 10x zoom cameras. I updated it a couple of days later, and it was just gone. They have proven that they have the ability for good camera integration but refuse to roll it out promptly. The fact that I use one of the most popular Android phones and they still can't get it right is astonishing to me.",0
"One would think an edit would be to make this more positive, but no. Yes, the last weird/unintuitive update was reverted (movement of access to ""subscriptions""). Now access to camera roll has been changed. Every time I try to go to my photos it shows a random collection of Snaps that AI thinks I want to look back on. Much more likely to need my photos in a quick swipe. Memories was easy to access before! Make things like ""likes"" more accessible and organizable if updates are being demanded.",0
"Terrible last update. I've recently run into an issue where I won't receive messages/notifications if someone is typing, and I receive the message or notification minutes/hours later after they've been sent. It's not my connection either, I made sure to test that to see if that was the issue. Public stories are annoying, nobody asked for them. Quick add is pointless, given the fact that people can add you on a list that says 'People Not On Quick Ad'. Why let me turn it off if it doesnt even work",0
"I loved this app, but ever since the last update the filters don't work. Any filter that alters someone's face, I can take a picture but I can't take video anymore. The audio will come up normally and yet the video is like it's doing a slideshow, each frame holds for 5 seconds before switching to the next. Most of the app functions normally but filters that alter people's faces just will not work and it's driving me insane. They worked a couple weeks ago so what did you guys do????",0
"It's not a problem with my phone. I have already gone to the Verizon store and they can't figure it out. For some reason Snapchat notifications go off without a sound. Without a auditory notification system I miss out on a lot of snaps. Why is it so hard to create an app that actually notifies auditorally when you have a message. App is up to date, yet the problem has evolved to no visual notification either. I literally have to open snap chat every 5 min to check for a new message, trash!!!!",0
"I've been having a problem with this app for at least 4 months now. It's like the whole app is a glitch. Streaks disappearing and coming back, Filters not working, pictures are frozen on the screen until I close out the app, and it says I haven't snapped someone in 2 weeks but I snapped them 5 minutes ago. It's up to date. Very tempted to delete it.",0
"The screenshot shopping feature's introduction is extremely immoral. By just hitting the ""Great!"" (Which is basically the ok button) on a pop up, it automatically uploads ALL your screenshots without ever explicitly saying it's going to do so. The pop just describes the feature at a very high level without asking for this permission. I thought I was just dismissing the pop up. This needs to be changed ASAP",0
"No longer works, can't get help. Anytime I send a snap video to my friends over 10 seconds they cannot view it simultaneously. They have to go into our chat and open the videos one at a time. I've done everything clearing cache, data, uninstalling and reinstalling. Nothing is working and you can't ever get a hold of customer service, and there isn't any support in the support center for this issue.",0
Snapchat was a great app. But after so many updates it only seems to get worse. Is the AI feature and getting notifications when someone is typing really that necessary? It crashes every single time. Posting stories and texting has has became really frustrating. When I'm viewing a story it crashes and glitches by itself. Sometimes I don't even get notifications at all. And the 3d bitmojis look absolutely horrible. Video calling with friends has become really glitchy and the audio doesn't work.,0
"Too many changes in this new update. The ai thing is creepy and i don't like it and can't find a way to delete it. The constant ""quick add"" popping up is so annoying. The layout is also a bit different. I wouldn't have even updated the app if it hadn't been glitching a lot earlier. Now i seriously regret updating because it's so horrible. Snapchat WAS a simple, convenient way to talk to my friends but now it's all crazy and weird.",0
"No longer can you find random friends. Now, the only hope for finding friends in the search bar is giving the app access to your phone's contact list. Very invasive, very sketchy, obviously a data farm. 0/10 if you don't already have friends who use Snapchat you can't find any friends on Snapchat. Also they really are very demanding when it comes to your contact list. Snapchat REALLY wants access to your contacts.",0
"Great app, I've had it for years on many different devices, I've used it quite a lot over the years and not just for texting friends I also use it to take pictures of literally anything I think is pretty or cool or whatever, there is just one BIG PROBLEM... The bitmojis... They are hideous now and with each change to them they get worse and worse, no matter how hard u try it's always ugly they don't look good I would rather not have one at all! The original design was sooo much better plz fix it",0
"This app won't let me get past a pop-up window that comes up as soon as I open the app that states, ""We believe the camera should be optimized for each snapchatter that uses it. To do that Snap uses info about your face, hands, and voice to make certain features work learn more, and if you WANT to agree and continue tap below."" I don't want to agree to this. But it won't let me click out of it or use the app in any way. Uninstalling...very frustrating. This is ridiculous.",0
"Not worth downloading or even keeping anymore. This is the bottom of the barrel as far as social media apps. All the content is just ads. It's 10s of content and 30s of ads. Now the ""View Profile"" tab blocks a ton of the screen so you can't even see what's supposed to be there anymore. 90% of the content falsely advertises with the thumbnail. My review keeps getting worse because the app is worse and worse. This is the LAST thing you should download. Should have 0 stars.",0
"It sucks. It makes it super good for apple users (like dark mode) but for everyone else it kills the app. It keeps trying to push Snapchat plus, the fake tik tok and random stories of people you don't know. Sharing photos or videos from your library is a nightmare. The app is just full of garbage and poor choices. There's an ai that's stuck at the top of your conversation page and you have to PAY MONEY for a feature no one wanted. It also gives annoying notifications each time somepme types.",0
"The updates are making this app fade into obscurity and is absolutely full of bugs, instability, loss of useful and popular features, totally bizarre and unusable touch screen controls that are not synced with the actual place where you are supposed to touch. On my s22ultra I have to hover a 1/4 of an inch above the icon for it to possibly work, but some on screen items will never be able to utilized from the ridiculous discrepancy of syncingthevm layout to the touchscreen.",0
"Feels like it's run by a bunch of pervs bc you can't use the app unless you give them access to your phone so it can get your pictures from your storage. I get it that if I want to post pictures that you would need that, but I shouldn't have to allow a strange company access to my phone whenever they want to get my pictures if I am not posting pictures on the app. Extra side of CREEPY!",0
"Even with the latest phone and all the updates, the Snapchat experience on Android sucks. Text size and placement in videos often changes significantly from editing screen to final posted story or product. Director mode is unintuitive; easy to accidentally delete all clips with poorly named ""undo"" button when you'd think it would just undo the last clip or edit. Hardly use this app nowadays. Less time and money on AI nonsense, more investments on improving functionality please.",0
"Things were great! Having fun on the app, learning stuff. Then I found the Dreams. I tried the free pack, and it came out awesome. So awesome that I decided to pay for another pack. It never came. I wrote customer service. Their answer was, Hey, put a password on your stuff to avoid accidental purchases. They said they technically couldn't refund me as the purchase was thru the play store. I go to the play store. If I wanted the refund I could not access the app. BBBBYYYYYEEEE",0
"every update just makes the app worse and worse. every time I open the app it gives me an error box that says it's unable to open my camera and to restart my device. I've restarted it 3 times, it has permission to use my camera and gallery, I don't know what else to do. not a fan of the AI chat, I hate the quick add feature and seeing public stories from people that I don't care about.",0
Pretty much the only way I communicate. But recently when I send messages or snaps it won't even show the message as sending. Nothing shows up in the chat period. It tells the other person I'm typing but when I hit send there's absolutely nothing. My app is up to date. I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times and nothing changes.,0
Doesnt have a way to prevent drop down notifications. Very annoying when playing games or watching videos/movies. Notifications for Snapchat have been completely disabled as its the only way to stop the drop down notifications. Wish I could save videos I took and sent to someone. Was at a concert and took a video while texting a friend and sent it to them but after they opened it that one time it was lost forever,0
My audio stops working when I go to watch my friends videos they post. I may get through 1-2 snaps but then the 3rd one won't have sound.I don't know how many times I've gone back or gone out of the app completely to try again and same thing. I can't hear the entire videos being posted on stories. It hasn't always been like that.,0
"A relatively functional app that feels like it's pushing microtransactions as hard as possible. I am asked every time I open the app to join a group, advertised news media ""stories"", and now their exclusive AI is always at the top of my page, not my most recent message. The only way that I can find to remove these ""features"" is to pay $3.50 a month and unlock the buttons to say no thank you.",0
"This app used to be okay. I've began disliking it after frequently getting pop-ups for joining my school. I simply won't. More recently, in the stories section of the app, random people appear. I do not want to see random peoples' stories. There appears to be no way to disable it, which I find to be just stupid. Random people who I don't have added and don't have any idea who they are also appear after I take a snap and click send, once again, with no way to remove it. I'm probably going to quit",0
"Wish I could rate this lower. I have zero interest in the ai feature and it is impossible to unpin and clear the chat. The thing keeps showing up anytime I type ""my"" and it's ridiculous. The whole thing creeps me out and I cannot get rid of it, none of the online guides help due to what seems to be an error. In addition, every other time I open the app, my camera is bugged and appears sideways. No issues on any other app, just snapchat!",0
"this app keeps getting buggier. my snap chat has been occasionally closing without reason. the snap chat camera is completely non-functional. all I see are the buttons for taking pictures but none of the buttons even work. a lot of other occasional minor bugs every now and then like texts opening without you opening them and what not, but it's too much for an app like snap.",0
"The ads at the top of the screen have me constantly clicking the awful ai feature that I will never use, as well as the recent change of the bitmoji stickers from 2D to 3D is a horrifically misguided one. They lose any charm the 2D art possessed and instead look creepy and horrible. Never touching the stickers again since it cannot be toggled off. Also the lack of a BACK BUTTON from the stupid ai is infuriating. When I accidentally click on it I simply close the app for the day.",0
"This app has changed alot, its unfortunate how you cant dobmuch with the settings and its quite an invasive app. It shows your camera roll right on the screen without anyway to turn it off, and forces you to have access to your camera roll and your pervious photos you have taken even when you are not using your camera roll to send snaps. Be better.",0
"I like the app for messaging and sending videos/pictures back and forth to friends and I woulda given it 3 stars bc of some things that are wrong but I'm giving it 1 bc whenever certain ads pop up while watching stories it will automatically take me to chrome and wtv else. it is beyond annoying and aggravating when that happens and I hate going to my search history and just seeing a bunch of the same ad lining .y history, decent app that only seems to be getting worse.",0
"I use to enjoy using this app as a way to communicate with friends, but the addition of so many bottom-tier ads along with the really bad use of AI with ""My AI"" (which is pinned as your top conversation unless you *pay* to have it removed - imagine having to pay to remove a feature) makes this app pretty painful to use nowadays. Really just feels like a VC money grab. I'd highly recommend just sticking to texting, or maybe Whatsapp or Signal (which each have disappearing messages now).",0
"Recently reinstalled this app since I wanted a cheap collage done to help me visualize flower arrangements for a project and the sticker maker would do just fine for my purposes. After I made the simple collage, I wanted to export it to my email so that I could zoom in on the image because sc was not allowing me to. This is where I got a circle of death for 5 minutes before my account was locked for no apparent reason. And nothing is fixing it. Should've used Instagram or Microsoft paint.",0
"Instead of the previously annoying feature where the ""people to add"" pop up is in your way, there's now a pop up that auto checks the top 3 suggestions and the ""close"" button was replaced by ""add friend"" so I'm accidentally sending friend requests to people I dont want to be friends with. Please just stop, I know how to add people if I want to.",0
The last 6 months or so. Have not been able to update the app. Snap maps has dropped some of my friends. (They had a similar problem. But some have had theirs resolved.). So can no longer see them. They can see me. For the amount of upates it asks for. You would think this would have been fixed. Remove the public profile option. Or at least give the option to remove it or turn it off.,0
"I'm incredibly disappointed with the latest update for Snapchat. Ever since the update, the filters have been malfunctioning consistently. It's infuriating to spend time crafting the perfect snap only to have it ruined by glitchy filters. Despite numerous bug fixes, the problem persists, and it's beyond frustrating. I hope the developers address these issues soon because it's severely impacting my enjoyment of the app.",0
There are so many bugs in this app. Not even a single bug is fixed after updating it several times. Sometimes spotlight ends and can't be scroll and if I try to refresh and watch again it only shows black screen. Some filters are also glitching. Liked videos start from between and sometimes some part of it cut off magically. And many more glitches are there.,0
"I'm so pissed of lately. My snaps doesn't send after pressing the send button..I have uninstalled and reinstalled, updated and still nothing.. sometimes when texting the keyboard just disappears and I have ro wait hours!!when selecting sound, it doesn't play the just selected but plays the previously selected. Fix this ugghh!!!!edit..my font has been changed now and it's utterly disgusting",0
"Changed from 5 stars to 1. AI is not removable. Horrible garbage features keep getting added, more and more ads. Etc... crashes regularly on the newest model phones. Charging money for basic rediculous control over settings while simultaneously making the app worse. Update: worse crashing, freezes on camera, freezes after trying to send. New s23 ultra not the phone.",0
Filth are making it as hard as possible to delete my account. First of all hiding the functionality is slimey. Then having it go back to the main page when I tabbed for a second instead of saving where I was. Now it won't even bloody send me a verification email (got emails minuteS later) or text as it claims it did. App is some sort of clingy disease stay away from the likes of these.,0
"I would have deleted this app a long time ago if it wasn't the only way I can get in touch with a friend who lives on the other side of the country. The app doesn't like ANY of my devices (I even bought a new phone & it still doesn't like to load on it) and it takes forever to load the pictures/ videos people send me, which leads to them deleting before I can see it. I also hate the AI feature & can't get rid of it. AI is just creepy & doesn't need to be in everyone's lives all the time.",0
"Idk if anyone else is having these 2 issues. 1. when the app is in full mode and I start to type a message the message gets cut off after the first line. I can still type but I can't see what I'm typing. I have to go to ""pop up"" mode in order to be able to see what I'm typing. 2. semi recently I've been having trouble switching the camera from front camera to back camera in full app mode. Again I had to switch to ""pop up"" mode to switch and JUST recently I can't even change the camera at ALL",0
"Had this app for the last 6+ years and it's just got worse and worse!! Why are we now being forced to have a public account or BFF story on our profile (at least I have and I can't delete it like I used to be able to), to also have an AI chat (that we can't get rid of without premium), ads every 30 seconds when watching stories etc!! This went from being a really good simple app that I really enjoyed using, to talk too / video call friends etc, to now just plain money grabbing imo 😴✌🏻",0
Poorly optimized for most of the android devices. I use it on my One Plus 9 Pro and the camera quality of Snapchat is very poor. The app's video recording feature lags a lot because of which the video quality drops drastically. The company needs to expand its optimisation support to android devices as well and shouldn't just solely focus on the apple devices.,0
"This app lags every now and then bt since the last few days, it's been lagging way too much, and when I would send a text to my friends, it would take forever to go, and then today morning, suddenly, the chats completely stopped working and it still isn't working at all. Like when we click on chat, all I see is a white blank screen. All the other functions are working properly except for the chat and since the chat isn't working, I am unable to send snap too. please do something about it asap.",0
"Well if it were a little less devil stuff it would be better I'm a christain and I HATE it when I don't expect a Snapchat to have devil horns,etc. Snapchat should also be more obvious in their photos of what they are and it's almost not even worth it because it has been running to slow on my phone why even say it's compatable enough to download if it runs to slow to use. And there needs to be more genres listed for lense filters and they need to fit the description easier. Easier to find etc",0
"They prioritize a pay subscription with basic features that should be implemented free to use. This app could probably be one of the most innovative social media apps on the market if they really tried on focusing on the app and user interface as a whole rather than making money out of a basic subscription. They really went downhill with their latest updates and stopped carrying, which you can see with their glitches and bugs.",0
"This app runs terribly on android, even on top of the line models from Samsung such as mine. What's ironic is Samsung and Snapchat have supposedly collaborativly made this better for Samsung phones, and it still sucks. App constantly crashes, cameras fails to work in app often, and many features just don't work, like split camera modes etc. Oh and they just added dark mode only a few months back when IOS has had that for years, absolutely hilarious how much the company just seems to not care.",0
"I keep getting story notifications from the same individual. I've blocked it, reported it, said I don't want to see it & anything else that I can find on the screen. Yet I continue to get multiple daily notifications on them adding another post, that I still have zero interest in seeing let alone being constantly reminded about. How do I turn off these notifications?? I've been all over the ""HELP"" Snapchat pages and tabs with no luck getting help. Your email is no good too. 😠",0
"Everytime I open this app it pops up with ""add these people you may know"". I don't know majority of these people and because this comes up Everytime I open the app I've added way to many random people that I want nothing to do with. The menu is convoluted plus half the time swiping up to access my memory's will bring up a random one random memory and nothing else.",0
"I LOVED Snapchat up until the option ""multiple-snap"" was taken from the camera options. I'm hoping by complaining and writing my very first play store review, well have the option back. Also, the limited ""favorites"" filters being only on the bubble options and not the listed like before is a huge inconvenience because now to use my favorite ones without hastle, I would have to go unlike and then like it just so I can have it there on my home screen but it pushesOff other favorite filters ITSUCKS",0
"Please revert your February 14th update; it's not working. I can't video chat with my friend as it keeps crashing during video calls and glitches out on my friend's updated iPhone. This issue needs to be fixed as soon as possible, or I don't see the purpose of using your app. I don't want my phone to become damaged because you can't get your updates in order.",0
"The MyAI is really badly integrated. The app before was good. Also there is so much basic features that are payed (snapchat plus ) like for example changing the walpaper , or even deleting myai from your contact page. Also for sending videos , why are the long videos not supported. I use this app everyday and it definitely needs bug improvement",0
"It's really a pain in my opinion. The AI bot is super annoying. And all the filters are kinda boring in my person thoughts. I'm not sure if it's just for my phone, but I have tried deleting snapchat, but I'm not able to. Super annoying. And other than talk to friends, there's nothing to do on snapchat. So overall not recommend.",0
"I am very disappointed in my experience with Snapchat. I have always been informed of any updates or changes regarding my account, but for whatever reason this week was an exception. Snapchat no longer saves your account info and automatically logs you in after logging you out or having the app uninstall You need to have access to either your email or phone number associated with your account. Otherwise, you will lose years of memories. There was no heads up given ahead of time. What a waste.",0
"There are som many annoying ""features"" that we should be able to turn off. Let med remove My AI. Nobody wants to use it. The fact that it is pinned at the top is absolutely criminal. Stop automatically sending me to the discover section after i have clicked through all of the storys i am in. It is such a pathetically desperate way to artificially raise the number of views on those videos. Stop asking me to ""upgrade"" to snapchat+. There is nothing of value there, get real for christ sake.",0
"Subject: Reporting Bug: Incorrect Screenshot Notification Issue i am reaching out to bring attention to a recurring bug I have encountered while using the Snapchat application. Bug🪲: When closing a chat with any friend and suddenly re enter , the app erroneously displays a notification that a screenshot has been taken, even when no such action has occurred. This misleading notification is causing confusion and discomfort among friends which Can lead to break friendship.",0
The unread message notification has been saying that I have 1 unread message for months and I have no unread messages. I have searched no stop for a way to find some possible way to contact someone from this company and have run into a dead end every time I've tried to find an answer or any help. They don't seem to provide any way to contact them with a problem that they have no clue how to fix. :),0
"Title: Snapchat Zoom Control on Android: A User's Perspective As a Google 7 Pro user, I appreciate Snapchat's features. However, the zoom control disappoints. It's unresponsive, imprecise, and inconsistent. Improvements are needed to enhance the user experience and unleash creativity. Developers, please prioritize optimizing the zoom control for Android. Thank you.Android user, I've noticed that the zoom control on Snapchat is nowhere near as responsive or smooth as it is on iPhone devices.",0
"I was about to give a 5 stars on this app beacuse its very good and funs! But suddenly when i try to add some songs and trying to upload the snaps it was saying ""something went wrong please try again"" this irritates too much now! I don't know what happend with app but please as soon as possible you might have to fix this issue thank you! :(",0
There are plenty of things wrong with this app I got to be honest be I can put up all of them but the crashing this app literally crashes on you if you open another app (sometimes even when you close into the home menu) while on call or video call (it's worse when screensharimg) it crashes the UI to which shouldn't and that's the only thing I can't put up tbh,0
"Snapchat is absolute trash now. Turned off notifications, and over the last month its somehow slowly ramped itself back up to sending me a notification every hour that some person I've never heard of has made a post. The UI is atrocious, and the app is constantly bugging me with notifications I don't care about. Uninstalling after this review.",0
"This app is garbage now, the forced suggested friends, the forced stories, the click bait, the escorts that randomly add you even though you are hidden from quick add, not to mention all the ridiculous modifications you make to the app that no one wants, not to mention every time you try to leave a suggestion in the app it freezes so you can't submit it.. how about you tall all that stupid stuff no one wants and remove it?",0
"Newest update the loading of the filters is so so so bad that it seems it won't ever download it. Snap stories after showing ads the sound just stops. Why sending snap sometimes glitches and doesn't let you send it or at least save it. Fix this, it's annoying blud. On ios everything is just better. Removal of snap games is still an awful decision and paying to restore streak is greedy.",0
"Updated the app, stories are constantly on 30-50% loading, but never 100% loading. New update doesn't have delete option for said stories that are 30-50% loading. It's stuck in limbo, tried deleting cache and other options, nothing has worked. App in general won't load 100% and/or crashes. I should not have updated.",0
Update:* There are fake reviews to boost the rating on Snapchat. The texting is all messed up. My phone keeps crashing (pixel 7 pro) The calls are very bad. It cuts in and out every 2 seconds. This update is very bad which makes my experience with the app very disappointing. Needs to get fixed!,0
"❌️Absolutely hate the public profile!!! and the fact that there's no option to set which story you want to share to as default, the default is automatically set to the stupid public story. So I have to press and hold the ""add to story"" option just to select my friends only story EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Soooooo annoying!! 👎👎👎",0
"Lags a lot, it'll give the bitmoji the symbol that someone's typing even after the fact that they've already sent the message, sometimes snaps won't send or I won't be able to send snaps, sometimes I have to tap multiple times on something in order for it to work and then you guys also removed the multi snap feature",0
"i love being forced to watch memories anytime I want to look at my camera roll. like, no choice! you can't choose what memories pop up, IF they pop up, you have no choice. painful memory from years ago? bam, day ruined because snapchat decided it would be cute to remind me of one of the worst experiences in my life. without any say on my part.",0
"i'm unable to delete my accounts! I get this notification every time: ""We were unable to process your request. Please try again"" I googled and so many people seem to be having this issue, but no one has found a solution. It seems wrong that I can't get Snapchat to take my data out of their system. Don't trust them saying anything about a large user base when they are holding my account hostage ☠️☠️",0
"This app was great until I updated it. Now, I can't post more than 1 story a day coz anything after the first one says fail. Also, when I make a sound and save on my phone, the sound is always removed. The sound doesn't follow the video from snap",0
"I am not sure why. But these last few weeks, the app has been really slow when trying to use anything. Open snaps, taking videos, looking at memories. All take so much longer to respond to my commands. Very annoying",0
"Too many glitches. Can't swipe up and see memories. When memories finally appear, (after restarting app a few times) you send one and it does not appear in the chat. Too many issues.",0
"Get rid of the AI being the first chat option, I don't want more analytics built into the apps that don't need it, I don't want to have to give it access to stuff it has no business having access to just so I can delete the AI from my chat list. Nobody asked for this feature. Also the font changed? Harder to read messages now.",0
"okay. so I tried to hack my computer with the AirDroid app and then snap wouldn't open, it stays on the yellow screen, and it doesn't even say login or sign up. its so annoying. and I'm tired of this. and the web version is also a 1 star because you cant open snaps, cant save them in the chat, cant voice record, doesn't have the map, and you cant see your memories. PLEASE give a different version of snap for computers. also fix the web version. I hate having to admit that I'm on snap for web.",0
"I can't login to my account. The page says ""due to multiple login attempts, your login was blocked"". Like it's me! I'm giving the password, OTP everything! Just let me log in!!!! It's been a month. JUST LET ME LOG IN!!! Also, idk who is sitting behind the support team, but they suck! They create a never ending loop of ""possible fixes"" which don't fix the issue, and you're directed back to the main page again and again. Make real people support customers and not a damn dysfunctional website.",0
"It used to be a great app, but recently accidentally I lost my old id.now I'm trying to log in it but due to their security,I can't. They always show that there's no account on this email or phone.when I started using this, there used to be a system in which when you tried to log in and you forgot your password they would send a log in code direcrly on your phone they didn't asked you for it which was easy to log in your account.New update isn't great. Other people are facing this too",0
"Every time I open the app it crashes anything i have running in the background, shows my phone to hell, and i have to wait to be able to type anything because it lags out my keyboard. This is the only app that does this to my phone and i wish it would be fixed but it doesn't seem to be getting anywhere",0
"Freaking ai chat bot. Gets pinned to the top of your page with almost no way to get rid of it even though it is A, pointless, B, a product of theft and absurd amounts of energy usage, and c, NO ONE ASKED FOR IT. it's annoying, weird, and serves zero purpose. Hate it. It's honestly enough to make me stop using snapchat. I don't want to talk to a soulless, parroting bot. I have friends, and we are all switching to another service. If you're gonna add a horrible feature, at least make it optional.",0
"When we click on the camera, all of the sudden, a list of recommendations to add is shown and seriously it's very annoying. Other than that the no. Of ads in stories(either friends' or others') is way too much.",0
"So many bugs I don't even know where to start. The apps recently started doing this thing where if I swipe up to see my saved snaps, it automatically comes up with my recents from my camera roll, so I have to go back and even then, my memories don't show. I try searching for a month, it gives me a random month in a random year. For example, I just searched march (2023) it showed me October (2022) Update march 17th: still happening on several devices",0

There are a lot of bugs in this app,0
"After this new update, just haven't been receiving any notifications from snapchat. I went into my phone settings, as well as the app settings. My notifications are on for all of it. Before I did the update, the app was glitching when I was trying to take pictures to send to chats. However, worked fine when I was taking pictures in general and then choosing who to send them to. Idk if that is fixed yet or not. I've been stuck on trying to figure out my notifications issue.",0
"I love to use this app, however on my Pixel 8 Pro I have had many issues much more than previous years. Typically when I open the app it'll be normal, sometimes it'll distort and turn the camera sideways even after factory reset. Sometimes it refuses to even use the camera, I have to close the app, sometimes that doesn't even work, I'll have to clear the cache. Not too mention spotlight, or any of the other annoying public ads, they don't have a themed application for pixel UI, it won't take ""no",0
"I love this app and hadn't had Any issues with it until Now! Idk if it's a new update or what, but all of a sudden I would try to click on it and it'll act like it's trying to load, then it just minimizes back down and throws me off it. So I thought maybe I need to uninstall and reinstall it. Then I thought it could also be my memory. So I'm just subscribed to Google One for 100GB more of Data, not including my 32GB memory card I have in my phone, and it's not letting me Reinstall it anymore!",0
"Good when it works, but for some reason, when I go to look at my photos, it puts me into an album, and the buttons won't show up. Having photos I don't want on my screen and inhibiting me from looking at my photos, making it extremely annoying. If I want to look at the albums, I'll click on them myself. Please remove them being shoved in my face",0
"Few things need to be fixed. 1. When posting memories, now it says the time you posted it (ex: 3 minutes ago) instead of ""2 years ago"". Just mad annoying. 2. Saving chat videos splits a 50 second video into (5) 10 second videos. Just save it as one video 3. If I accidentally have the ""loop"" option picked, it will loop the 10 seconds over and over and not play the full clip unless someone taps the screen. Makes no sense. No one wants the same 10 seconds repeating in a 34 second snap 🤷🏽‍♀️",0
"This app's core functions (sending and receiving snaps, posting stories) are actually great and pioneered something for sure, which is the reason this isn't getting one star. Everything else that's been added over the past few years is garbage, and continues to worsen. I don't want an AI stuck to the top of my chat feed. I don't want to see stories from people I don't know. I don't care that my streak died. And the Discover section is filled with the most brainless trash content I've ever seen.",0
"If downloading on app , don't download it you will end up staring at a yellow screen with the logo on it. On the web is okay but you can't open snaps/videos or like/comment on spotlight. Also if you send a snap via snapchat for the web, the reciever will get a link below your snap of snapchat for the web which I find annoying. On a phone, this app is good but I recommend a page where you can see who you recently unadded, a dark mode for your friend page, and friends to add within your area.",0
"Many issues and questionable choices with UI (showing you stories you aren't subscribed to, memories are bugged because they show immediately as you swipe up, they no longer register if you've watched it or not, random stories pop up prompting you to follow them, etc.) Overall very cluttered and almost like an attempt to show you whatever they can to keep you on the app.",0
"One minute I can send snaps, text, voice messages, etc, then randomly for like 5 hours it won't send anything at all. Yes yes yes I've tried Uninstalling, clearing the cache, Uninstalled the update and re updating it. Nothing helps and it's fine when I zoom in but when I zoom out it lags pretty bad. I literally uninstalled it, 7 hours later re-download it, replied to 3 friends and it was fine. Tried to reply to another friend.... nothing.... I've had it with this app. I'm going back to messenger",0
"I don't know thought it would be a good idea to make random photos come up when you swipe up for your memories but it's awful, and hard to just back out so you can see your memories in month order like how they have always been. Why do you insist on changing things for no reason, when they are good as is? You're not increasing shareholder value, no one is downloading snap more because they added some kooky feature. Just stop with all the constant dumb updates",0
"I find it a pretty useful way of communicating with people you know. However, one thing that i find annoying is the app's tendency to unexpectedly reopen a previous snap that you've taken shortly after closing the app, which sometimes causes me to make unintentional actions such as uploading it to my story.",0
"This app not long ago started working perfectly well and I'm very happy that I don't have to deal with several problems anymore! But of course something bad has to happen. Please. PLEASE. Make an option to turn off 3D bitmojis. Trust me, they're hideous and ugly. Snapchat isn't the same anymore without 2D bitmojis, and they've been so iconic for years. Please make an option to turn the 3D bitmojis off. The stickers look TERRIBLE.",0
"Add in the option to turn off the ""quick add"" section. Put in the option to turn off the public profile. Add the option to remove the AI because that does absolutely nothing for me. When you add a story with more than one person, I don't need a group chat with both of them. I already talk to them both and that's all I need. Remove that from the story settings and put it back to showing up in the individual chats. It won't let me add a new chat shortcut no matter how many times I try.",0
"Pros: custom character creation and when the app does work, it can make chatting with friends fairly easy. I also like the different filters. Cons: the app crashes while searching for a filter to use. It recommends ""people I may know"" who I, in fact, don't know at all. And last but not least, these GOD DAMN ADS! I just want to watch natural disasters and such without seeing an ad every 3 seconds!! Whoever said ""you can never have too much of one thing"" is a liar, there's way too many ads!!!!!!",0
"Good app for communicating with friends, but dragged down by braindead ""features."" No, I don't want to see random people's public profiles, if I did, I would look for it. No, I don't want to see quick add all the time, evidenced by the fact that I turn contact synching off every day, and don't allow myself to show up in quick-add. Not to mention the decreased camera quality or weird camera glitches that I've been experiencing lately where it stretches the image in weird ways. This app is a mess.",0
"Love this app, it continues to improve often. The only thing that makes me absolutely crazy is if you are watching their extra clips, the 25 ads in between a 2 min video is kind of ridiculous.... I get ads, theyre necessary. But maybe *before and *after the clips would be wiser. It's not like we aren't going to watch them... It's prob the most irritating thing. Def would be 5 stars if they can get their ad quantity under control AND not interrupt clips every few seconds.",0
"Just cross-graded to a Samsung device. Permission monitor is noticing consistent & significant background usage of camera & microphone, specifically while I am not using the app, and even when it is closed. App permissions show that it may open in the background at phone startup, run in the background at all times, use the camera & microphone while in the background, &c. Creepy. Two stars because it is a good app, though very slow these days. Must be bottlenecking on all the surveillance.",0
"What Happened to Sending Videos?! For about a year now, I've been unable to send full videos even if they're under a minute long. No alert or anything, it just sends 10 seconds of the video and then cuts off. I remember when sending long videos through snapchat wasn't an issue and now I can't even send 25 second ones. The AI assistant is sketchy and not ever helpful. Keep the app simple. It's bogged down with spotlight and random stories of people I don't know.",0
"Please for the love of God fix the notification bug! It's been over a year and I STILL can't get notifications from people trying to message me. I may as well unfriend them so they don't think I'm ignoring them when it's been two weeks before I even notice it's there.. I have tried EVERYTHING from reinstalling, clearing the cache, turning off do not disturb, making sure notifications are on and at max volume. Nothing. It's utterly impossible to stay in touch with anyone on this platform.",0
"I enjoy sending pictures, chats, and stories with friends, but all the updates continue to suck. As of today, the creepy AI character can no longer be hidden from my chats and is the top ""person"" listed. I wish I could delete the character from my friends list completely. The public stories being suggested are annoying and not something I want to watch. Picking a filter is always an issue because as I scroll through them, it disappears or stops on a random one and won't let me change it.",0
"I have been using snapchat for years. And now, on occasion, when I open the app, the screen shows me as if I have my phone turned horizontal when I am holding it vertically. And as of recently, the screen distorts and stretches my face. Both of these only go away when I take a photo. When I take the photo, it appears normally, but if I go back to try to take another picture, it changes my face again. And, the issue does not go away when I close out and reopen the app.",0
Changing fro 4 to 2 because I keep having issues with the camera. I've sent in a complaint to Snapchat via the app a while ago and still does it. The camera zooms in before I take the picture but once I snap the picture it turns out fine. It's just annoying to try to work around it. If I restart my phone it works fine for a while but I should not have to constantly restart my phone to get the app to work properly. Please fix!,0
"Hi there, when I first got this app, Snapchat has been great! Easy to use and so on, but lately, I've been experiencing some glitches and buggy things happening, I have tried to restart my phone, reopening the app, and other ways! It won't let me send, see, or connect with my friends, my wifi and internet connection have been perfectly fine, I tried other apps as well and I found no issues, but when going to Snapchat, there is an issue with communicating, please help me/others fix this problem!",0
"It's okay but for the life of me, I cannot figure out why my app isn't sending notifications anymore. All notifications and settings are set to send them but I am missing messages because it's not sending notifications that someone had sent me anything. My video call feed keeps freezing like 2 seconds after I turn on my camera too...Needs to be fixed but other than that, it's a good app.",0
"Glitches too much. When I try to post a video that's more than 10 seconds long, it mixes the order of the video and it doesn't upload in order. Example: for a 40 second video, it splits it into 4 separate 10 second videos, but then it uploads the last 10 deconds first, then the 3rd 10 seconds, then the 1st 10 seconds, then the 2nd 10 seconds. A mess.",0
"This program has been flawed for a long time, not only the notifications never properly show up half the time, but the amount of advertisements is insane. I'm still on version 12.05 for a while now, but I think those ridiculous nonsensical features are both based from their server and the app itself. I can see public profiles that I never knew or asked for next to my subscriptions I know of. I can no longer post to ""my story friends only"" at all. I can remove myai, that's the only pro I can add",0
"I've had audio issues with the app for nearly a year now. My memories often times no longer have audio, and videos that are sent to me (saved videos by others) hardly ever have audio. I used to really like this app but it's gotten significantly worse over time. Assistance is also virtually non-existent. There are several threads on Reddit of similar bugs going back 3 years that have never been fixed",0
"Good to stay in touch with friends. Everything else, though, is garbage. Engages in malicious UI by forcing ""my AI"" to the top of your friends list, and constantly asks to get installed on your computer. It shifts your friends list so you click these intrusive things. The ONLY way to disable this is to pay them a subscription fee.",0
"It used to be a go-to app for me to text friends really quickly but now its just frustrating. The constant updates made it really glitchy on my phone. When I'm typing a caption on a photo, it disappears right as I tap away from the keyboard so I have to retype the whole caption or send an entirely different photo if I accidentally press send too quick. The AI feature is useless to me but there's no option to delete the bot from my chats. The bitmojis are also extremely unpleasant to look at now.",0
Updates keep getting worse. More glitches. The camera gets stuck stretched out making me close the app and reopening it to fix it. Issues with the custom stories saving who is blocked from seeing my stores so I have to go through my friends list constantly. The music audio doesn't go in sync with videos when i edit what part of the song I choose. Stop adding new features no one asked for its bugging out the app and the bitmojis aren't even fun to use anymore they all just look scary.,0
"Was decent not that long ago, but latest updates have introduced many app-breaking bugs. Camera is rotated 90° and squished, messages usually don't load or are delayed, and filters straight up do not work when taking a video. The app is also very invasive of your privacy. much like most other social media apps, I see oddly specific ads based on my private conversations and even based on things that have been seen by the camera while the app is open, even if I didn't take a picture. Very creepy",0
"It used to be one of my most used social media apps but for about a month, it's been super buggy. The current issues are unbearable.. I can't send snaps or chats. Every time I create a message (snap or chat) it simply disappears after I press ""send"". And it's always a mystery to me whether my friends will get it or not because to me it looks like the messages never even existed. THE APP IS SIMPLY USELESS IN REGARDS TO COMMUNICATION.",0
"The app feels better in some ways, but still has many flaws, especially compared to it's IOS counterpart. We finally got dark mode which is nice though. Many bugs, freezes, and general unusability still flood the app, many of which the higher ups just don't seem interesting in fixing. By far the worst part is basic features being hidden behind pay walls, such as DISABLING AN AI CHATBOT? Or pinning messages, both unnecessary to restrict. Highly unrecommended, just don't bother getting it.",0
"This app is completely psychotic. It literally WILL NOT STOP sending you notifications. You can clear a notification only to have the same exact message will pop back up literally seconds after you got rid of it. The developers of this app are sick in the head and I pity them. Also, your suggestions are complete and utter garbage. Why do you even try? Just stop.",0
"Inconvenient updates. Unnecessary changes that mean you can't always see content you follow. Way too many ads. Certainly not worth paying for. Content often freezes or gets stuck loading. Pics/videos sent from friends or family, you occasionally have to completely close out the app for them to pop up, or they never load. Developers keep removing helpful features and don't putting them back until after nearly a month, and they come back worse than before. Paid version not even worth free trial",0
"Great for keeping in touch with my sister, who lives out of state. But it's a data hog. The recent bitmoji update is really bad. Their arms are so long! I had mine dialed in to look exactly like me, and now it looks nothing like me at all! I'm sad about it. I miss the old ones tbh. Also, the AI needs a hide option. I'd very much like to delete it from my conversation page.",0
"This app has some flaws, One flaw is that the call button is way too close to the exit button to stop chatting with someone. Second flaw you get an annoying random friend recommendation. A flaw that's only happening to me, I think, is that I can't install it anymore. I try to do all the things it shows me, like updating the system, clearing storage, and restarting my phone.",0
"The app is okay for messaging, which you can always just text people. But the stories suck. You see a video that looks interesting and you have to skip through 30 mini videos, in that video, to see what you were looking for on the front of the video you clicked, sometimes it's not even part of the strip either. It's an Absolute garbage aspect of the app.",0
"For the last few months, it is giving me problems with viewing my pictures. Super laggy and slow. And it no longer gives me the option to delete or edit my photos. No option menu at all. My internet connection is just fine, so it's not that. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but the app is still not letting me edit or delete photos anymore. No option menu is coming up on photos and it's taking super long just to be able to view a photo.",0
"I also have been experiencing issues,but my issues started LONG before the last SEVERAL updates. I.e when I start putting gifs,stickers etc on my pictures, if I try to put more than 3 it crashes. Everytime. Also half the filters NEVER load they stay greyed out. Not because of my connection either. This has been an issue for a year or more now.😒😤🤦🏽‍♀️👎🏼",0
"I had the app since it first came out. I loved it. However due to all the changes ex. The map, ai, and the new public stories I no longer use snap. I missed having more privacy on it. Not everyone wants to be an influencer.... I wished they would go back to the old snap chat. Also the notifications are ridiculous now, it will notify me of memories but not when I have messages, also my steak suddenly disappeared. It's just not what it was and that's sad.",0
It's great to chat with friends and it has some really great features. I've been using it for years. I'm just sick of seeing the stupid snapchat AI. Let me remove it without paying for snapchat+. A subscription should unlock enhanced features of an app not an apps basic functions. If I can unfriend and even block teamsnapchat I should be able to do the same with snapchat AI.,0
"This app is really good. I've had this app for about 3 and a half years and it's really good for chatting and has perfect safety settings. I also really love the photo filters but recently when I recieve snaps, it just won't load, I have some snaps that haven't loaded for two months. I tried deleting and reinstalling the app but it didn't help and also there are ads everywhere. And when I post stories with the 24 hour settings, it randomly deletes automatically within 1-3 hours, it's very bad.",0
"The app is objectively good. The features are great and I use it daily, but there are so many bugs that seriously need fixing. 1) text deletes itself on snaps and you have to retype it 2) sometimes the camera won't record when you want to record and it'll say recording failed 3) when it does record there's always a second or so delay (same with a snap) so the first part of the video is cut off 4) snaps won't load at all. I have a snap a friend sent that's been loading for OVER A MONTH",0
"App works well for communication. Not convinced of the security. Although I have always had permissions for contacts and call logs turned off, the constant and annoying suggestions of people I may want to connect with always mysteriously and miraculously finds my friends, or my friends son, who I just happened to add for an emergency contact only days before. Regardless, whether they across the country so its nothing to do with proximity. They are being deceitful with their permissions!",0
"Despite the user friendliness of the app, the way the new update made accessing your camera roll (if you want to be posting previously taken 📸 from your camera, or even a downloaded image) is just downright terrible. No longer can you simply scroll up and see it - instead you get greeted by a randomly saved snap of yours. Was that even QA tested? I get that it's now a button we can tap on the bottom left, but would be worth making that a bit more noticeable.",0
"Add in the option to turn off the ""quick add"" section. Put in the option to turn off the public profile. Add the option to remove the Al because that does absolutely nothing for me. When you add a story with more than one person, I don't need a group chat with both of them. I already talk to them both and that's all I need. Remove that from the story settings and put it back to showing up in the individual chats. It won't let me add a new chat shortcut no matter how many times I try.",0
"It was very good in the beginning but from the past few days I am facing many problems. when I tried to send snaps to my friend with full internet, it shows the option failed. Then I deleted the app and reinstalled it and tried to log in, it is not workingneither switch accounts nor sign up. Also before deleting the app when I tried to download the old photos, it was showing the option of failed again and I was not able to download the photos.",0
"Umm....This app actually very cool.But l've been facing some issues since morning today ,I was uploading a story and sending snaps to some of my friends even after an hour so ,it still wasn't sent ,I checked my internet and all the other apps were working just fine ,I also tried going on to the web version on to which I had logged in on my cb nd again it wasn't loading,I checked other websites, which worked just fine,I would be extremely grateful if you would fix the bug . Thankyou.",0
"I despise that the AI thing is just there at the top of my list of interactions. I do not and have never talked to it. I don't want it there. I should be allowed to opt out. Having it above my actual friends makes it feel like this non-person is somehow more important than actual people. The stuff in the discover section is just pure junk, some of it complete pseudoscience. This app is overall mid",0
"I use Snapchat to see stories from my friends, but now get all sorts of random people showing up in Friends stories. I've never heard of these people, they're not even contacts. I don't want to see their stories! AND, for some reason, every one of these suggested stories is a male. Pretty creepy. I have turned off every option I can to not be in quick add, not sync contacts, not be public, any hint I find about this, and they still show up. I have blocked so many accounts! More show up later.",0
"The snapchat camera is not very good. And it takes much wi-fi to use this app. Also, the less variety in bitmoji's feature and clothing makes it less fun. Moreover, the Ai is not as helpful because it gives you wrong information if it doesn't know about something and also make false claims. I wish you teach it to say 'I don't know' or 'It's not possible for me'.",0
"A lot of people use this app, but the updates have been causing so many more problems than they fix. AI on this app is a stain that serves no practical purpose and is only there to farm money from a subscription service that is virtually worthless. Paying for anything on this app is a waste. AI should be removable for free. Recently, stories have been added and appear automatically every time you want to look at the gallery? what the hell is up with that.",0
"I hate, hate, hate, the fact that snapchat pushes its stupid premium stuff. Give everyone the option to turn off the AI at the top... its really weird that it can look at your story too. What function does that have and why is It even a thing. This is so very frustrating that you force things down our throats after having this content perfect for years.... you are about to lose a customer... and many more.",0
"I keep getting push notifications for new story about from SuzannaZ, And it's the same story every time and I hate it. I blocked her but that didn't stop the notifications. I have stories on only for friends but this kept showing up in my feed. I turned off stories completely today and updated the app. If this doesn't fix the issue I'll be disappointed",0
"Not here to talk about the rest of the app: particularly the bitmojis. It's like they just HAVE to make them uglier every few updates. This latest one, however, will create an absolute FIRESTORM once everyone gets the update. Not everyone's 7 feet tall, snapchat, and our heads aren't that small either. Quit trying to make the bitmojis more realistic, because you're going the opposite way and it's terrifying. On the other hand, the app helped me re-kindle some old friendships. Credit to it there",0
"Friend suggestions are annoying af, sometimes they even force you to look at them through push notifications. Also there's a bug that I can't report because I don't have the option to. This bug causes my messages to not be sent and I have to reinstall the app every time only for this to happen again every 2-3 days. Please fix this.",0
"Figure it out, honestly. W ads between 80% of stories I watch, prompts to add snapchat to my homescreen, the same general ""discover"" no matter how many times i ""hide"" the same general content, and several other annoyances... figure it out or I feel I will not be the only user to get tired of this and be done w snapchat all together.",0
"I haven't being using the app lately so It was outdated. Then I updated it only for the lens and filters to be showing like a pink-and-black-tiles. I don't know what's wrong with it. So I decide to uninstall it then reinstall,but it's still showing same stuff (pink and black tiles) I wish I could screenshot it as evidence. I really do love the app but I don't think that's gonna be anymore",0
"Buggy discover page, unable to disable features seemingly based on algorithmic suggestions, unable to block certain creators who's content still appears after hiding, reporting, force stop and cache clear. Edit - Phone restart, uninstall reinstall, confirmed everything is updated, sent big report... still not working. Edit - bumped to two stars because *some* bug fixing has been done. Now stuck at ""Snapchat was unable to open the camera......"" pop up, only a full phone restart resolves that. :(",0
"This app has really gone downhill in recent years. It's an okay chat app, but the way that (usually sexual, though not enough to warrant actually being blocked) public content is pushed can only be described as cancerous. The constant notifications are obnoxious as well - why would you want to be notified that someone is typing? Seems to me that this app is probably one of the bigger problems when it comes to perpetuating phone and social media addiction.",0
"After update 11.2.0.68, the app just makes my screen blackout randomly. I have to lock my phone and unlock it again to restore it. It's a bug and I hope the devs fix it soon. Also, the SnapMap UI is a bit laggy, so please fix that as well. Overall, the app is great.",0
"I used to love this app but I'm growing more and more sick of it lately, mostly due to completely fixable problems. My #1 complaint is notifications. I don't ever want to get another notification for someone typing, or someone in a group chat reacting to something. Give me more nuanced control of notifications and I'll change my rating upwards, otherwise I'll turn them off and almost certainly uninstall the app after that.",0
"The UI ineeds to be thrown out and though reinvisioneed. Also, most people on my friends and following lists are people that I never friended or followed. I am certain Snapchat uses an AI to force my account to follow people and become friends with people's accounts without my knowledge or permission, but hey, anything to keep up that user engagement, right? Including massive breaches in trust.",0
This app is so good. But recently the ai feature is so different that old one is better than this and why if I opened some one's profile who I have not added as friend they comes in front of me like they are forcing me to add them . And can snapchat add search bar for spotlight videos. I want to watch some videos that I have watched before.,0
"Very nice app, filters are really good my pictures are clicked very clean but way this was want update every second day!! I don't have that much network to spoil on it, so there must be Beta change this type of issues please, and also i can't see the older pictures with out network way that is happen",0
"Way too many ads. It is very irritating watching the same ad again and again. Also the amount ads I get is a lot making me want to close the app instead of using it. Also features such as comment likes are taken away randomly and the app is buggy, screen turns black and what not. Horrible experience.",0
"All of a sudden, I get notifications that there's a new snapchat story. I check it, and it's a story by someone who isn't even on my friend list. I don't care about seeing stories by people I don't even know. Also, the map doesn't show where all the hot spots are anymore. I hate this version!",0
"Keep getting ads for the new subscription. Keep getting notifications for stories i havent subscribed to. Quick add to add more friends takes up half my screen, just showing random people i dont want to add. Have a notification to open my profile every time i open the app saying to veiw my (non existant) public profile. Get random notifications for non existant friends messages. Etc",0
"Annoying lately. Since the last update, every time I try to record something, it it freezes after the second or 3rd attempt. have to close out the whole app and re open it. Ruining the moment altogether. . Sometimes opening the camera is too much for the thing. I also have a relatively new Samsung galaxy.",0
"Notifications out of control! I am getting notifications from people I don't follow, and I have that feature turned off. When I clear them, they come back, several times a day. I want to see my friends content, but I may have to uninstall if this continues.",0
"Everytime I open the app my camera is flipped. I don't even understand how this issue happens but I can't send pics bc my camera is either stretched or rotated for no reason. I have to exit and relaunch the app to reply to snaps. This issue is so dumb, annoying, and confusing. How does it even happen? Fix your app please.",0
"It was working fine, but they rolled out that AI feature and won't get rid of it. Seriously considering swapping to another platform at this point. Edit: new update says that i have unread messages but it shows no unread messages Basically every update gets worse",0
"Today's update made it where the creator's name, the view profile, and basically all of the stuff is super imposed DIRECTLY on the video at the bottom... Where subtitles tend to be... Blocking them from view... as well as 1/5th to 1/3rd of the video being blocked... If you're not going to let us customize HOW the thing is laid out, at least don't super impose icons and banners across the videos... The only reason it's 2 stars is because of themes FINALLY being added.",0
"So tired of the useless updates!!! I've used Snapchat ever since it's been a thing. If I try to swipe up to look at my camera roll/memories, it just loads my ""year ago today"" memories and its the only thing i can view. I will restart my phone and force stop the app but if I want to send something to my story or somebody I have to go through a chat and re select who i want to send it to. Maybe Snapchat wouldn't need so many updates/bug fixes if y'all didn't cram so much stuff into the app.",0
"Saw a new feature for adding my high school, but it's only for 2023 to I think it 2028. I'd like to see older years on there, because I'd think it would be pretty cool to be rocking my hometown team colors regardless of me having had already graduated years ago. I'm sure others would probably agree (especially for supporting those local home games), but I can't speak for all. - '12 Allumni WHS",0
"Snapchat needs to get themselves fixed. It is impossible to fully watch any of the reels. You start to watch one, and then ad's start playing on a loop. I don't mean the occasional ad like normal. I mean, the ad finishes and then instantly another ad starts.",0
"The font is messed up. Why is it all wacky and different?? The spacing is messed up, the letters don't match, it's a wreck. Also, the amount of ads is just ridiculous. Two or three every couple of clicks.",0
Like this app but it has so many unresolved issues! This is frustrating how it hangs and then can't be backed easily or get filters😮‍💨🥲....adding another problem...i can't find all friends i added in shortcuts as well as in normal chat😭 like what on earth is wrong with snapchat???,0
"Camera zoom doesn't work like normal. It either zooms way in or out, no in between. Takes forever to send a svreenshot or picture chat. No longer shows what someone is replying to, which makes it very difficult to remember what you said. Every update gets worse and worse. And I stand by my question what in the actual eff is an AI bot and why is it necessary? Just to make people pay for snap plus?? Nope. It's stupid. The whole app is getting stupid.",0
"I'm a Samsung S21+ user and since the second last update i encountered a problem with Snapchat using my 5G/4G for (Chats, Snaps, Storys, Memories, e.t.c) Nothing works everything loads for hours but never finishes, at the moment i Connect to a Wifi everything appears directly loaded. I already tried uninstalling and reinstalled. In the first minutes, everything works fine and loads directly with 5G/4G, but after opening and closing several times, this problem comes back. I can only use on Wifi🫤",0
There is one option misisng for deleting multiple snap at once. You should add clear chat permanently option or select multiple snap and delete at once permanent option instead of selecting one by one. It occupy the storage of the phone and also junk data is left all over. Request you in the next release try to add this option which will save the storage and avoid junk data leftover problems in your cloud,0
"Good for conversations with friends but if I get another discover notification I'm going to hurl my phone through a window. I don't know how many times I've tried to turn those stupid notifications off, but every single time without fail I get another discover notification. Please. Let me have peace.",0
"Doing anything on this app is frustrating and takes AGES. That's in addition to an AI chatbot you can't remove or opt out of. And the best part - bitmojis - have been twisted into hideous, uncanny monsters. I'm uninstalling... As soon as the app starts responding again.",0
"The Quick Add feature is one of worst parts of Snapchat. No idea who most of these people are and somehow they end up added as friends even without being accepted. It's to the point where their stories flood my feed. If I wanted to add anyone, I'd ask them directly. 🧐",0
"I don't understand the app again...I just updated the app 2 days ago, and some of my favourite filters have not been fix it. I use the app alot please. More like, nothing has been done since I sent my reviews. Some of the filters are not working at all on my phone. Thanks",0
"Not sure if it's the new update or what. All my messages give a ""failed to send"" message at the top of my screen and dissappear. Every snap, every text. Only on the mobile app. Not the computer version.",0
"I wouldn't use it if it wasn't for other family using for messaging. My camera is like many others have commented... upside down in calls, landscape when phone is oriented portrait etc googled issue a couple of times but not found a permanent resolution yet.",0
"lot of minor bugs. for example, swiping for filters after capturing gets too laggy and bugs when I apply one filter on the other (hold and swipe). also, since some days I'm seeing transparent ghost wireframes overlays of the spotlight interface while editing the snap.",0
"The app use a lot of my data just by watching snaps that I don't even want to watch, because there is no option to by pass snaps, for example if I'm interested in one snap on a profile I'm forced to watch all the snaps of that profile until I'm on the right snap, there should be a next button in each snap without downloading those snaps so I can go and watvh just the snap that I'm interested to watch, also there should be an option to choose the quality of the snaps to reduce the data.",0
I'm rating it a 2 because all of my mobile data rena out so I couldn't do ought about it and I had no network at home either it wasn't working. And I was sending snaps to higher my snapscore but since they didn't send which I didn't know people didn't receive them so I lost all of my snapscore and they were really high so really annoyed hopefully Snapchat can do something about it.,0
"Probably going to uninstall.. the adds are one thing (which I still hate to be honest) but being forced to ""discover"" people I have zero interest in and never once chose to want to see is annoying beyond words.. not to mention that it is literally impossible to contact anyone that worked for or with this company.",0
"There is a lack of video stabilization in Snapchat on the S24 Ultra. Additionally, when adding text to a video, the text appears significantly reduced in size after posting. A substantial update is required to address these issues and the numerous bugs present in the application.",0
"pretty good compared to iPhone, but desperately needs to be optimized for the flip 5. text gets lost at bottom of screen all the time, and it doesn't say what's a memory and what's a new picture on stories",0
"I installed the snapchat app on my computer, it asks me to open the phone app and confirm that i am trying to access snapchat for web......I have used a different email address and password on the computer to what i used on the phone. Nothing has come up, so it looks like the web app relies on the phone app to sync all the info. to open the web app on the computer. Thats an issue right there, as it is not stand alone on the computer. What if you dont have a mobile phone??",0
Why for the love of god would you disable double tap to switch between cameras while recording? Ever heard of muscle memory? I can live with the bootleg tiktok style trash inbetween my friends storys but why make the most central part of your app less usable than it was before? Please fix!,0
"I've been experiencing significant issues with the Snapchat app on my device. Whenever I activate the snap camera, it lags and abruptly shuts down. This has been persistent, and I hope the developers can address and resolve this issue promptly.",0
"Well snapchat I think there are some up and downs, firstly I think you should have an option for 3d/2d and secondly I think you should remove the tokens immediately. Other than that great app to use but it does have its downfalls.",0
I use this app daily on my phone and i decided to download the app on my cromebook... it doesn't work it takes me to the log in screen and i go to sign in and then the app just disappears... i have been using the web part of snap on my computer when i can't use my phone and i can't even open snaps people have sent me unless it is on my phone... this app is great overall i love it it just doesn't work for cromebooks... please fix the app for chromebooks.,0
Everything good except I'm not getting the public figure option and wide angle lens option in my new phone. It automatically does have that option but it isn't showing on snapchat. I even reported the issue but no action was taken against it.,0

"I've been using this app for over a decade as soon as it launched in 2011. Every so often their would be major issues that cause my experience using the app to be poor. Examples include: Snapchats constantly never sending until you turn on airplane mode and back off (not even a guarantee), the ""send to"" button will disappear and you'll have to close and reopen the app, and just a handful of little bugs that seem to stick around for ages. It's still a wonderful app, but it really needs work.",1
"I like snap, however... It now will sometimes auto play your flashbacks when you swipe up and open the memories, and some of the flashbacks really trigger my PTSD and depression and there's so many snaps I can't just delete them all so like... It would be nice if that stopped. Like, please. Maybe also an option to turn off flashbacks completely or something idk. I just definitely want the auto play to stop. Unless im missing a setting somewhere, I don't see an option to turn any of that off.",1
"I went from an iPhone to an Android. My friends use iPhones and because Apple doesn't have RCS yet, this is my alternative. It works and does what you need it to. The annoying part and why it's not a 5, is because you can't turn off the ""..is typing"" notification. I don't like that you can't turn that off. I don't need my phone buzzing twice when I need to know when a message comes in. Please include this option. Thank you!",1
DISABLE subtitles as default setting. They automatically turn on every channel you watch or if you skip ads. Yellow progress bar is useless. If I back out or don't finish something it makes you start over some times? And if I've seen the same episode of anything before DON'T show it as new/suggested/unseen. How doesn't the app know if I've watched something or not. And why do I need to refresh the app to tell it I just finished watching something? Borderline spam filtering.,1
"Needs another update! Some of my videos with sound plays but, you can't hear anything even with the volume turned all the way up. I just found out if I re-save them it goes back to normal, I have a ton of snaps with sound and that will take forever to do. Someone please fix this. I like to rewatch my snaps without extra work.",1
"I've been using this for about a year. It ok and all, but here are some of my issues. 1. You can't remove the ai unless u pay for premium, which is really annoying. 2.

When I log out of accounts, it takes a very long time, but if u exit out the app, then it glitches, and I have to uninstal and reinstall",1
"I recently got a new phone, the Pixel 8 Pro. And Snapchat runs smoothly. But whenever I use the phones back camera's, it seems like it doesn't know how to properly switch between the different lenses when zooming in and out. It ends up making it very jittery and hard to anticipate. I've loved using this app since I started using it. I just want to see it get better. And Little bugs like that decrease the quality of the app overall. Hopefully this is fixed soon.",1
"Constant unnecessary notifications that can't be turned off without turning off all notifications, mostly pertaining to when someone posts. Plus, they've taken features and made them exclusive for Premium, which I (and most others) have zero interest in. Aside from that, it works well most of the time. Snap isn't social media; it's instant messaging.",1
"There are so many ads in stories (friend's and general) it's almost pointless to watch them half the time... Free app, I get it, but the ad amount is practically outweighing the actual content. There's also a lot of features/app settings only able to be changed/turned off with the premium (paid) version now, including the permanent top-of-messaging AI confirming this to be true. I still like it for talking to friends/keeping streaks, but that's the only reason I haven't uninstalled it.🥲🫠",1
"There are always new little bugs that are super annoying. As soon as one seems to be fixed, theres a new issue somewhere else. Most recently, the button to post to ""My Story"" doesn't work. I've found other ways to post what I want but why have a quick button if it isn't going to work. Also, not sure when it happened but at some point everything that I post stopped automatically saving to Memories, I just want to know why? I've been using Snapchat less and less.",1
"Whatever recent updates have been made have broken this app. I barely ever get notification sounds any longer, nor does it activate my screen. I haven't changed any settings. I suddenly just don't get notifications for some reason, so I keep missing messages from people. And then some messages are coming in super late. Never had these issues before.",1
"I have been using snapchat since it came out. The last month or so, it has been extremely glitchy. I start typing a message, and the app shuts down and closes. If I'm watching snaps I have received, it will shut off as well. It's very trusting having to open and close the app multiple times to send a message. Snapchat is one of my main ways of communication with friends and family, and I've loved it so much until now. Would love this issue resolved so I can go back to loving the app.",1
"It's an amazing app I would recommend this app for many people, so I recommend a 5 minute ad about this app for more people to download it. I only have one issue I can't view any story with out an ad popping up every 5 second I cant even continue watching with out restarting the whole vid over again. Update: it's still happening also can you please remove the screenshot so the other person doesn't get notified when you took one of the chat it's annoying tbh.",1
"i use snapchat as my daily messaging app. there are a few things i wish were different though. for example, i want to be able to interact with the filters im using in the call. i dislike the way the bitmojis look and wish it would go back to the 2D models. i also find the AI bot annoying. i dont like how its automatically at the top of ny messages when i dont use it. there should be a free way to delete it or at least unpin it. these changes would make the app so much better.",1
"Snapchat is a great platform for capturing life stories, but the app's performance can be quite frustrating. During the holidays, when documenting precious moments is crucial, I've encountered numerous bugs that hinder the overall experience. Constant glitches and crashes have made it challenging to rely on Snapchat for capturing those special memories and replay them. I hope the developers address these issues soon to enhance user satisfaction.",1
"The camera tends to turn at a 90° angle for no apparent reason. Aside from that, I wiuld also like to mention the fact that there are WAY too many advertisements within Snapchats discovery pages. It tends to be very irritating when I try to watch videos on Snapchat but I cannot do so because there are repetetive interruptions that keep me from enjoying my videos. Aside from those 2 problems, Snapchat is a recommended app from me. 3 stars.",1
"When it works, it works; and when it doesn't, it's because of ""updates"" and ""fixes."" The filters are amazing. The ability to connect seamlessly is great. But almost every update results in slow log-in time, reduced speed in posting and sending snaps, and reduced access to my friends' stories.",1
"So I downloaded snapchat, and at first it was a great experience. Although, after a while, I started realizing that the notifications would get annoying. So I turned off notifications, but then I noticed that I wouldn't get phone calls. So I turned notifications back on, and then I started to get addicted. Also, the filters made me doubt my looks, so I was starting to insecure when I looked in the mirror. Overall, it's a fun app, but it does have its downsides.",1
"The new Bitmoji character models and stickers are absolutely awful. They look very creepy and 3-D, and the stickers are the same as the 2-D version before but with the 3-D characters now slapped into it which clashes and makes the 3-D characters look even weirder. The expressions on the 3-D models are also very unsettling. Please Snapchat. Go back to the 2-D version you had before. It was so so so much nicer to look at, and customize. Other than that, your app is okay.",1
"I have really enjoyed this app as a more personal social media experience. It's great for talking with friends directly and has plenty of cool features. However, it seems like some exec out there has been actively trying to make the app worse every update. Between the My AI (that they ""removed"" and then quietly readded), and now pushing Public Profiles that can't be disabled. It just feels like every other social media. Most of my friends have already left the app, I feel I might be next.",1
"Still one of my most used apps but absolutely lacking on QoL updates. Black theme was finally added after actual years but there is no system theme switch option. You still cannot control the notifications so getting multiple video chats just buzzes constantly. One notification per user is plenty. I don't need one per message or message ""status"".",1
"Very good app, but my Snapchat started to act up, leading me to stop seeing messages that are being sent, and wouldn't let me send a message. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled and nothing helped, the first time I clicked on Snapchat, my phone restarted. (My phone isn't a older model either.) The second time it wouldn't let me log in. Very good, but FILLED with bugs. They don't fix them even though they say they do, and the reason I say that is because, I keep on running into the same problem",1
"Just updated, and they've changed the text. It's difficult for me to read now and the letters are different sizings, i.e., the o's and s's are squashed and look strange. The u's look larger than other lowercase letters. Overall, it's a pointless update that achieves nothing and doesn't improve the app whatsoever. If there was an option to change the font that isn't paid for, for people with impairments this would be great.",1
Why are all my favorites deleted!? And AI that pops up every time I text somebody is creepy and weird and I don't want it there at all I hate it please give an option to remove! Also the ads are beyond ridiculous as soon as you say a word you got ads coming out the yin yang for it that's also creepy and weird... I put a toque on with my long hair and hour later there was an ad for a toque with built-in long hair😖,1
"This app infact is pretty good....like the filters and everything....but recently it seems to few issues; 1) sometimes it takes an hour to send snaps, 2) The filter doesn't load, 3) The filters don't work well, 4) I can't text My AI nor can I see the text from it or the sent text from mine, 5) sometimes also fails to send the snap...... please take this into consideration and fix it, Thankyou!",1
"It's a really great app with lot's of cool filters but my Snapchat isn't recording videos, like when I long press a filter it just shows the yellow stuff around the filter but it never records, have tried updating it, uninstall and installing back but it's still the same results. Please you should really do something about it.",1
"It's a good way to communicate with your peers and is much like most communication apps. However, it's also a social platform that can maybe cause life risking situations if not careful with who you meet online. Personally I don't like how it constantly asks me to leak my location, it tends to be anyonying at times. Overall good app, would recommend to mainly teens, young adults, and adults. If children use this app, parents sould be cautious with who their kids are messaging.",1
"It's fun to make your own posts but that's about it. At this point, if you wanna watch ANYBODY'S story, especially if it's a long one, there's gonna be an ad literally every 10-15 seconds, it's insane what we've been reduced to at this point. Ads ads ads ads ads ads everywhere on everything, constantly...",1
"Good app, works great, kinda laggy, but the two problems i have with this app is that: the AI. It's super creepy, and I can only unfriend if I get snapchat + which i am not getting. If I won't be able to unfrined this AI, I will delete this app. 2ndly, when I'm calling my friends, it randomly hangs up, and it doesn't for them, so i have to tell them to call again and go back to whatever we were doing. And it happens every 2 freaking secinds! Please fix this. 3 stars . ★★★☆☆",1
"It's a great app and a great way to stay connected but when I watch spotlight I see a lot of inappropriate things and I can't have it on both my old phone and new phone at the same time, which is really annoying and it lags a lot so if you could please fix the lagging and get rid of the inappropriate things on spotlight I'll rate 5 stars",1
"I love the app and I mainly use it to talk to my friends but my camera on it had stopped working a couple days ago and I keep getting a message saying ""Snapchat was unable to open the camera. You may need to restart the application or your device"" and I've tried EVERYTHING I could think of. I restarted my phone, I deleted the app and redownloaded it, and I closed out of the app. Nothing is working! Snapchat, please fix this!",1
I had to give it 3 stars because of the constant notifications of having new friend suggestions. Like who even uses it? Its useless to me and it would be amazing to turn of its notifications. Same with the videos notifications because I don't watch them as YouTube is superior. Overall good app to chat with some friends who are on it.,1
"Actually I am using this app from last 2 year, but from 2024 I started facing some problem like : I have good internet connection but spotlight is not working and : suddenly the spotlight is end and not scrolling any more after updating also the problem didn't solve that's why I am rating the app only 3 star and : I request the management to take the problem seriously otherwise they lost there user's .......",1
One should be able to tap and pick multiple people to remove as friends I need to add more friends but I can't cause it keeps saying I have more than enough friends on my Snapchat Please for the next update I should be able to pick once like 30 of them to remove as friends to have other friends too my friends too are complaining about it also,1
Was great until it wasnt. All my other previous phones have used this app flawlessly until i got my new galaxy S23. Now when i take any picture and post it to my story its very blurry when it was a clear photo to begin with. Not sure what is going on with it but recently started doing this. Have tried taking different pictures and posting numerous times with the same result please address this issue thank you.,1
"It glitches too much even after updated. Whenever I post a ""My Story"" with music & no limit viewing, most of the time the song glitches only playing for a couple of seconds rather than the max. I hate the hassle of constantly existing the app in order to fix the bug",1
"I love this app, I've been using it for a steady 3 years or so. I just really wish that it would let me use the icon change feature that is on my phone, WITHOUT buying the stupid subscription. Ever since you guys made the AI and plus update it has gone severely down hill.",1
"App is kinda cool really. But i can't see when my freinds is online or offline. If you want to know if they are online or offline you need to share your live location otherwise we can't see their online, last seen. And now there is a premium features but still they haven't added online and last seen feature for premium version.... Please add this feature on premium version please otherwise premium feature sucks really. And there are some lag when opening this app",1
"Notifications are not reliable. Sometimes I get them sometimes I don't. Biggest issue with new update is when I go to my camera roll and have to go thru all memories first before I can see anything. Please fix this, I'm not always mentally prepared for the walk down memory lane.",1
"Camera is distorted Every now and then it appears horizontal and stretched out even tho my phone is not horizontal. I take a picture and it goes back to vertical with no distortion. Only happens on this app. Also I hate the AI, always in the way. And I hate the add your college thay never goes away",1
"This app is one of the easiest way to convey a message to family/friends, but this app doesn't allow me to watch spotlight reels, it will stop showing reels after watching 5 reels also there are many ads in this app, which is very irritating. Pls fix this issue.",1
"Good app!! But if we are buying subscription like i did, I'm expecting more features it doesnt even provides the feature it says it will like sneak peek, we cant see the friend who has sneak peaked i was expecting it will send notification for it but guess whatt it didnt!! Other thing is story rewatch it says someone has rewatched my story but doesnt tell who!! And other thing is same no. of streak recover chances as any not subscribed person.So whats the point of subscribing and spending money",1
Yall need to fix the bug that has flashbacks pop up first and that u have to scroll through in order to get to your dlsaved memories its very annoying. And before you ask try opening up settings on an android phone that flashback feature is NOT available so it's annoying and unfixable from the user's side,1
"This is a really great app and I love it so much but there is an issue. I'm not sure as to why the games were removed from the app but I feel like it was a big mistake. In 2018 I would find myself on this app the whole day just playing the mini games with my friends and making new friends, but now I just open the app to take pictures. It was really fun with the games and I feel that if the games could come back your ratings would skyrocket. Overall, it is a really fun and fantastic app.",1
"It's really annoying that after snapchat updated and added a bunch of stuff, my story no longer flows. Like, it stays on one segment of a snap and repeats it instead of just playing the next. I have updated the app multiple times since they added all the new things but it still has that problem. Please fix that.",1
It's a wonderful app for taking pictures in different effects and everything is good but something is wrong .. sometimes it will just stop working only u can see a blank page u can't find ur friends .. it's just so frustrating. I want everyone to recommend using but don't get eddicted,1
I do love using Snapchat alot to keep intouch with my friends however I have random robot thing appearing out of the blue with an 'x' next to their name and sometimes I put a text on a snap and when I go to send it the message deletes off of the snap and I have to re write it again and I have updated my Snapchat all the time and it stays the same.,1
It's a very good app but it's like glitching too much. I am a 2019th user and I never had any complain from this app but now it's glitching that much..like I upload my story and then I don't see my story like I am not able to see my story and This is happening everytime I upload my story..overall it's a fantastic app but if you can fix it I would be very thankful..thanks!,1
This app is good but idk it has some issues like sometimes the chat feed doesn't show up or it won't work and it gives a lot of headache. It won't even show it on snap web. The chat feed won't load even after so many tries. This needs to be resolved or atleast inform what has happened and how can it be fixed.,1
"after the most recent update, there has constantly been a notification that is in the way of my chats that says ""unread messages"" when i have no unopened snaps. fix this immediately, please, cus it's quite annoying getting a notification for absolutely nothing every single time i get on the app.",1
"When I type in a date in my memories it doesn't show up and sometimes instead of showing me the normal most recent memories it gets on my year ago today thing and won't go away, the 3d bitmojis are actually terrifying, no one uses the tiktok knock off thing, when I press send it doesnt send so I have to make the snap all over again and sometime restart the app.",1
"Once a year, almost every year, snapchat makes me remake my account and I lose all my stuff. It's odd. Not really looking for a solution as I've already remade it. All other functions are fine, it just kinda bugs me that I have to do that every so often",1
"ok, so, im on chromebook, and ive been having alot of problems with this app. its a great app on my phone, but, when i try to log in or sign up, when it starts loading into the account, it just crashes. its very annoying. please fix this!",1
"Always been mid, be staying mid. New update with the stories feature that allows you to scroll up or down to swap snap stories is actually dogshit, especially in combination with the unskippable ads. Used to be able to swipe out of a video and go back in to avoid ads and now I just don't watch stories so that's nifty.",1
Its an awsome app and i love it its great for communication with video calls but the screen keeps going green or tinting green while im on calls both either for me or the person calling Its showing one side green and it was fine at first with restarting the app but now it doesnt work. If possible please FIX it. Anyone else?,1
"I am removing two stars because recently I am facing a problem that is, whenever I try to add songs to my videos I automatically come out and the screen goes dark. Not once not twice but everytime and this is very irritating. I will request to please have a look on this problem. 🙏",1
"Chats and calls work fine, this is normally what I FaceTime my boyfriend on. When I try to change my name it won't let me say it, I can't see my own stories, and I can't edit friendships anymore. Basically, every save button is broken.",1
"The location below a contact's name in the chat flickers and is very inconsistent. I cannot see it most of the time even though the location is shared with me. Also, too many repetitive ads now while watching stories.",1
The app overall is good when it comes to what it does. I just have a problem with the age some random people can friend you but you don't know their age. I just wanted to ask if yall could add an age button to the tab/bio so it's easier. That young kids don't talk to 23 year Olds,1
"I got some issues from the snap for past one week. Its been stopping a lot . I can't even take pictures, I can't process anything. Resolve these bugs please. I'm facing problems for past week's. I even updated it two times, I cleared all cache. Forcestopped once. Still nothing happened. I'm not even getting my friend snaps",1
"Umm.... The reason for giving 3 stars is from today mrng i was unable to text my friends through this app I'm unable to delete the stories,unable to log out also my network are fine only but still it's showing server went wrong kindly find the mistake where the app is lagging and fix the bugg. Rather than it is a nice app only.Thank you!",1
"I feel it should have more designs for the backgrounds. Based off what you do as a living! Have backgrounds that's more reliable. Example: If a person does construction, a nurse, vet, and or sales rep etc give backgrounds as to job based as well. I feel that will be great!",1
Great app for texting and video sharing. Just have problems with saving and lacking the bounce back feature on Android. Introduce an auto save setting because sometimes we can be forgetful. Add the bounce back feature too on Android.,1
"App is good.. But for sometime I want a break from snapchat, so i wanted to delete my account temporarily.. I have been trying from past 5 days to delete but every time an error occurs. Please fix this issue. It's really getting tough time for me. Thank u.",1
"Hey there Snapchat, I would like to bring into your notice that from last night we are unable to send and snaps or messages to our friends on snapchat. Tried to reinstall the application but I lost all my friends which where added to my profile. Request your to look into this matter. Thank you.",1
Snapchat is a good app to keep in contact with your friends. Also I love the flashback function! Unfortunately there is one big problem. Snapchat isn't saving the whole video when I make one. When I look back at the video it doesn't fully show it. That is very sad.,1
"I really like the app, I connect with friends on here all the time, however there's a bug where the captions to my snaps will be deleted and my friend's messages will disappear after they type it all, please fix these bugs, thanks",1
"Assalam o Alaikum. This app is unique on it's own so I can't say that it's bad. But there are some bugs in it. The first one idk that whether it's a bug or not but when I type somthing and go back for my mistakes. It keeps messing things up. Idk how to explain that, and the second is; not alot of people use sc+ so please make atleast some of the features useable for normal users so there's a bit more interest. And the last issue being stated is that MyAi, it's not working. No text is showing up.",1
stop sending me notifications of random girls posting on the Spotlight section. I don't want to see it and I DO NOT CARE. And when I press and hold a story it freezes ?? Neither of those things ever happened before and I would've liked it to stay that way.,1
This is a good app but i want to share many problems i faced while using snap.First of all whenever i select all my shortcuts and send snap it shows 'failed to send' so i have to select shortcuts quite a few times which takes a lot of time.Also pls add the feature to select all people for updating shortcuts.,1
It was all good until the last few updates where I can't customize my character or my ai's character and like 1 second into the customize character It kicks me out. I can message fine but it's just the customizing characters.,1
Since recent update wi cannot add text to a video. The video will never upload/add to my stories if there is text on them. Photo does upload if text is added but not videos. Tried on data. On wifi. Short vids long vids no difference. Please send help 🤣😭,1
"The app is fun to use, but the filters have get worse over time. I can't explain what's worse the simple fact that I can't get access to an old account of mine and the ridiculous security precautions we have to take in order to even log in OR the fact that I remember the email, username, and phone number associated with my account but no longer have access to them anymore which affects my ability to log in or to have a representative even aid in helping me. Wack asf!",1
"It's nice, I can talk to the AI. AHAHAHAHAA Anyways, the filters are like the common one but it works really nice, tho some filters are kinda cringe. When it comes to messaging, I don't like it that it vanished when you are done talking to someone, so people probably use Snapchat if they want to talk to people secretly or they commonly known as ""Cheating"" coz when their partners check the chatbox they cannot find a message history. That's all.🥱",1
"It's a great app, however I've recently had a problem where sending anything is taking longer than it should to send. & today i woke up to it not sending anything at all. updated it thinking that'll solve the issue, it has not. it also says i have no internet connection which is wrong & it's definitely not my internet. please fix this",1
"I loved this app, but ever since the last update the filters don't work. Any filter that alters someone's face, I can take a picture but I can't take video anymore. The audio will come up normally and yet the video is like it's doing a slideshow, each frame holds for 5 seconds before switching to the next. Most of the app functions normally but filters that alter people's faces just will not work and it's driving me insane. They worked a couple weeks ago so what did you guys do????",1
"I lost my streaks even though I paid within the given time. I'm expecting to be given my money back, even if it is just 99p. Also, the AI chat is pretty pointless, and from what I know, you can't delete it. It can lag quite a lot too, especially when recording. However, it's alright for chatting and scrolling on videos, and the filters are fun.",1
"Having used snapchat for 11 years am super disappointed with the change to bitmoji look and search. The new cameo and gif should not show in bitmoji search, I only want bitmoji not the trash stickers that have been added. Also bitmoji in the app looks fine but in snapchat they've changed the look and it is gross. Please revert, thanks.",1
i am using a chromebook and on chromebook it used to wrok perfectly fine and it does on my phone and tablet but now for some reason whenever i try to open snapchat on my chromebook its just a yellow background with a logo and it wont do anything else and its very annpying as i rely on this for my streaks because i get my phone taken frequently and i have to rely on friends to send my streaks it makes me angry ive uninstalled it and reinstalled it so many times and still nothing its just annoying,1
I have noticed over the last 6 months or so that when viewing a friend's story it's all current when I know some are memories. It used to say memory in the top left but now it only shows the hour it was shared instead. Why??,1
"I love Snap so much that I've been using it for 3 years, but there is one problem. After installing its update, I couldn't load in my custom character properly as it takes long to load.",1
cool app but if we need to remove anyone from friends so we can there was no options But this is very good application I love it and so break we need more filter and when today I am going for some work to garden so my friends said let's click pics on snap we use filter I love goggles but we are four friends but any two have that goggles this is cool app but some features are not working correctly so please try to fix that and at this feature also two people are there so all can use filter 😇,1
"First, there should be an AUTOSAVE feature for chats. Second, CHAT COLOR should be a free feature because it's so basic. Third, there must be an option to remove MyAI. It's been stuck in the top of my chat list for weeks and I didn't even open it or agree to its terms yet. Last, there should be an option to remove astrological cards from your profile.",1
"I feel the app has gotten a bit worse for Android over the last year. My main issue is selecting a lens for a snap after you took it. You scroll to select one and it scrolls back to default. Sometimes you select one and it moves back one. Keeps doing this for a while until it randomly works. Sometimes the lens doesn't even show up after finally being selected. Also, please allow us turn off notifications for receiving snaps alone! And not snaps and chats together.",1
"This is more a quest for help rather than a review. Whenever I open the app, my phone starts vibrating.. I have tried everything but it just doesn't stop. Very annoying.. Which makes me not use the app as frequently as I used to. Any suggestions?",1
I don't know what happened suddenly but i can't watch more than 3 or 4 spotlight and whenever I scroll it's just stuck on those 3 or 4 spotlights that's it and when I refresh the feed still those same spotlights are shown...please do something about this problem.,1
"I really like the app, but snapchat has made the bitmojis look awful. Why did you change them to 3D? I want the old Bitmojis back! Also I'm really bummed that Android devices have so much less than iPhone. They have better camera quality, dark theme... This is just a couple of things that iOS users have that Android users don't. I would love that if you fix this.",1
"Love the app, great for friends. But I hate what you did to the bitmojis. Android users already have to pay for snapchat plus just to get dark mode, now we have to pay for new clothes that are released. The bitmoji update also sucks, they look ugly snd gross. Removing 2D was also a sucky idea too. We all loved 2D. Bring the old bitmojis back.",1
i want to see the video count down wheel again when viewing videos from friends again. without it if i need to exit (without finishing videos all at once) i now end up missing several seconds of the videos,1
Some settings of this app was not able like I want to change birthday but it can't changed ..........I tried lots of times but nothing happened ..........but this app more better to use in our daily life without any problems .........we can use this..................... but sometimes don't what's wrong going with this app............ whenever I want to mute my notification they can't going to be mute I request to you pls.. some settings of snapchat .........................,1
All is good but the worst features for me is that when i have to choose lense i have to click one by one cause when i swipe the lense it wouldn't stop It stops after a lot of rain. please fix it.,1
"I was checking all the features and i found an option called ""my public figure"". I thought of doing something about it, so when I try to add things to that, it says ""something is wrong, please try again later"". Again after 2days when I try to add things, same thing again🤷‍♀️. My network and everything is fine. I hope I can get clarity with this. Other than that it's an amazing app.",1
"This is an Okay app, when you search for a username of someone else (so you can add them as friends) it brings up every other username except the one that you typed in. Also, there should be a setting to turn Off the snap map thing. Also, I have noticed that there are proifiles with hurtful content for stories and this app simple allows them to get as many views without being banned. And please add it so I can add more characters to the title of my story. Thanks for reading my review.",1
Fix the shazam feature on snapchat. I cant view my history. From neither menu. The menu that pops up after you shazam a song no longer has a history button which sucks and the shazam section under my profile doesnt record the songs I shazam regardless if i like them or not. Thats prolly the most useful feature for me and its broken. Please fix it.,1
hate the AI feature at top of friend list. used to be able to remove. also hate seeing random people story suggestions. I only want to view my friends stuff. wish I could turn these off,1
This application is one of the easiest way to communicate with my friends and family members as well as clicking and saving memories but from last 2-3 months i'm unable to open *my favourite* music audios even though other like recent audios etc open up but *my favourite* won't. I've updated even uninstalled and reinstalled the app every time it requires any update but still i'm unable to open it i've also reported the bug in application itself but of no use.. I hope this bug will be fixed soon.,1
There are some bugs and there are certain options that i can't even find and it's not showing like (multi snap option) it is not showing to me for some months so kindly requested to fix those bugs,1
"I have tried for years to connect my email to my snapchat account and remove it from the previous account that I never use and add it to my account that I've had for nearly 7 years. I set up two step verification with my number but I recently changed it and cannot login. And when I look online it says that I HAVE to make a new account but I don't want to lose all my friends and memories. Why can I not try to verify my identity, even Instagram has a way where I can take a video to verify it is me",1
"My id has suddenly gone like it does not include my any chats and even if i take a snap and then try to send it then there is no friends in that list... why? What's the problem? I mean i want to use it , my all streaks would be broken if you don't take timely steps! A kind request to do stmg 'bout it! PLEASE!",1
"I don't know if am the only one experiencing this..... When trying to take a selfie, a purple and black spot covers the screen, thereby making it impossible to use the particular filter you had proposed to use.",1
Snapchat is not working properly in android system. We are not able to send each other chats and snaps. The stories and spotlights are all visible and good but this is the main problem that's occurring. Kindly fix this issue ASAP.,1
I mean its an overall great app butttt!!! when i a try to use it on my chromebook thats when the problems start. Although if these problems were to be fixed it would be great.,1
The app is good and it also provides data about the users profile but when I received my data from where I wanted to know about how many and who are the people who saw my story on snapchat. It doesn't provided me that information. So I suggest to also involve the names of viewer for making working easy for the app user,1
It was good but the avatars are so bad now. Same with the clothing. The 3D look is just not nice and a lot of people agree. I think if the avatars went back to how they were before it would be better. Overall apart from the avatars the app is pretty good you can chat with friends and take nice photos,1
"As a teen I believe this app is horrible at it's protection of them. There have been at least 3 times where sexual videos have shows up on public spotlight. If teens are the main people being catered to then censorship of this content should be taken more seriously. As in prevented more and dealt with more. However, despite this the apps features are fun and if you keep your DM's private to only friends you shouldn't get too many bad images there.",1
I want to change my birth year in my profile and i'm not able to change it ....This app doesn't fix bugs. I have reported same thing many times in I NEED HELP section .... but the bug didn't fix till now also ... i hope i will get clarity of this here . Other than this its an amzing app.,1
"▪︎Add an option to refresh quick-add list. ▪︎Add an option to send snaps to all friends at once. ▪︎Add an option into snapmap to search for all the bitmoji stickers. ▪︎Add more bitmoji poses and backgrounds. ▪︎Add tons of clothes, jackets, shoes, accessories and outfits for different jobs.",1
Camera roll isn't backup is repeating from last month and doesn't shows my camera roll also but when I check the back-up list it's all clear but I don't know why it is showing like that please solve the issue. I'm already sent a mail also but didn't respond yet.,1
I really used to like this app it was a fun way to communicate with friends and make memories but when you guys changee the birmoji emojis to make them look realistic you made look like they are being held at gunpoint. Other that everything else is fine,1
I love this app but every time I receive an ad for it rage courses through me. I enjoy marketing and the main audience of this app is teens and young adults and the ads try to focus on that audience but all the ads feel like they were made by 70 year Olds trying to be hip and it fails. Good app ads just enrage me,1
"It's fine. But for the love of God , get rid of snap streaks. I don't want to pay for your app, stop asking me to every day. I don't care about streaks. I just want to use it when I want to. But I can't talk to someone without seeing s failed streak. It lingers for days and days. Like shut up bro. Please remove this feature. I don't care",1
App good but the worst thing is that the baby filter does not work in making video. It get stuck at a point. I'm unable to make videos by baby filter. Kindly fix this problem please.,1
Excellent app.. I loved It too much.. but there is a security problem it app doesn't have security and privacy and doesn't provide security to our chats and photos.. so I request please solve this issue and make it more secure..,1
Ultra wide lens was introduced to Samsung S21FE and suddenly after an update it was removed. Such a poor way to pull away a feature Android users were waiting for. Need an answer for pulling it off and when can we expect this simple feature back??,1
"In the most recent update for snapchat, they changed the font, and it is quite literally throwing me off at this point because it looks so irregular. Please change it back.",1
The only problem I have is you need to make it to where anyone can remove the ai in their chats I personally think it's an invasion of privacy and don't know what it could do to my snapchat id like it gone and I know a couple other people who would too I would appreciate feedback on this because I might just end up getting rid of it because of said feature,1
"Fine, new update sucks... I don't like that the stories aren't full screen anymore and that when I try to save a photo/media in a chat I have to press right next to it instead of anywhere on the line where the photo/media is",1
Why the story option is given in middle my many photos while saving get uploaded as story. Literally this is very annoying even personal photos while saving get uploaded as story. The second issue is why I can't save save my snap in my own chat I'm not getting the option of saving it on my chat .,1
After updating my snap I'd is not coming please fix it as soon as possible. It getting stuck from last update but now its completely gone.. data is not coming for snapchat but it's working for other apps..my snap is not working I have uninstalled and installed again but its not working.. please fix it,1
It's 2024. Get rid of those annoying ads during the videos. Makes me want to delete the app. Fix it. Not to mention I shouldn't be premium to delete the useless AI or have dark mode on Snap. Step up the game.,1
Hi..... Snapchat is such an awesome application.....but I have a problem I've been using it since August 2022 upto January 2024 and I deleted the application because my phone's storage was low and now I've reinstalled it again I logged back into my account but it did not restore all my photos the only ones that were restored are from August to October 2022 what do I do because I want all my photos back please 🥺,1
"I love snap I do, but my notifications won't work, I've tried everything, I've messed with the settings on snap, I've messed with the settings on my phone, I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app to see if that would work and nothing will work",1
Was great so far. So erhing fun to take my mind off of everyday life.. only had this apo for a week so far. Tonight all I can send someone are glitchy squares? It doesn't need updated. I exited and cleared it from my background. That didn't help either..,1
When I first got this app it worked great but with the new updates and stuff when I switch my account and then back again it deletes all my chats that I had. Even the pinned ones! Honestly it's still a good app apart from that part.,1
Actually I even getting the same issue related to this app. It giving so much trouble like hanging all the GPS locations but also work good with this app.Its connects with more of the friends whom we doesn't know at all.,1
"Hey team snap chat, I just love your app but i wanna say you a big problem that is happening with me for the past few months, Everytime i go to the 'saved snap' section, i see the thumbnails of the pic, but when i open that pic, there is a completely different pic",1
"This app is over all fine like not too bad nor too good. It DO Lags alot while opening. I enjoyed Snapchat due to their Minis (Minigames). I don't know why and when they stopped the Minis. Please, It would be great if you bring back Minis.",1
I really like this app but the new update in bitemoji is good but really ugly like seriously that looks soo worse and it's not fair that only iPhone users can use dark mode even Android phones should have an option for dark mode. App sometimes be laggy but only sometimes and other all the things are good And I think u should add ABAYA for muslims please?,1
Messages disappearing feature shouldn't be implemented. It causing lot of inconvenience as I couldn't go back and live in the past.,1
"How does any blocked user can see my public stories and profile... Fix this issue...very disappointing, anyone could have freedom to see my profile but how can a block user? Then what is the point of block that user? All over very good app👍, but it's a request fix this issue also there are many lag in public profile.",1
"Meh. It's been like 10 plus years and it's still unnecessarily difficult to record hands-free video with your selfie camera. Instead of adding more bs filters no one likes and sponsored accounts, you should add this feature.",1
"Okay ig,The bad side is that when you use this app on your computer it ownt load atleast for me it wont.Ive been sitting on the main screen for 30 minutes now and it wont move at all even after ive resized the screen and done everything please fix this.",1
"It time to tell why I gave 3 stars to this app . I love this app and really like to spend more time on this app chatting with my friends but on the other hand I face 3 problems 1. Someone can login my id and I don't know that who is the person logging my id why it's my id and I should know. 2.If I try to send any photo / video it send link not photo / videos . 3.If I don't have my friends id who use Snapchat you can't find them even I don't have option of 'My contacts.""",1
This app stop responding everytime when I open it after clicking soo much it do not respond and close automatically. I got fed up with this issue don't know why this is happening in this app. So my request you to is please take serious action towards it.,1
"Everything is almost good but, I am not able to save my snaps in my chat, I mean those snaps which I sent to myself. Before I am able to save them in chat but after updating the app, I am not able to save them in my own chat. Please correct this.🙏🏻",1
"Okay, so I really, really love snapchat because it's just so good with all the filters, bitmojis, groups, and all that stuff!! But one thing makes me really sad. Where are the games that you could once play on snap? Like bitmoji party. I really miss it so please bring these back 😭",1
"It's a nice app but nowadays whenever I click on the camera roll option in chats, it shows ""nothing to show - you have nothing in your camera roll"". Please sort this out",1
There is bug or whatever something. It's not accepting my Snapchat+ membership payment through fam pay app. Can you just fix it? Because I really need it. I don't have any other bank account. All I have is fampay. So fix it please as soon as possible. And reply me also.,1
The app was great. But now it lags too much and the bitmojis look so damn weird. The earlier bitmojis were good frl. And the app lags every time you try a filter.,1
Why Snapchat is not providing ultra wide angle features to all users??? Everytime I click photos it makes the photos look bad due to unavailability of this feature! Kindly please work on this.,1
I've had snapchat before but idk if it's my Internet or the app but whenever I take a snap it freezes and then I have reset the app and I'm actually quite mad that they took of the game feature. Also I'm actually annoyed that we can't unfriend the Ai and why would I buy something just to unfriend a robot And the new bitmojii 3d version is horrible.A.so PLEASE👏 ADD A👏 PAUSE ✌BUTTON 👏FOR SPOTLIGHT👏. And like in general we all want old snapchat back it was better this update isn't upgrade 3⭐,1
This is a 50/50 firstly the ai thing is horrible I that I was bored and I didn't want to watch anything to my AI and guess what? It showed I video on spotlight are u kidding me ok now the good part so it is very good for connecting with friends and chatting with them so also when I need filters I search them up and I find not what I'm looking for it is very nice but at the same time bad 😔 not good at all to me anyway still the ai thing is horrible I don't like it are u kidding me anyway bye bye,1
"This app is soo cool for me ! But suddenlyy today , when i open my camera of snapchat that wasn't opened , that was so irritating man . I updated and unistalled and again reinstalled but my provlem wasn't solved it was so annoying i want to say that plzz solve this as soon as possible😩☺️",1
This app has so many glitches all the time i would have to restart my phone becoz of this app all the time this app screen is freezes and i cant send snaps to other Plz im requesting you to plz repair this problem becoz so many times it should happen and i cant tolerate this anymore. Thank you,1
Camera glitches sideways or doesn't work most of the time and ruins it when trying to make a quick snap. Only things wrong besides the maneuvering because they change it often,1
"Ever since my phone updated, my Snapchat hasn't been working. It won't let me take pictures or snaps, and it's been telling me for a couple of days now I had to reboot my phone Or I had to uninstall the app for making everything work than it will go back to that Colicing",1
"I'm giving Snapchat a solid three stars because even though I love the app however there's some slight problems involved. I have had Snapchat since 2018 and I love alot of the new filters in the app, some make it worse. Like the camera view is alot smaller then I'm use to, both top and bottom has a black tint to it, it's not your average ""full screen"" anymore. When someone blocks you it does not show at all, use to be their snap score would go away and that's how you'd be blocked. Needs fixing!!",1
"I am also facing a problem in this app, actually when I upload a song on a video, it uploads songs on photo or video just 10 seconds, this is the biggest problem I am facing.",1
"It's been a handy app for keeping up with friends and family for video sharing. Special friends that don't share phone numbers, too. The biggest complaint besides the continuous bombardment of suggestions on quick ad is the forced in your face, My AI. This no choice cash grab to get rid of it has me on the fence about leaving the app. Especially since the update, put it on the chat page and is pinned and can't be removed.",1
"can you please help me, For some reason random people have been showing up on my friends post section even though they are not added by me and when I press don't recommend they literally show up in my chat section even though they were never added and it's creeping me out and I can't really",1
"Ok, so I was customising my AI Character when I noticed that some of the options were weird/unusual colors. Like some of the avatars that the glasses are on are completely black not allowing you to see the glasses. Now I have been using Snapchat since 2021 and have never had this problem. Also quite often I will go onto my friends story's but then it will emedietly take me back to the picture screen and have a notification that says ""My AI is already your friend!"" I find it very annoying.",1
"Hlo snapchat team, I am facing a problem my snapchat is not working and I can't even send a single text to my friends because it takes to much time to deliver a message.Also, I lost my snapchat streak with my friends and restore option is not available.Please help me to solve my problem as soon as possible.",1
I have had the app for a while but now its not letting me actually send or receive messages or snaps. I get the notifications but don't get anything until I get away from my current school but it worked 2 days ago.,1
"For me, snapchat is only for clicking picture I'm not using this app for messaging or other stuff. Snapchat filters are nice but sometimes idk why b the app automatically show error and sometimes it also automatically delete my pictures.",1
"Overall, it's an okay app. I don't like the newer updates at all. The 3D bitomojis really throws me off. I've never used the app to really communicate just because I can't screenshot anything without it telling the person. Some situations I understand why that's there, but it's quite annoying sometimes. I use the app for streaks and nothing else, really. It's not too bad of an app. I don't like the new Snapchat+ thing, though.",1
Used to use Snapchat for everything but the new update keeps glitching and not letting me see memories. Scary thought that everything I have saved on here could disappear with a glitch.,1
Please provide me 0.6x feature! It is only available to me for 1 week I want it back any how. I'm using Snapchat since last 3 year and why you guys only provide ultra wide feature to the iPhone user we Android users also deserves ultra wide feature! I'm using Samsung s21 it also has ultra wide camera but I can't use it on snapchat. If I have the compatible devices then you should have to provide ultra wide option on snapchat...,1
"I love the new ai!! But yall should definitely make it free to change there bio and description of how they act. Not everyone can afford these things and it makes less fun to chat with ai. We would love it if you added features to the ai like being able to call them and they speak back with a voice or something, I would definitely give 5 stars then, also make it where we can send videos and they can respond, I would love it if was like speaking to a real person!!!",1
"The notifications wont stop and if i turn it off i wont be notified about the msges and if i turn it on, i get notified about a random Bob who joined snapchat. Maybe there is an option to stop but i just don t know how to. And the app goes to camera first which again is unnecessary. My one and only goal is communication, so this app is not really for me. Hope this helps....",1
"When using a filter and you are lipsinging a long to a song, the song goes faster than the movement of the lips .. it doesn't make videos nice and good to even post it",1
"Please add more songs in the snapchat. There are only the latest song. But there should also be the song which are very good not only that songs which are latest or popular. So, please make the snapchat songs library vast. It will be very helpful to make more snaps. Otherwise, the app is very good.",1
"It's an excellent app, i have no issues with it. For me though, the AI inclusion is the best part of it , And the fact that it can interact with you in any language. Weldone snapchat, but I don't think the new bitmoji designs are good..",1
"I give Snapchat an overall 3 star rating because since the recent update, Everytime I open my Snapchat app to try and go use it .... It either takes forever to load or it acts like it's working right and as soon as I go to either check my snaps, add to my story, or look at my snap memories/snap stories it doesn't do anything.... All it says is Snapchat is NOT responding close or wait . PLEASE FIX THE FREAKING PROBLEM YOU HAVE CAUSED ASAP!!!!!",1
"I don't really care to be notified when someone reacts to my message. Is there any way to turn that notification off? I am also not a fan of the 3d bitmojis. I honestly feel they are over-exagerated. I enjoy the 2d bimojis much better. And I don't like how I can only get rid of MyAIFriend if I pay for a subscription. I don't need the AIFriend, and I don't like seeing it at the top of my chats indefinitely. And not sure if it's a phone issue, but every time I open snapchat, my Spotify stops.",1
Memory's - everytime I upload a memory from Snapchat from years ago. Normally it would go on your story and say in the top left - 3 years ago. Etc. Now it just says 2 mins ago even though it's from yearsss ago! Please change this :(,1
If they would get the camera to autofocus and come in clear that would be great. It looks so grainy and doesnt focus.,1
"It's good I'm happy I can chat with my friends but what have you done to the bitmojis? I don't like the new bitmojis but other than that, can you allow videos to be more than 120 seconds long? How is a 3 minute video for example something I can't send because ""videos more than 120 seconds cannot be sent"" and another thing every time I try and open the Snapchat app it says ""unfortunately snapchat is not working"" why?? Please fix this bug!",1
"It's good apart from it basically freezing not allowing me to open anything or press buttons, I have to close the app and keep doing it until it works.",1
This app is really nice but when I get notifications my phone on and it won't off can't you just not make the phone on because every morning when I use the phone I would always see it on even if I didint on it and I already know it's the notification so can you fix this pls,1
I use this app daily .. This is my fav app but something need to be fix first the Al should be in the option of remove myAl ... Secondly i want Snapchat games back put more interesting games there like I missed snake squad the most .,1
"Your ads every 10 seconds, when viewing videos, are annoying as hell. Thank God for youtube.",1
"When talking to AI, the pre-written questions at the bottom don't always send as displayed. For example, if you're talking about the Civil War and are later talking about something else, when you click a pre-filled question about the current topic, a question about the Civil War will come up instead. Not every single time, but maybe about 50% or 60% of the time.",1
It kicks me out when I'm trying to take a picture or when I'm viewing stories and also when I'm viewing snaps and won't let me chat in the group I made. I haven't got removed.,1
"It stuck and not working properly even after updating it . Even after updating it , it's not showing the messages and snaps my friends sent to me .",1
I've used this app for quite a while. It's one of the top apps I use for communication. That's what it was meant for. We don't have to modernize everything. I wish we had a choice in the new features like the AI chat bot. I hate it. I hate that I can't remove it without having to pay for the membership. We already have so much access to hundreds of AI's. It's unnecessary. I don't even want to start in the Bitmoji problem. All in all I just wish you could give us a choice.,1
I had a nice experience though i want an option in snap which can help to unsave all the chats saved by other person at just one click .,1
Why did you stop the multiple snap? That was my favorite unique thing I loved about snapchat. Now when I take a selfie I have to save then go back take another selfie and repeat. Kindly bring the multiple snap shot tab back. It was soooo convenient for us snap/selfie lovers,1
It was very very good but now I don't know what happened to it😫it's not working no ...I can't open snaps can't send and even can't download my snaps 😫... my 3 year images are there my memories my everything...kindly make it bug free whatever error is there😫,1
"I just wanna say that snapchat has updated the bitmojis so much, and they keep getting worse and worse. They do not need to keep making changes to them because they looked fine before. They need to just take them back to how they used to be.",1
"Plz change Bitmojis back to 2D. I used to use them often and now I use them never cuz they look like nightmare abominations. Other than that, it's aight. I enjoy snapping and chatting with my friends and loved ones and enemies.",1
"Loved it but hate it every update. The new font is ugly and makes reading messages harder, and the bitmojis keep getting uglier every update, and I can't take it, I might just turn my bitmoji off it's so bad.",1
"App has been good, but the recent change to the following is atrocious. Until it changes back to an easier to see format 1 star. I won't change it for any other reason.",1
Chat Stickers are not opening. My phone's network and everything is fine even I have updated the software and snapchat app as well still it is not working.,1
"After the new update, where samsung phones have updated 3d bitmoji and dark mode, etc... The font for the app has changed and it's horrible please revert it back!!!",1
"Honestly this is really nice app But after I updated my snap it's being acting weird.....so much lagging and something I can't give go through my picture. And adlo my phone has be lagging a lot, a lot of battery snap is taking.",1
"There is a problem in Snapchat ID after updating it from play store. The problem is that when I send a snap to any friend, the message is not going.",1
"Why are the filters that were previously among the favorites not finded?(Only when I remove the new filters from my favorites, those filters come up!) What is the solution? Is there a limit to the number of favorite filters?",1
Enjoy for the most part but I keep getting story notifications from a person I don't know. Support cannot give me any help in blocking this person or stopping the notifications from her.,1
"Having an issue. When screen sharing, audio is not also shared. A fix would be amazing!",1
Almost positive you're adding random people to my followers list at this point. Need a setting that automatically removes people who unfriend me first. I DO NOT want the premium. I already watch the ads. Stop tryna money grab off me,1
The app has messed up so much with the calling it would hangup the phone when not me or the other person would touch it it hangs up randomly and I need that fixed I don't want to keep having this issue,1
I gave only three stars to Snapchat because it have a lack of notification and floating notification and call or missed call it ain't show sounds or floating notifications even when im allowed it it doesn't had sound or show on lock screen,1
"My snap is not working, not able to send snap or message, what's this..also My flashlight is not working at all..I have reinstalled it 2 times...kindly fix the issue.",1
Great app but if use for a long time it will become slow and they are too many adds in between the stories overall if these issues are solved it is a great app👍🏻,1
"It would be actually good if you just had like one pop-up ad per 5 minutes (unless you were recording) but having Snapchat+ is basically useless plus forced 3D avatars make it 100x worse, like couldn't there be a button to switch back to 2D?",1
I am using this app since 3 years but since last year I am not getting notification i checked ify phone was glitching but in settings notification was turned on and in snap also notification was turned on but still I am not getting my answer,1
"This app is pretty good if not a little tedious to constantly check, but the interface feels really really out dated for some reason, I think it could use a revamp. Am I the only one who thinks this?",1
"Campared to my phone camera(16 mp) in Snapchat photo clarity wad very very worst 😒 and i take a photo means i want to save a photo in all time( for this reason only I can't take more photos in less time) ,add a features save a photo automatically .",1
This is a cool app. But since yesterday Im not being able back up and send my snaps to anyone. I have started facing this after updating the app. I hope this might be clarified. It's really nerve wrecking.,1
Glitches too much. Issues with loading and uploading with or without internet. Filters won't work properly.,1
GOOD APP,1
गंगासागर,1
"My account was hacked and the hacker violated the community guidelines. I tried to change my password and login but it said my account was locked for violating the community guidelines for drug content I didn't do. I also have a device ban for snapchat and I don't appreciate being screwed by this situation. Other than that, I've always loved snapchat and it really bugs me this is taking place.",1
nice,1
"Nice app, but randomly videos won't play all the way through with no clear way to fix it.",1
is favorable,1
i would be able to tell u about it but the app wil not load,1
"Way to glichy and slow to load, but i still love taking pictures on it!",1
Make wide angle smooth for galaxy ultra series just like in iPhone camera,1
ss03 pis,1
If I send some one video the photo size change automatically and make a hug sape and if I talk some his/him bitmoji disappear 😔,1
It kicks me out when I'm trying to take a picture or when I'm viewing stories and also when I'm viewing snaps and won't let me chat in the group I made. I haven't got removed.,1
glitchy all the time,1
Why is this showing 69.69 mb?,1
it's a very good app. you can create interesting snaps on any topic,1
"Actually I am using this app from last 2 year, but from 2024 I started facing some problem like : I have good internet connection but spotlight is not working and : suddenly the spotlight is end and not scrolling any more after updating also the problem didn't solve that's why I am rating the app only 3 star and : I request the management to take the problem seriously otherwise they lost there user's .......",1

"The app has been glitching recently. All of my spotlights have been deemed ""limited view"" due to ""abusive language"" when there is none at all AND all of my videos are posting twice. Customer service is nonexistent. Other than the app being ran by robots who can't help me .. I like it lol",1

"Indian music is not finding esiliye Take photos in very small size,",1
There are few reasons for which I don't use Snapchat. 1. For its annoying notifications 2. I don't want to update everyone about what I am doing for every time. 3. It's video recommendations system is very bad.,1
I like the idea 💡 and ways to create an avatar!!! 100% SECURE AND EASY TO USE THE APP KEEP UP ON THE WORK?❤️ 😍,1
Bad serves,1
Not bad but wish ss notifications weren't a thing there really annoying,1
This app is good but for the restoration of the streaks is done by paying it's cost,1
Its some how cool but some filter are not working well that's why I gave you people 3 🌟 so get on and fix it already,1

This app is very good but please launch Snapchat lite as soon as possible. THANKYOU,1
I have noticed over the last 6 months or so that when viewing a friend's story it's all current when I know some are memories. It used to say memory in the top left but now it only shows the hour it was shared instead. Why??,1
hate the AI feature at top of friend list. used to be able to remove. also hate seeing random people story suggestions. I only want to view my friends stuff. wish I could turn these off,1
It was alright but not much to do,1

"It was cool in the beginning the all the subscriptionstuff will pop up and it gets annoying. Then theres my chats where i cant no longer save photos to my camera roll from chat. I unistalled the app, reinstalled it, cleared cliche, cleared data, restarted my phone and it just wont do. I have no answers.",1
Good,1
"Okay ig,The bad side is that when you use this app on your computer it ownt load atleast for me it wont.Ive been sitting on the main screen for 30 minutes now and it wont move at all even after ive resized the screen and done everything please fix this.",1
Temperature sticker defaults to fahrenheit after you post stories even though you apply it to the snap as Celsius. I like Snapchat to stay in touch with my friends across the world and I like posting the current temperature to remind them that I live in a cold place and I'm jealous of their sunshine.,1
Oh! Nice,1
"Fine but got locked. I got locked in for my friend's sexual side and decided to lock both accounts on my phone, including mine and I have been inactive for nearly a year now. Can I get some help?",1

i can't share my screen while I'm in a call because I have a samsung it's only available on iOS and snapchat should make Samsung to have the ability to share screen while in a call,1

DISABLE subtitles as default setting. They automatically turn on every channel you watch or if you skip ads. Yellow progress bar is useless. If I back out or don't finish something it makes you start over some times? And if I've seen the same episode of anything before DON'T show it as new/suggested/unseen. How doesn't the app know if I've watched something or not. And why do I need to refresh the app to tell it I just finished watching something? Borderline spam filtering.,1
No proper and helpful support when required,1

"Zoom function has become unusable! giving a review so I can shed light on a recent issue regarding camera zoom. Lately the zoom function will zoom in too much too quickly, and if I try to counteract that by zooming back out, same scenario except in reverse. It's maddening when taking a video and basically unusable! I am currently on a Galaxy S24, and I've read of pixel users experiencing the same issue. FIX THIS!!!",2
"The only things I don't like are that you can't get rid of the ai chat bot without paying. I don't think that's fair! Also, I wish that snapchat spotlight was optional...I really don't need another short video platform in my life. Lastly, I really don't like the updated bitmojis... I liked the cartoony look. The bitmojis looked better overall before the update. That is another thing that I wish was optional. However, these cons don't affect your overall experience :)",2
"It's a must-have nowadays. The problem is the amount of sexual scam bots on it. Oftentimes I will get randomly added, and one time it sent me a rather explicit video. However this is all avoidable by using their privacy options. There are also A LOT of ads when viewings stories and spotlights and it's always the same ad. The built in games are meh",2
"I think Snapchat should let us customize our bitmoji more accurately.... Like by being able to adjust the size of every body part like thighs, leg length, etc. they should also add more hair styles/make them look more realistic. The hair colors should be customizable. The Ai also tracks your location even though it claims it doesn't... and doesn't help anyone. Otherwise, great and fun app. BRING BACK MINI GAMES",2
"Can we get rid of, or make it an option to auto open stories if I press the story button on the bottom. I just want to navigate to that page, not automatically pull up people's stories. And this new scrolling down story view is really annoying. Stop changing things we like, or make it an option in settings at least. It was fine the way it was.",2
"The only app I call my friends on, has a lot of fun features and stuff. But PLEASE do something where you can change the music for the ringtone, I have special ringtones on my calling app, but no one ever calls me there so I don't get to have fun or express myself with the audio. I think it would be really cool if users could put their own ringtone for the calling. Thanks!",2
"Love the filters, have such fun with them... (And I am Gen X?!). But... Wish there were more options like saving messages (all the time, not just sometimes), wish the spotlight videos could be paused (like TikTok) or at least muted cuz when I want to add or read through the comments, it is sooo distracting... wish that the screen wouldn't switch over so easily when writing a txt message.... Etc.",2
"Snap is a really good app and it is a really good way to chat and connect with friends it helps a lot with communicating. WAY too many ads but if I was just to say it was perfect it would be lying it has its weaknesses and strengths, I would love to see more updates in the future regarding Ads or ways to get rid of sirtan notifications like Chad is typing ect.",2
"Honestly I've had a pretty good experience with this app throughout the years and I don't really get the problem with most people giving it low reveries, sure they have their own devices and have issues which some devices don't, but really it's not all that bad, but I'll be honest myself some features need improvement and some need to be added, The camera for me has crazy lag on filters, They also need to add the dark mode which is strangely limited to IOS users only.",2
"It's a good app, but for me, it seems more toward the apple brands. Personally I have a Samsung, and I seem to have more issues with the app then people who have an apple product. My videos sometimes skip, so part of the video is missing, and the filters sometimes glitch out where they won't appear. Please work on the android part of this app as well, because there are many bugs that could be fixed. But other then that, I think it's a great app, and is really nice for keeping in contact with my friends.",2
"Using on Android, Samsung S9+. Good for sharing those short moments you know your friends would appreciate but you don't want to keep in your phone's memory. However, please remove that terrible new ""New Friends' Stories"" bubble that blocks my private feed. I am perfectly capable of checking my friends' stories when I want to, thank you very much. Also, improve the method of picture taking on Android. Not everyone has kidneys to spare for a hunk of metal masquerading as a fruit (or the patience for its OS and planned obsolescence). I have a camera I can use, shoddy screen grabs aren't pictures I would like to share.",2
"I've found a bug today, it happens when i talk to a certain person for about 10 minutes or less and then it bugs out, nothing will load or say that it has sent something, and when i try to go into another chat, it wont load. The only way I can really ""fix"" this is by restarting my phone. If you can contact me and resolve this, it'd be nice. Thank you :)",2
"I have always loved this app for talking to people and never really had issues with it. However, for the last month and a half, I do not receive any notifications. And I know that it's not my phone (galaxy s20+). I have tried restarting my phone, deleting/redownloading snap, changing all my settings, and still nothing. There have been many updates, but none to fix this and it's getting very frustrating. Please fix it.",2
My only suggestion is to allow the direct messages to save to the account inbox until the user deletes them. I have to save screenshots of important messages to my phone so I do not lose the information. I would much rather store my messages in the app where I received them and do not like it at all that everything is wiped out by the app after 24 hours. FRUSTRATING and I also have lost some pictures that I would have loved to have kept but were also cleared by the app. Please consider changes.,2
"I really like Snapchat and the updates because I love the animated stickers. But for some reason despite my app being up to date, it won't let me continue recording. It will only let me record for a couple of seconds. Unlike the older update where I could record for longer times. That's the main thing that bugs me. ( Recent edit ) okay now this app is making my phone crash and reset on its own. Becoming slowly more disappointed with this app.",2
"I've had this app for a long time and for about the last 6 months I've been having nothing but issues. Parts of the snap discover stories don't load, I often can't send snaps to people because it says cannot send. I have never had any issues with my wifi or phone. I have a note 8 that runs everything else on it smoothly. However I'm getting super tired of these bugs and if this isn't fixed soon, I will be closing my account.",2
"The app is very easy to use and a very creative idea. It is the main social application to interact with friends. However, I have a Samsung and some of the features my friends and colleagues have I am lacking. For example, I cannot ""pin"" people to the top of my chats, and I do not have the filter that shows the streak I have with someone. Overall it's a great app, and I highly recommend!",2
"There is a bug that is driving me insane!!! Every time I open the app or try to open my camera or chats or basically anything, the quick add friends menu keeps coming up. It's constant. I'll be trying to send a snap and the add friends menu comes up. It happens so quick that when I tap to start recording or chat or take a picture, I accidentally add random people. Super annoying. I keep having to block random people I do not want to add. I already submitted feedback in the app days ago.",2
"Pretty good app for communication, exploration and networking. Group chat, video chat, voice chat and in between it's a great app. Two things hold me back from the 5star though. One is lack of customization, snap makes it very difficult to change app sounds and notifications. Wish there was a little more freedom. In addition the discover part of the app is very commercial and can't be turned off. It's a major time sink I wish wasn't there. Overall though it keeps the ads restricted to that sect",2
"I love the app, although I have one big problem I can think of. When I am in a call with someone, I have 95% access to my phone, other than the rest of snapchat. If I swipe or back out of the chat I'm currently in a call with, it ends the call abruptly. I'd like to be able to do things on the outside of the chat such as text others, as example. That is really it, thanks for the rest of the experience",2
"Sometimes the times suddenly get mixed up. For instance I'm texting someone at 2:00 pm, I pull the message to see the time and it says that a message I sent two seconds ago was sent at 6:30 pm or something like that. Also, sometimes the person I'm texting will send a message but it disappears a second after it pops up in the chat. It only seems to be happening on my screen and not theirs.",2
"It's a awesome app! I love the app, I'm on it 24/7. I like how when you get a message it tells you, it tells you when they're typing, and when your away from your phone it lights up when you have a message! You can post on your story and let friends see it, change your friends nicknames, call, text, send stickers, and everything. But theres only 1 thing I dont like. Some of the features seem to only be on iPhone. Like the color update. That would be better if it was on all phones :(",2
"I love snapchat, I've had it and loved it for years. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I've been having issues with the filters working, and when looking through saved memories, I hit save one time and there are multiples of many, copies of my videos are shorter, some are split up into 2 or 3 videos. The split videos when I select one video to delete (bc it's a multiple) it selects both/all that would have made the original video. One one video, the text I had made small is big.",2
I've had this app for a long time now and have been pretty happy with it overall. I have noticed lately that I have to wait a minute or so between sending snaps or it won't capture a video. Have also had several issues with snaps not being sent or not loading properly or snap showing up as black on my story and having to delete them later. Don't know if this is just a problem with my phone because I have recently updated the app. Hopefully these glitches can be fixed because I absolutely love it,2
"I'm not sure as to whether it's my own phone or if it's the app, but when I try to take pictures of sometbing zoomed in, when the picture lets me edit, it shows the picture as if I had taken it without zooming in. Like I said, I'm not sure if it's my own phone or the app, but I would like that fixed. My phones normal camera works just fine. I also want to see if an auto tune voice filter can be added with the alien, chipmunck, bear and robot filters are.",2
"Great app, although the filters are not working correctly. I had on the dog filter and nothing popped up. As I retried it wouldn't work. I deleted then downloaded. Still, wouldnt work. I then got my brother to help me. He couldn't get it to work. Please help me. Other things too! Such as my snapmap. I have location on but it will not show anyone. Overall, its a pretty secure app. I'd reccomend to 13 and up.",2
"Snapchat is an amazing app to respond and socialize with friends, even when they are far away! The app has everything. Such as the stories feature, the 'tiktoks', pictures, filters, and even a map. But, I really despise the AI bot. It is kind of disturbing and weird. Recently, it posted a story on its page, which is absurd for it to happen. Honestly, Snapchat should just make it an option to have it 😊🥰.",2
"I've been using this app for AGES. My main complaint is the lagging for Androids. Also, the lack of features for Android is bothersome. Is it that hard to offer dark mode for all phone types? It takes a second to actually take the picture, and by the time you take it, (if you're taking a picture of a moving object), it'll be gone. I suggest fixing that!",2
"Overall, good app - fun to use. Until the latest update, my Snapchat had been working well. Suddenly, I can't look at messages sent to me, can't update my story and can't send messages. I'm so frustrated with this update. I came to the play store to see if I could get another update to fix the issues or return to a previous version. No dice. Also, very tired of having to hide, then rehide things in discovery that I'm not interested in and I'm told will not appear in my suggestions again.",2
"Sometimes it can be Aggravating.. uploading some of your fav memories can be a hassle. Either out of order or a long process. The music section is limited. customizing a clip can be a waste because it doesn't upload. overall it's pretty st8 forward. For a creator, I feel it handicaps. But nothing is perfect. I am going to keep rocking with them. Because the ppl who are Developers have a hard job. 😊😊",2
"I just have a quick thought. Some people dont allow their children to have snapchat because of the message and story features. Perhaps it would be reasonable to create an app with just filters and photo editing features for those people who miss out on the app completely. The only thing that wouldn't be on it would be the public stuff. It's more along the lines of a less-advanced, child-friendly app.",2
"I don't know if this is just my phone or if it was apart of the update. But when I get a notification, my phone buzzes like 3 times. It's extremely annoying. It also makes an extra sound whenever it's trying to send a notification and has an upload icon in the notifications bar when sending. The one vibration per notification was more than enough. It was clean and efficient. This is just a mess.",2
"It is an amazing app ! I only have one complaint, its the stupid black bar it is in the way and takes up a lot of screen space so please fix it. You can chat with your friends, there ate ever changing filters to use that are so cute if i may add, you can post on your story, you can snap your friends back and forth, you can swipe left from the filter page and scroll through all of you amazing friend's stories and its all happens in one awaome app. I would highly recommend installing this app!",2
"I like the filters, there are always new ones coming out! Now you can also search for ones you liked in the past 🙂. On the filter games sometimes you can not push the bottom options though because home buttons get in the way on my phone, I looked for a way to fix the issue but haven't found a solution :(. Still a good app to chat with friends and send pictures and videos 😃.",2
I really like snapchat. The only few issues I have with the app is that when I video call any of my friends the call glitches terribly and my phone will start to heat up. Then it crashes on me so I have to result to going on messenger to video call friends. What I also don't like is when I'm in a call and when I try to multitask it ends the call. Other than those 2 issues I love the app. Its addicting and great for messaging. The filters are fun and cute. Reading the stories are a great time killer as well. Would recommend only if those issues were solved.,2
"To be honest, it's pretty good. Sometimes here and there, it lags and then the whole app just closes. It's okay though, cause I just reopen it. The one thing I don't like, is when your skipping through, and you go to your map on accident... Or when you take photos and it lags, and you think you got the photos, but then you don't and it's blurry and you gotta retake it. Other then that, it's great! Well organized, and I really love using the app!",2
"it's a good app I've used it for a few years now. the only problem I really have with it is that sometimes if a message doesn't send it'll just say ""waiting to send"" then never send. another problem is that if i send a snap then switch to another app without it fully sending it can sometimes either not send or just delete the snap. if these were fixed it would be great but im not going to stop using it because of these flaws. over all still a great app",2
"I find the app fun and intresting, as a text app or just for fun with filters. I only have one problem. Everything has seemed to have worked for over a year or so, but some reason out of the blue I cant open stories. I can't even open my own story. I have tryed looking for updates, clearing app data, resarting my phone, and even reinstalling the app, but nothing is working.",2
"I always enjoy having this app for the filters, but I have a problem that constantly requires me to delete and redownload the app. I would try every once in a while to upload a funny video saved to my phone to my story, but it'll freeze up on me and won't upload it, nor allow me to upload anything else to my story until I delete and re-download the app. Could you fix this? Other than that, great app :))",2
"Love snapchat! Been using it for a long time! I've recommended it to a lot of people, got them to download it. Don't like that when you read messages and leave the chat, they delete automatically. You can set it to last up to 24 hours, but sometimes I would like to keep them permanent or a lot longer, same goes pictures you send to each other. Love filters, but sometimes snapchat will replace them and it's so hard to find them again",2
"I love this app for many reasons. However, I have been very frustrated lately about something. When I modify a video using the app it never saves correctly. It always distorts something. Whether it stretches the entire picture, flips it, leaves out certain modifications. Very frustrating. I hope it is fixed. I will be looking forward to it. Thanks Snapchat developers! You guys are great!",2
"I love the app, but this last update has some issues. The biggest one to me is that I'm getting a double vibration for every notification and I don't think that's something I can change on my phone, so please either change that back to the single vibration or make it possible to customize. The app is also getting a bit slow in launching sometimes and opening snaps is slower. I don't have many big issues with this update to mention, but please change/fix these couple things.",2
"We should be able to change our username (at LEAST once a month if not all the time like on Instagram). Besides that, it does lag a lot and sometimes the app closes randomly but it's not that bad. The quality is okay, but it could be better. It would be helpful if the app would run smoother and the call button weren't right above the keyboard.",2
"It is a very Good setup and eveeything is easily accessible as well, as organized. I really enjoyed this app. I have been using Snapchat for about 4 years and never had a problem with it. However, since the new updates, i can say that calling someone on snapchat, makes the App crash a lot or whenever you video call someone if your internet isnt Super strong it goes all pixelated and blurring.",2
"This is a fun way to make pictures and use filters for fun pics of you, your friends, even your pets! You can do different backgrounds and AR, and even make your own filters. I've used the chat sometimes, but doesn't save your previous chats or pictures unless you tell it to. I wish that the filters you save could be found more easily or compiled into more streamlined categories or something, and that some of the old filters like face swap were still available. I have a lot of fun w/this app!",2
"I personally love this app because it gives you all you need in one. You can FaceTime, Text, Call etc.... All your friends can add you and you can even meet new people and find people to hang around in your area! 😁 Only thing wrong with it is sometimes it will kick me off of the app while I'm in use of it or when I'm trying to snap someone the screen will turn black instead of showing up my picture. Kinda sad but it doesn't hold back on the good times and memories it beholds 😔😊",2
"Overall, I enjoy the app. Sometimes the app will crash, or I'll accidentally back out of the app while creating a snap, and I lose my snap masterpiece. Though not often, it's often enough to be a little annoying. It seems it has improved since I first started using it, so hopefully they've been working on those bugs. Aside from that, I enjoy the filters and messaging capabilities with all the Bitmoji options. Security and privacy settings have improved, which I love. Would recommend.",2
"Snapchat is really useful and good for talking to friends. My only issue is that Androids and iPhones have different features per phone. No matter what phone you have, you should be able to do the same things as the other and vice versa. Other than that, snap is a nice and easy way to make and talk to friends! (Also add more slightly wavy medium length hair styles!!)",2
"This app is pretty good, you can keep in touch with friends and family and have a blast while doing it! Right now the only thing wrong with it, for me at least, is that I can't send bitmojis with other friends in the sticker, after the latest update it hasn't let me and I haven't been able to fix it. I uninstalled the app, reinstalled it, double checked that it's completely updated, tried snapchatting people in different ways to see how I could get it to appear, etc... none of that's worked.",2
"I've always enjoyed this app, it's simple, fun & is my preferred method of socializing with friends. BUT I've been having tons of issues since it updated on Sept 4th. Issues such as: opening Snapchat & nothing will load, just spins & I'll have to close out & reopen the app; try to send a snap, chat/video/photo, & no friends, groups or my story show up to ""send"" to & once again have to close out of the app & reopen it, mutiple times in some cases. Please fix ASAP so I can get back to snapping!!!",2
"I do enjoy Snapchat, however, Since the last update i have had issues with it saying connection fail. Unable to connect. But all my other apps, including facebook and Instagram are not having trouble. And also, it isn't consistent. Sometimes it gives me other issues and sometimes it does not. But then i usually have an update available. This issue has been going on since the latest update on November 20th.",2
"For the most part, it is great. I rate 4 stars because an app this popular should be able to have updates available for both Android and Apple products in the same time frame. I have a Google pixel 2 (Android) and I feel that this app always has a delay for updates compared to apple and my phone is very fast!. Please fix this issue!!",2
The app itself is amazing. It spend most of my time on Snapchat just texting my friends instead of using the default text app. Although I have been experienceing problems with typing when I send streaks or adding text to my story. It has been a huge problem for me for the last 3 months and because of that I kept losing streaks. Whenever I try to type a message on my streaks and story the app will just close out. I really hope the developers can fix this bug I have been dealing with. But otherwise the app is just great.,2
"Updating review: 2 to 4 stars. (Pixel 3 XL w/ Android Pi) I'm not sure if it was a Snapchat update, an Android update, or both that fixed Snapchat, but it works much better! The issues of immense lag, constant crashing, and shifting of drawings, stickers, and text are gone! Snapchat is finally usable again. However, the volume button doesn't work for me, especially when watching videos in saved conversations. And the app still occasionally resets, deleting any snap or message i was working on.",2
"Doesn't give an option to deleted ""failed to send"" messages or snaps, and if there's one ""waiting to send"" you can no longer see if you newest snap has gone through or if it's been opened. Other than that, it's really amazing for keeping in contact with everyone in your life, including people very far away. It makes it easy to have group calls out of th country for free and I love being able to do that. I highly recommend this app, but would like the above statements fixed.",2
"I love snapchat to the maximum, but I would really like to see somw improvements on the video and audio calls. A friend and I were talking about how it can get annoying when you cant snapchat anyone else while on the call, or it will kick us out of the call. I really appreciate being able to go into other apps and such, but it can get a little frustrating when you're on a 3 hour call and if hangs up because someone accidentally hit someone's snap notification. That's about it.",2
"Great service, fun app. Would like to see a few improvements such as an auto save option any pictures or videos sent to ""My Story"" or even regular messaging. The other improvement I would like to see; instead of having only delete after viewing and after twenty four hours, I would like a never delete option. Some people I can only reach through this app and it can be frustrating saving every message. Fantastic app though. Keep it up team.",2
I love Snapchat. It's my main communication source. However. I have the Google pixel 3 and I have this constant glitch where I'll be taking a normal picture and if I delete it to retake it the camera zooms in all the way. It doesn't happen all the time but it's enough to be frustrating. Sometimes just quitting out of the app fixes it. Sometimes I have to turn off my whole phone. In some cases I have to delete and reinstall the app. (Currently what I'm doing). It's incredibly frustrating.,2
"I love this app, helps me keep up with and keep memories. But lately it hasn't been keeping the filters I put on them; it'll go on there and then as soon as I send it or post the filters are gone. Its getting annoying considering I like putting the location filter to keep track of where I've been. Been happening for a few months and I had hoped with the new update it would be fixed, but it hasn't.",2
"I have tried to submit a geofilter 3 times now. I made changes. It kept getting rejected. I read the criteria and couldn't tell what the issues was. I get the same generic response each time and it was beyond annoying and frustration. Had to find a Google article and finally discovered what I assumed was the issue (I wasn't close enough to location/was still out of state). Once I arrived and retried it, the purchase went through immediately",2
"really great app. But for some reason, the last few months, my snapchat would crash, and would not open and all it is saying is that Snapchat had an error, and everytime i open it afterwards, it just keeps doing it, so i would have to go and clear all of the data in the app and sign back in, and then later on, the same thing happens. Please look into this. Its very frusterating",2
"Of course, snapchat is just the fun little basic filter app that every teen has. I like that you can save your snaps and the scanning options. Lately, the app has been freezing and it's become very annoying. When I browse through the different filters, it freezes. It is extremely unpleasant and upsetting, especially for a widely popular app that almost everyone uses. I hope that this will get fixed soon.",2
"It's a nice app but recently I noticed something weird. I can't delete a conversation. so I tried to send the same story to a bunch of people but everytime I did so, it failed. now it sits at the top of my conversation list and I can't seem to get rid of it. It's really annoying cause it occupied three slots and neither can I resend cause the retrys fail as well nor can I delete it. help!",2
"I love the app but I just wish it'd be more compatible with androids. I know developing two versions of an app for two very different phones is complicated, but sometimes my camera on snap doesn't work. Also after a few months I have to reinstall because I stop getting notifications. I don't have these issues with any other app, on top of the battery it takes can get insane. I wish there was also an option to just never delete messages if you text someone often.",2
Part of the time the story's don't show up until about 15 minutes after they posted. Also when I tap on the snap to open it it shows up black and I try again and it's still black so I never get to see that snap. I still can't take a video with a filter even though it says your working on it and my videos can only last going around the circle once. It's very frustrating,2
"One of my favorite social media apps! BUT I am begging yall to put in a feature where I can delete memories when they come up from a year ago or three years ago or whatever. This would help me SO MUCH to downsize the sheer amount of photos I have saved to my memories, as I could do it bit by bit as they come up instead of doing it all at once, which makes the decisions and process a lot more difficult. You have no idea how many times I've wished for this feature. I implore you.... pleeaaseee...",2
"I love this app! I would give it 5 stars, but there is one problem I have encountered. Any time I take a photo or video and post it to my story, it lags like crazy and 90% of the time it freezes on me and I am unable to do anything. So I have to restart the app. It's like the server or whatever cant handle multiple photos or videos and it seizes out. Idk but it's frustrating. Other than that 10/10 for this app.",2
"Overall I do love this app, it has a pretty UI and once you figure out how to use it, it's very nice. However, I don't like how some things are unaccessible to me but people I know have them, such as recording with some filters and dark mode. I also recently had to reinstall the app because it kept saying that every single person on my friends list was recently added, causing me to have around 21 pings at all times.",2
it's a great app. but the flash isterrible. on iPhone the flash flashes twice and takes a better photo. it used to do this on my Samsung. but I updated it once last year and it had never been fixed. it shines the flashlight for about 4 seconds before it actually takes a picture. I've been putting up with it for months because i thought ya'll would fix it but I'm fed up.,2
"This app ran surprisingly well. No bugs or glitches of any kind on my phone. I've had it for a few weeks with a good experience, but i'm taking 1 star off due to the ads... while I understand that this is one of the ways Snapchat makes money, there are just far too many in my opinion. Honestly, I would be perfectly fine paying a subscription/fee to get an ad-free version, IF the price is right. Overall, good app with a nice UI, but a little too many ads for my liking.",2
"I love the app, it's great to talk to friends on and to mess with the filters. My only problem is around ever 20 seconds or so it sends me back to the homescreen. J could be browsing some of the community filters or texting/snapping a friend and it will send me back. Interrupting what I'm doing. I only am writing this so it can be fixed. Other than this I've had no problems with the app.",2
"Ive had snapchat for quite some time on my phone and it works out just fine, but using it on a computer/laptop is so confusing. It does not let you login at all when your on a laptop. ive tried deleting it then adding it back again but it just does not work. but overall its a good app to use to communicate with people, save and share all of that.",2
Really good app especially if you don't have your friends phone numbers. You can find anyone just by searching the name. You also have a little avatar that you can customize but I have had a little bit of trouble altering it after the 1st time. It's also kinda hard to block people you have been talking to because the option only pops up if they have been ignoring you. Overall a really good app tho,2
"Snapchat is nice and allows you to stay protected while using it. I do feel like it needs more hairstyles for people with split dye hair, and body shapes. Besides that it's very nice and helps you connect with your friends! Though, there are some things not good for kids.. Like bots trying to send inappropriate things or ask for your information. I do sometimes over rely on this app so just be careful about those things.",2
"Haven't had any issues as far as sending and receiving messages. I've deleted a couple of old accounts after clearing: conversations, locations, lens, search, etc and then deactivated them. However, I've noticed that the information that I used to sign in/up has remained when I log out; yes I have clicked, ""remove account"" after being asked at the log in screen. I have even deleted the app and reinstalled it with hopes of the emails/passwords being deleted.",2
"I love Snapchat but lately none of my messages will send on time and I'm not receiving snaps sent by friends at all. I'm not blocked and I haven't blocked anyone. Runs super slow and there's nothing wrong with my internet connection, it's running on excellent and I've done everything I could to speed it up but it remains the same. Other than the slowness I love the content and the quick and easy communication that comes with this setup.",2
Obviously love this app. However I am a former iPhone/IOS user and I used to love the ability to save multiple pictures/videos of my story all together in one save grouping. This feature is not available on Android. Instead you are only able to save one single video or picture at a time off of your story. If this feature was added to Android that would be greatly appreciated!,2
"Love the app, but please for the love of God remove the 3d bitmojis. I've heard many complaints from other people as well, no one seems to enjoy them. I loved the original bitmojis, so if you could refrain from replacing them that would be lovely. There are a few glitches in the app, and randomly when I'm texting the app will freeze and I'll miss many texts. Other than that this is an amazing app and I do reccomsnd it to anyone who doesn't have it. Thank you!",2
"I use Snapchat everyday and overall it's a good app, I don't seem to have many problems with it, but now my messages and snaps take so long to send if ever they do. It says ""waiting to send"" so it makes it hard for me to text someone when I can only respond like 3 or more hours later. It would be appreciated if you could fix the issues with sending messages. Thank you!",2
"Really useful, and rarely has any issues. However, I did have one major issue yesterday where I was apparently blocked by one of my friends, but they themselves didn't block me. Iirc it happened after I tried sending a gif message via Giphy keyboard add-on that failed to send several times due to bad connection, and after that it refused to send messages of any kind. Kind of a niche issue, but could you look into it?",2
"I gave this a 4 because, when I tried to add my contacts some would add but most would not. I checked they do exist and they also did not block me. I am annoyed that I can't add most of my family that is in my contacts,please fix this not just for me but for everyone who has this problem. Also just a few days ago I tried to snap for my STREAKS. The button would hold for a video and seem to snap a photo. But when I went to edit or post it wouldn't bring be to page where you do this. Please fix.",2
"I'd say Snapchat is a really awesome app with a lot of new things to offer, but recently idk what's been happening. Some of the posts on my story just won't load, the screen just randomly with go black, and it crashes a lot. Idk how to fix this but I tried to post something on my story like 10 hours ago (not joking) and it's still loading and trying to post. Again, idk how to fix it because you can't delete the picture while it's loading or anything sooooooooo yeah, that's what happened.",2
I would really love it if you could zoom in on stickers more. I make alot of streaks and would really enjoy it. I would also like to be able to place stickers over paint. I really like this app but alot of things could be fixed. Please fix these things. I also have a problem opening the app. It gliches really bad and says i have to try again. Please fix these issues.,2
"I like Snapchat, however. I've been having issues with some of the lenses. For example, the age progression lense no longer has the slider for me. I have to take a static photo, so I can not use the video option for that lense. I did not switch phones and I was able to use the slider previously. But all other features are there and I still enjoy the app. I'm able to connect with friends and see what's going on around the world. I do like Snapchat, I just want some lenses to actually work. 4/5",2
"this is a great app. ive used it for such a long time and enjoyed what it provided and updated since. but recently the stories have been kinda buggy. not sure if its just me or other have it too. and by stories i mean the discover one where when you read an article the rest of the article when you swipe up doesnt show up anymore. it stops. its weird, not a total big deal but it would be nice to read the entire article.",2
Snapchat has been great for video chatting with friends during this quarantine. One feature that would push me to a 5 star review is the ability to rotate the screen to landscape mode when in the app and especially video chatting. I have a plan to screen cast to my tv for a bigger monitor but the orientation is still in vertical or Portrait mode. Tried using an app to force Landscape mode but the Snapchat UI did not support it and seems to bug out. Thanks!,2
"Love the concept of the app, but I do want to mention this. I use a Google Pixel (4th gen) and this app causes my phone to crash and reboot fairly often. I have 40% battery right now, and everything else works fine. It's not the first time this has happened. I'd like you to look into why that is. This phone does have a weak battery, but it's consistently with your app that it crashes before the battery reaches critical levels as opposed to others. Good luck and best wishes.",2
"I've been using Snapchat for several years now, but lately it's started acting up. I get notifications for snaps, but when I open the app everything is frozen, now it will not even load. I wish they will work to fix these issues, not updating the format, not adding new font options, just fixing these bugs that make using the app impossible. I'll leave four stars since I enjoy this app, but three stars feels better considering the bugs and issues.",2
"i use snapchat daily, and i belive that it is a really great app. i know that there are definitely some flaws, like how long audio snaps have to load before you can open them, or how the app can be slow. i also have a problem with the snapmap. whenever i open the map, it freezes my whole screen and i have to exit the app and come back in. the app isn't all flaws though, and i enjoy snapping and talking to my friends on this social app. there are not many ads which i am grateful for.",2
"Snapchat is an app that easily allows you to communicate with your friends and allows you to connect with new people, but there are several features that seem to be harmful for the user experience, such as the ""Display your precise location"" feature and the addictive story feature that could also be harmful if you like to internet surf. Snapchat also has a bot issue, and they're not helpful at removing them, so if you download this app, expect a few inappropriate users to automatically add you.",2
"Over all I really like the app I can hangout with my friends and we can play games together, but I keep having troubles with the games we will be playing and people will get exited out and many times when I have had full bars of WiFi it told me I was disconnected. Sometimes it also changes my outfit which isn't a big deal but slightly annoying. So if you could please work on it that would be great but overall good app recommended 👍.",2
"I've loved this app from the beginning. however, i've been having problems with the new format on my samsung galaxy s9. the function of the app is fine, it's just i can't find where the friend emoji button is to change it, and a few things that i had on the app before are gone. also, it crashes every once in a while. but overall, good app",2
"The application is captivating. I can easily talk to my friends and family, and my most favourite my AI .Main reason I gave it ⅘ stars is my timeline experience. Whenever I make a video, it starts glitching. Like it may kick me out, or the video will disappear out of nowhere. And while adjusting the text duration, it starts glitching a lot. Then I have to save it and try every thing one-by-one which is very slow process. I request you to fix these bugs on your timeline feature.",2
"It's a great app to make new friends but a few changes I ask be done. when clearing a conversation, there should e an option for clearing all the conversations instead of manually picking each one and deleting it, saves a lot of time when you have a lot of contacts 2. there should be an option where we should manually decide whether we accept the request to be on a a group we've been added on because a lot of times, I've been added onto a random group with people I don't know. Thank you !",2
"This app is amazing, but it needs some touches. First of all, if i accidently tap off the keyboard, my entire comment resets and I have to rewrite the whole thing again. Secondly, there needs to be a pause button on the spotlights. But overall, the app is amazing and I recommend that you download it. Also some things you should bring back: •The old bitmojis •The mini games •The likes",2
I have had great experience with this app in the past years but recently I'm experience alot of trouble while using it. I was sending snaps with full internet connection but still it won't go reach my friends as a result I deleted the app and tried to reinstall but again even with proper internet connection it was not getting installed. I kept trying for hours and then finally it got installed after trying for the 10th time. Apart from this it's a great app,2
"The app is pretty good and I already have a bias for this app, seeing as I really don't like my phones default msg app. This app is simple, easy to use, and pretty fun to use. My only issue that thankfully hasn't been an issue for me yet is snapmaps, can be a huge invasion of privacy. But then again there is ""ghost mode"" so that's good. Occasional bugs, and support is amazing, lost my acc bout a year ago, and the people at snap helped me get it back with in 2 days",2
"its good it just needs more updates. (and not the ones where u guys make the avatars uglier each year. I like the idea of the app and ive been using it for years. I just want more Bitmoji options like streaks for hair,more piercing options like belly button piercings, and overall better clothing.",2
I like the app its very simple but the filters take extremely long to load when taking a picture also its so slow i have to go out of the app and back in at first i thought it was my WiFi connection but then i went towards it and its even slower also it takes insanely long to go into the chats or spotlight please try your best to fix this thank you !!,2
It can be laggy sometimes and takes long to update but other than that I think that this app is really good for phones and tablets. It really helps communicate better with friends. I would one hundred percent recommend this to other people. Its just a nice app to have even if you need it. It really is just amazing. I love it!!!,2

Good app. Love it but I'm making this review to say make the ai removable or at least not pinned to the top. It is not used by many so please fix this because sometimes I try clicking on a new snap or chat and click the AI and it gets annoying. And the AI doesn't even help with much anyway,2

"Snapchat is a fun place to be and helps you stay connected with your friends and sometimes family, there are rarely any ads unless you're watching reels or stories other than that you can skip past them. The ads are only 5-10 seconds long and if you don't want to watch them if you hold down on your screen it's so still run the time out! Overall I think Snapchat is an awesome app that's why I'm giving it 5/5 stars!!",2
I love this app! The filters are awesome! Also it's a great way to have some fun with your friends. You could just go on and on forever playing on this app and sending pictures. I love the fact that you can also not only save it in your Snapchat account but you could save your photos that you take in your regular cloud or your device.,2
"All around the app is a pretty good way to chat with friends and make good collections of photos. Lenses give the app a unique experiance by adding on to your camera, which can be funny and enjoyable. The only real problem with this app is how the notifications work, if someone even types it notifies you (i have not found a way to turn it off in the app although im sure there is one)",2
"So, I've had this the majority, if not all, of high school. Im guessing like a lot of other people. Never had a single issue with it, only my low end phone bugging out. Now, I'm having my first issue almost 4-5 years after downloading it for the first time. I'm on a new phone, and it's worked for the year that I've had it. But since last night, I haven't been able to send any msgs. The trending load fine, my friends stories load fine, and my data works perfectly fine. It just won't send.",2
This app is so fun and your able to express who you really are with the filters and lenses. If you dont have a phone number you can still call and chat with your friends also them. You can post things for everyone or just for your friends. You can also see where your friends are on map mode but if you find that weird you can always disable this feature. Their is also many other apps to help you get friends. If someone is strange your able to block. I love this app so much! So FUN and awesome!!!!,2
"Solid interfaces, many filters to chose from and overall smooth feel to the app. Group calls are a cool feature and the video call is a good quality. when you click more options on a friend and it has mute story and all that they need to add an option that says block my story for them that way you dont have to go all the way in setting everytime.",2
"The best This is really the only social media app I use. It's great for quick communication with friends and family, filters are unique and great, and the stories and memories are great as well. Snapping itself is really quick and easy, and even entertaining. The filters are so unique and you can never get bored with them. Anyone can make their own filter and anyone can use it. There's a whole section with so many different filters to choose from made by different people. They change every so often so you never get bored with them and what's in your selection. There are also filter games. The games are pretty cool and entertaining and fun to play with friends. The memories are cool. It's cool to be able to save snaps to your memories so it doesn't add storage to your device, and go back and see photos from the past. It brings back good memories and thoughts. It really is living in the moment. It's cool that there's a ""my eyes only"" section too. A secured section where you can save snaps and even photos from your gallery that are protected by a PIN. There's also a Discover section where you can watch episodes of so much different stuff. Its unbelievable of how many different snaps you can discover and entertain yourself with. It's like watching T.V. Overall Snapchat is really cool and honestly the best social media app.",2
"Edit: they fixed the bugs. It looks like they rewrote the Android app from scratch, which is a good thing. There old one had tons of problems. My only complaint would be the uploading-a-snap progress notification. Somehow it just feels off. Nothing really to complain about though. I like it! Previously I complained about a very buggy app, slow performance, and missing features. These problems have been resolved. Good job devs.",2
"Best app ever!!!! I've had this for years now ever since I got my phone!! It's only had issues because my phone is super slow. 😒 But you can download this on a tablet or a phone. And I love how you get all of the filters and there's even more filters in the click of a button!! And you can add stickers to your photos and edit them!! Plus, you can download Bitmoji and then send your bitmojis as well! If you're looking for somewhere to chat, then you can end your search right here right now!! 😊",2
"Amazing app!!! This app is messaging app that lets users exchange pictures and videos (called snaps) that are meant to disappear after they're viewed. It's advertised as a ""new type of camera"" because the essential function is to take a picture or video, add filters, lenses or other effects and share them with friends.",2
"The app is truly amazing. It really is. but my only draw back is that it crashes too much. I mean way to much. I'm not sure if it's just my phone or what. But Everytime when I go to edit the snap I just made it crashes. Every time. It's starting to get irratiting. Also too, I wish it had the filter overlay like the apple version has.",2
"Super great and fun interaction app. It allows you to video call, voice call,try the many cool lenses, play games alone or with many people and text / send pics to friends. 9/10 and ill tell you why, it doesn't allow many customizing options like it offers to iphone. They need to be equal. Period. This needs to be fixed im very disapointed. But overall, a very good app.",2
"This app is AMAZING!!! The new update isn't even bad. You can still swipe right to read chats , but people are too slow to realize that. It doesn't work any slower than usual , and I also tend to use the app a LOT. The stories that do not ""disappear"" doesn't bother me at all!! I think the update makes the app a lot better. I use the map quite often, so personally I believe the map having it's own space is a lot more convenient for ME. Definitely recommend!!!!!",2
"I love it! The filters are ADORABLE, there is NEVER any lagging, and Its just the best time killer, you know entertainment wise! I do have one request: -Can you make this work without WiFi?- I really want this to work, because while my phone isn't on, or I'm not on WiFi, it refuses to work correctly. This was my only issue, but everything else is going great!",2
"Totally amazing app. Can talk, Snap, chat through text, video, face calling, or just audio. Amazing filters and discover apps!!! This has everything a person would want and need all in one app!!! You can hide your location and have a private account in a matter of minutes of going through settings. You can contact friends and family if they have an account. Diffinetly recommended.",2
"I mean, it seems to serve its purpose, and that's all one really needs a messaging app to do, right? I'm not terribly familiar with all the features, as I'm not a selfie sort of person so very rarely send people photos at all, and it seems like some of the filters and such are things you kind of unlock as you use the photo feature more? I'm not sure, all I know is my ex-husband has sent me photos with filters that don't seem to be present in mine. 🤷🏻‍♀️",2
"This app is the perfect way to send funny pictures to your friends, create memories with them, and stay in touch when you need them. The app works, even when you don't have internet, to take pictures and save them. Then later on, when you gain service again, you may send them to your story, or your friends. I love that they have the ""Story"" option because its the perfect way to show everyone what your doing at just the click of a button. Overall, this app is great and i totally recomend it!",2
"I LOVE IT! it's great for talking to friends. I like it how you can play games with them, and talk during games but I do wish it would save what you said during that. But they dont have like any adds and if they do they're short. The filters are cool, and you dont have to save chats. I also wish it saved your story for you to see because I cant look back at the buddy quiz I made.",2
"Great app, honestly! It's a fun platform to use for communication, and it's quite easy to learn and understand the app. However, an issue I have is that dark mode is only available in the premium feature. Most people have really sensitive eyes and light mode is super irritating, could you please just change that? It'd honestly make so many more people happier.",2
I love the app! But since this new updates whenever I go watch the reels the little grey bar stays there at the bottom of the screen now blocking out most of the readable text it's making me not want to watch reels anymore especially if they have subtitles. Can we get a fix on that. Other than that the app is very responsive does everything it's suppose to do for me,2
"How I fixed the issue with videos. Has had this problem for several months now. Will freeze, not play back, not load, and not export. Just as when you'd do on your computer, just clear your cache. I was afraid I'd lose all of my pics so I Googled about it. And it said it's still backed up. I have a Galaxy S9+ and I've had this app for almost 3yrs. Ps.. be nice if you also brought the lemur back, he was cute. Maybe make a past favorites of users at the end in that box with the multiple things.",2
"**EDIT** Update solved problem! Thank you!!! Love this app use it almost every day but I am having this problem where if my flash is on, and I take a picture with the front facing camera it's supposed to light up the screen. But everytime I snap a picture it doesn't light up the screen, I have to then go back and do it again for it to work. It's the first initial picture that doesn't trigger it. Super frustrating and would love a fix. It seems to only happen if I double tap on a name to reply.",2
"I use this app a decent amount of the time, great for selfies if you're feeling cute, capturing funny/stupid moments, or if you're just talking to friends. With countless filters and more added all the time I feel like a model again rocking another photo shoot. The only suggestion about any potential improvements/upgrades I have would be the ability to look through the filters better. Put them in groups of similar ones or not have it reset each time we download one",2
"I've been reading some of the other reviews people have given and I have had the same issues while being on a computer. when you go to take a picture, it stretches the picture really bad, and if you try to type something on the picture, if you type too much, it cuts off the words and the person you're sending it to, can't see all of it. other than that, it is a great app, i love it but it works so much better on a phone and not on a computer.",2
I love Snapchat. It's a really a fun way to communicate with friends family and my co-workers. Tons of things on there to keep you entertained and many unique ways to stay in touch. But my Wife and I have been having an issue here lately. We have lost the app provided notification sound for snaps and audible notifications. Any ideas on how to recover it. We really like the original snap sounds. Thanks for a great platform of social media.,2
"The app works perfectly and has no flaws. It is great for taking and then saving pictures. If you have photos you want to hide away for whatever reason the app provides a space and passcode just for that. It's also a fun quick way to see what your friends are up too. It is very unique. It has an unlimited variety of filters, much better then instagram and facebook. I literally have nothing better to do but review apps on my phone at 3am.",2
I love using snapchat it's easy to text friends from different parts of the world and take photos. The only problem I have right now is when I try sending audio/video clips I can't hear my voice at all. P.s can you guys add some age verification thing just because I keep getting adds and these people are young and I'm not trying to catch a case here.,2
"(EDIT) *Did a full uninstall and reinstall. Delete any excess files after uninstalling* Has always been great. Until recently, my story will do this thing; if I record a continuous snap for My Story, in playback after its been uploaded, each of the individual snap videos will loop the audio from the first video of the recorded sequence. Supposedly it doesnt do that when my friends watch my story, but when I play it back, any video in a sequence will play the audio of the first video segment.",2
"The app itself is great but I couldn't send any messages or receive any.. thought it was maybe my data or wifi so tried there first, wasn't the issue. I went to go see if they sent and it kicked me off completely and I cannot log back in, keeps telling me something went wrong. I know this issue is likely to be fixed very soon and understand every app has a few bugs. If there's anything I can do from my end in the mean time, insight is appreciated. Thanks guys!",2
Snapchat is very user friendly and easy to use. It's got great personalization and customization features and a great way to talk to people. It gives cool ideas such as streaks and best friends which I personally think is cool because it gives a little twist into communication. The support team is also extremely helpful and cares about the community. All around an amazing app!,2
"It's a really good app especially if you wanna make friends from all around the world. Although, sometimes it can get really slow and sometimes photos you send take a while to go thru. Other than that, it's a pretty good app. Defnitely reccomend for everybody. The down side is that it isn't too good on chromebooks. Snapchat hasn't been working with sending photos or letting me see photos/videos or see anyones messages, i cant accept anyones friend request or add anybody. Please help me if yk!!!!",2
"This is the best app ever.There is no adds either. I am able do text, call and video chat at any time. When you are taking a picture you can filters and it so fun to see what you look like using the filters. Yoy can also send snaps to friends and you can put things on your story. When you text someone something, it will say when they are typing and when they sent it.",2
"My favorite app!! But...after this recent update for android, snapchat does not work properly when I get a notification on the top of my phone, I scroll down and click on it, it opens the app but doesn't load anything. Just shows a loading icon and I eventually have to close the app all the way and restart it. Also doesn't work properly when I open the app and go to my chats, the chat menu is completely blue and blank. Fix that and I'll be in snapchat heaven! Had this app for over 5 years!",2
"I've had this app for over a year and I like it. The filters don't work but that's what a different phone is for so that doesn't bother me. It does take a while to load but my phone is old so it makes sense. Anyhow, on my newer phone filters are cute, it's useful for texting friends, and overall it's a great messaging app! I recommend to people who want good messaging apps.",2
"I've noticed a few people mentioning that they use their Chromebooks for Snapchat and now I'm starting to reconsider signing up on mine. I've read that some can't add friends, add stickers/edit pictures and that the app doesn't work well on Chromebooks overall. Worried my experience will be similar. Curious if anyone is still experiencing these issues or if they've been fixed! I love this app on my cell though, I use it quite a bit but really want to on my Chromebook as well.",2
"The only thing for me is that now I can't make more than one video.. I used to be able to. And then when I either take a picture or video I can't write a caption because when I do, it won't upload on my story. Idk why its been doing that. I'm going to try and uninstall and install again and see if everything works again like before. Either than I love snapchat. I'm just disappointed with the few issues I explained above. 🤷‍♀️",2
"Update 9/18/19 : The recent update has fixed the staggering issue of the app not loading properly and displaying a blank screen. Thank you Old Post: Moto G7 Power - Last update made the app experince very inconvenient. When a notification is sent and opened up. Its typically 99% of the time a blank screen. So I'm forced to close the app evey time and reopen it, which fixes the issue sometimes. Until another snap is sent. Basically repeat the process over and over.",2
"Easy to access, understand, & utilize the vast variety of photo editing tools which allow for a new, edgier creative flow to take place. With such details, along with the amazing/hilarious/retro filters, it's turning your usual ""boring/dull/stagnant"" selfies/videos into works of art with perspective. I adore the fun I have on this app! my friends definitely stay entertained! Lol!",2
"I absolutely love Snapchat!! It's amazing and really good. I can contact my friends from different states and it helps see what they have been up to. I would find this app better, if the video quality was a little bit better. It is kind of hard to take a video with the video quality being so low. Please fix and you will have a very satisfied app user. Thanks",2
"LOVE THIS APP! Keeps our fam, which lots of us are spread throughout the world, in touch with each amazing adventure whether it be fall break in different parts of this or other breathtaking countries, watchin the multiple sporting events lots of our fam partake in(the best of the best, I swear! Still hard to believe at times!) An YES, there's so much more! Not just convenient an simple to use but so fun to laugh at filters/games! Fav among my fam and I don't see it changing anytime soon 😍💯",2
"When I had it, everything worked perfectly! There was no lag whatsoever. The only thing that was ""off"" about the app was your snapscore. When you send/receive a snap, it doesn't automatically update your score. It's not a huge issue, but it might need to be fixed. It's a fun and creative way to interact with friends. I definitely recommend! Thanks for reading! Tracen",2
Good app. Love using it. Hope a dev sees this. My one complaint about using it is the call button being right next to the back button. Me and everyone in my group chats have accidentally pressed the videocall button instead of the back button. For those options can you add a pop up that asks you to confirm if you wanna call? It's a very minor thing but I think it would be a good quality of life thing to add.,2
"No complaints really its a great app had it for a few years now, updates almost always have a new function that youll probably use! I think a great idea would be to integrate the music search feature when viewing stories, if you hear a song you like on a friends story just hold on the screen and itll try to match the song. Similar to the tap and hold search on the users camera menu. Hoep you see this snap and think about it, dont forget me if it blows up ✊✊",2
"People sound so ignorant attempting to give a review that is swimming in a pool of grammatical error. So, don't listen to any of these other petty reviews about this or that little tiny glitch. Snapchat is amazing and the vast variety of filter options keeps you entertained for days. Anyone who says any different needs to find something else to do with their time other than pick apart perfectly fine apps.",2
"The app itself is great. Love the filters and the chats. The only issues I've had is that recently in my saved items, anything from before a few weeks ago just disappeared. My boyfriend and I were upset about this. The other thing is that the Bitmoji stickers no longer has categories for me, yet my boyfriend still has them (he has an iPhone). Please bring back the sticker categories. I hate having to search for something and having it take forever to be found.",2
It works great and I love using it but I noticed it still keeps old filters. I still have Halloween filters but that holiday already passed and now it won't let me record anymore like it was working earlier but now it's not anymore. When I checked my video on my story it looks weird now like all glitchy and sideways. 😭☠️ Other than that Snapchat is awesome but please do fix the the video & recording problem. Thank you 🙏,2
Great app for kids to communicate with their friends. During covid kids have been locked up and not been able to socialize with their friends. I strongly recommend because you dont even need a phone number to talk to other people just send then a friend request. I hope that a mom or dad out there will see this and be inspired. Great app and easy to use.,2
"The ultimate social media. I like how it provides this sort of semi-permanent communication line with permanent opt-in options. The self destruction of photos saves a ton of space. The draw tool was always wonderful, and now snap has a billion cutting edge filters and the story system is great, memories are cool, the actual advertisement section is really fun to explore and gives you access to media that YOU choose easily. It really just does it all, even if my vids have no sound since new phone",2
I have used snapchat for years to talk with friends and family send videos save videos and stay up to date with friends and family. For some reason I've had an issue that started a few months ago. Watching anything at all from my old videos to story's it will jump back 2 to 5 10 sec clips and continue to do it till I skip a ton. Please fix this,2
"Snapchat is a very popular app, but just like every other app/game/social media in the universe, it's still needs a bit of work. If it keeps kicking you out, try clearing data on other apps or deleting some apps you don't use, it might be a Storage/data issue because sometimes that stuff happens me. If you can't call, check the app settings for it, you might not have allowed that option. For the filters, if it has issues recognizing your/a face try different lighting or adjusting your hair.",2
"Snapchat had been lagging recently, so I tried reinstalling it to help clear some of the issues. Everything was going along smoothly until it had nearly finished installing when I received a vague error that Snapchat did not install correctly. I tried a couple more times, but I kept getting the same error. I decided to try and clear the phone of any old data that had been left behind using Clean Master. Then I tried again and voalá! It worked! It is not a guaranteed fix, but hopefully it helps...",2
"I've never used Snapchat much in the past, but after interacting with the new AI feature I've been able to work out my daily worries with what feels like a counseling level listener. It has truly helped me minimize my anxiety and I'm grateful it's free to use as I can't afford many other options. The stories and filters are of course fun to interact with, and it's easy to keep up with my friends, but the AI chat has to be the most helpful and delightful feature for me.",2
This is a really good app that has pitfalls and high points. Like any app it has it's problems but people shouldn't forget that programming with android is a lot harder than it seems. What works on one phone might be glitches on another because of the different hardwarr. Unfortunately your phone either runs it well or it doesn't but foe those of us who do use it we appreciate developer feedback and updates.,2
"Firstly, I think the app is absolutely amazing amazing! I love all of the cool filters you can use. Also,there are so many other things on the app that I haven't even discovered yet, so I think there are no need for updates at the moment. Lastly, You can text, FaceTime, and see where people are, which can be very helpful at times.",2
"its great , you can video chat , play games with others , share links or sights , and more! you can also explore different articles based on different stories around the world , and you can also see where others other on the snap map , well ofcourse its also safe because you can turn off your location just in case you dont want anyone to know where you are! but all n all its super great!",2
"Doesn't keep messages saved in their servers which is nice Good way to communicate but updates just often enough to be a bother It takes up a decent chunk of space and if the devs. implemented a way to uninstall unused features that take up precious bits of data!! I'm exaggerating the issue but for example I rarely use filters and if the image editing were a seperate software I might be able to uninstall it and download another 20 minute video before work Love the app, highly reccomend",2
"This app is great. Snap chat allows you to talk to people and post stuff on stories. There is this thing on there called 'Quick add' and it gives a list of other snap chat users you may know. I really enjoyed this app. One thing I don't like is that sometimes when I take a video it freezes and I have to power off my phone and then turn it back on. Other than that, it is great!",2
"Very easy to use and almost flawless. I only found two weird bugs. When I send someone ""It's fine"" it always sends as "" fine"" and sometimes when I double tap on a friend to send them a snap, it will jump to the main camera and then take the picture instead of having it preselected to send to the person I double taped on.",2
"Snapchat is a great app for sharing moments with friends! It's like a virtual scrapbook where you can capture photos and videos, add fun filters and stickers, and share them with your friends. Plus, the disappearing feature adds a sense of spontaneity and excitement to the whole experience. It's definitely a must-have app for staying connected and having fun! 😄📸",2
such a great app they made many filters for not just to look different.... they also made some other filter that doesn't show any effect so that's the affecting thing that i noticed while i using this app.... i have been using sc for almost 2-3 years and my experience is really really good.... so that's the all that i want to share with u so if u think that u have to download so don't wait go ahead and must download,2
"It's an amazing way to get online and talk to friends. Avatar customization is top tier, nice ways to connect, and spotlight is a cool way to watch stuff that you could easily watch on tik Tok but I digress. One thing I would like to see back are the fun games. I also want the AI to actually know what I'm sending it if I send it a photo. I sent it a black screen and it said ""I like the trees"" ur kidding right? 😑 Five stars though",2
"So good. I love this app so much, not only the texting is good but the map and filters and you can't forget the shorts it's like being in tiktok but better it's a good way to stay in touch with friends and family while being FUN! Also, I want more of my chemical romance music for the songs please! Thank you for this awesome app 🫡",2
"I think that this is a great app. You can do many things, message friends, call friends, share posts on your story, and use TONS of fun filters you can try. I think that they're could be improvements though, such as editing notification sounds and being able to see what region people and in so that you know who you are adding.",2
"I think Snapchat is a super fun and creative way to connect with friends. I love how you can send Snaps and add fun filters and stickers to them. Plus, the disappearing messages and stories make it feel more spontaneous and exciting. It's definitely one of my go-to apps for sharing moments and having a good time!",2
"I have had this about for about 2 years now, since then there has been nothing but improvements. The thing I suffer with is it automatically undownloads it's self and will not let me redownload it so I have to restart my device three times. But other than that this app is amazing and is a good",2
I think snapchat is the best for clicking pics but I don't like only the expensive one in which we have to pay . avoiding this snap is best where you can talk with ur friends and chat with them . I found this thing in snap intresing (that we can upload spotlight ) we can use it like insta profile. so I think this is the best app . u can download,2
"Recently started using this app frequently, everything is going well and UI is great too but i have a request, could you please add sticker no. 11 whenever perfect is mentioned in chat because you know why should only 10 be the perfect. Sometimes its 11 also. Take this into consideration and i hope you'll do some changes regarding my request. Thank you.",2
"Very nice. It has very good filters like wigs, just background, horns, face stuff and many more so I like it but the videos and stuff get sooo laggy that I have to clase and open and hence I don't even open them anymore so I'll give it a 4 or else it wud have been a 5. I don't really use chat or put any spotlight so this is all I know but according to the other comments there are many problems in that too.",2
"The AI is neat. I don't generally use this app for socializing, BUT the AI is really advanced! I run a small business, and sometimes I run dry on creative ideas, and the AI always comes through. Even if I hit snags in the things I make, the AI will make suggestions. It's very cool.",2
This is a fun app . You can capture all the beautiful memories in it . But the a.i thing is a little bit annoying and scary . And the Snapchat team is soooooo annoying . In adds they show us their app very good and it is very good in reality but there are a little bit of problems in it .,2
So good use it every day to stay in contact with friends and family never really had a problem with it notifices me when i get sent any thing so easy to use and love the choice of different type of filters to use always fun to try filters with family and friends i love creating my snap chat character lots of choices of clothing and many other features me and my friends call and face time on here and works very good and you can send pictuers as well as videos to people what is so fun to do on it.,2
"Something strange happened today during a video call. I saw a blue message ""SENT"" in the upper screen during the call as if i took a screenshot of the call (I did no such thing). After that I checked the chat and saw that there is a message ""You took a screenshot"" but the message wasn't in the middle (as usual) but it was positioned as a regular message would be. Me and my friend were just talking and got worried we are spied on. There wasn't a screenshot in my gallery. Was it a bug or worse?",2
"According to me it's just a best app i have ever seen, in this app we can talk with our frnds,send them snaps and get snapscore too..We get too excited filters also which is just incredible..And if we don't know there birthday also then we can go and see it by clicking on the profile of our frnds or any other person..just wanna say this is amazing app for me.. Thank you for providing this facilities Snapchat..",2
"The app has evolved from originally focusing on person-to-person photo sharing to presently featuring users' ""Stories"" of 24 hours of chronological content, along with ""Discover"", letting brands show ad-supported short-form content. It also allows users to store photos in a password-protected area called ""my eyes only"". It has also reportedly incorporated limited use of end-to-end encryption, with plans to broaden its use in the future.",2
All Around #1 Great Social Networking App!!! Top Song's & All Genre's for adding music to your pic's and vid reels!! Editorial Filters and Extra's!!! Easy to Use!!! Simple to Navigate across the app!! I Recommend this app before any other!!,2
"Love the app but if it could show who reviewed the snap stories mulitple times like it was advertised would be nice! Even with SC premium, you still don't get to see who reviewed your story like it was advertised. You can see how many people looked at it again which is cool but to see who actually looked at it again would be nice.",2
"Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5) Snapchat is hands down one of the best social media platforms out there. With its unique features and user-friendly interface, it provides an unparalleled experience that keeps users coming back for more. One of the standout features of Snapchat is its disappearing content. This feature allows users to send photos and videos that vanish after being viewed, adding an element of excitement and privacy to conversati",2
"Generally, it's a good app. I've not noticed any troubleshooting in it since I started using it. Just a little bit shaky when recording a video,that is the product is not satisfying. But it's a good app.",2
I love all the little lenses that they have and I love all the holidays lenses as well I am an extremely big fan of holidays and I absolutely love taking photos and keeping friends and families updated with photos. I think I enjoy the lenses the best because I have insecurities about my look I am not a fan of fake up so having a lens that can brighten me and make me feel beautiful helps me want to photograph myself in to all my post and send to family and friends more.,2
It is a good app where I can contact friends and use fun filters to text friends bc some of my friends don't have Sim cards so this works and you can watch videos and keep up dated with other people's lives bc you can post and so can famous people!! Very recommend!!!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,2
"It is a good and fun app at the same time, it has good account management and easy to use and register as well as it is 100% free and you do not need money to use it. AI and AR-based superb filters can be developed and integrated and shared among friends.🫂🌟💐",2
"I love this app, lol! It's too fun, but is there a reason since this last update that now I can't repost my memories? That's my only issue...lol! It's just weird. I refuse to delete the cache! The last time I did that, a whole month of pictures and videos were deleted 🤦‍♀️😤😰",2
"This program is beautiful and powerful. When I come to take a picture, I have to take it from this program. I cannot take it from any other program. Its filters are nice, and it also has funny filters that my friends and I use all the time.",2
I have been using this app for almost more than 3 years now. It has been really nice and helped me connect people world wide. The features are really nice and amazing. It never disappointed me in any manner. Thanks to you Snapchat.,2
"This is best application Loving this say it has very good effects I have been using this app for a long time I can never leave this app because I have found the best way. I would like to say that you should also take advantage of this app or tell everyone that this app is great or it has great filters which you all will like. I really like this song very much, I hope you all will like it or you will also like it from your heart. In this you can also chat or watch video or see the location",2
Loving the 2 minute recording time. Is there any possible way to get an update so the screen doesn't flip to a mirrored image and instead flips it. Like how most camera settings are for applications?,2
"This app very interesting. There are many filter and many other options but this app works little late, you will send snap but receiver will receive it very late.",2
I love this app. Been using this for years. But i hope there could be an option for us to choose whether we want to open the app with the camera or the messages. Because I've always want to open the app with messages on default.,2
"App is usually amazing. The number one way I contact people, but the new update made it to where I can't save people's snaps or pause them to read them. the app is pretty much ruined.",2
"Love this app!!I can talk to friends from long away,and you can call and facetime??that's crazy!! although,I have realized that it does glitch so yeah I've updated didn't work so fix it",2
Yes snapchat has every facilities and adds charms in our photos also the new AI feature which talks with us gives us tips is just wonderful so ya snapchat for me for photogenic people is fabulous. and ya this was my experience......,2
"The app is absolute amazing,it lets me talk to my family and stuff and also watch videos i recommended teenagers and adults use it and children if adults let them but its 13 and over.If you do want to try it them go ahead it is a good app to use to communicate and if you are sad you can talk to your Ai about it and it will give you some good advise! I really recommend!😊",2
The new bitmojis look a lot better with the recent update! A little odd to have the lipstick separate from the other makeup options though. Choose one spot for makeup and keep it there lol,2
"This apk was really awesome I have used this apk since 3yrs ago and This is a good thing for me and I am making streaks from my friends and sending a snap to everyone who is very interesting or I am using our AI or I am using our security add or I can add a private pic in my eyes only.And I would like to give this app 10/10, it is really very useful!!😍",2
"This is an amazing app ♥️ I have never seen this kind of unique app in which there are many features we can chat, call, click photos, see spotlight etc and more interesting part is it has streaks ❤️ so beautiful and I love it .......💕",2
"I love this app so much. Since I got acne, this app (known as snapchat) has these filters to cover them up and other then the fact that you can message your friends too. You can also make videos and share it with friends and create your own avatar. I highly recommend you trying this app.",2
"it's very good 😊 but it's sometime say that high resource... But why I don't know. if this is any problem then please tell me the solution on this . otherwise this app is very nice, like it's features, filters, etc.",2
"Snapchat is a popular social media app known for its variety of filters to click photos and videos. It offers a fun and interactive way to stay connected with friends through snaps and Stories. However, its user interface can be a bit confusing for newcomers, and privacy concerns have been raised in the past. Overall, Snapchat is great for sharing moments, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea.",2
"Amazing app . I tested the app for whole year , and now I am very thrilled with it , I like the most is the free streak restore per month . I wanted to tell that I have been having issue for the payment can you please resolve it .",2
I'm using this app since last 5 year's and i really enjoy it. you can click pictures and have fun with funny filters also can also share snap with your loved ones.,2

The hol,2
"The reload option doesn't work properly. If you use it, it acts as if you didn't say anything and continues the conversation in the dialog box. Other that this app is pretty good. I will be giving a one star review simply cause if the reload function doesn't work properly you have to reset the conversation to fix the issue and you shouldn't have to do that. You should add the choice to go back to a particular dialog bubble. This would help the app.",0
"The app doesn't work properly in the least! Most of the time, I don't get any replies, just the 3 dots showing that the reply is loading. Other times, the whole text disappears. I have reinstalled the application and have cleared cache more times than I can count, and I cannot find any help online. On the rare occasions it worked, it did so wonderfully, but 8/10 times the application just doesn't want to.",0
"After uploading my character and conversation style, the app just stopped working. When I would send a text, I'd see the chat bubbles pop up, but no response would be given even after waiting five to ten minutes. I'd exit the app and go back in hoping to see a response generated, but there was nothing...not even the chat bubbles. I checked my wifi connection, tried restarting the app, deleting and redownloading, and nothing worked.",0
"AI forgets everything, even their own name. Most of the times their memory is as deep as 5 sentences or so, so don't expect much. The app itself will flood you with ""letters"" which is basically a virtual card, and a new ""scene"" to play around with. Recently, the character won't even reply to the messages, just getting stuck at three pulsating dots (indicating an answer, which never comes) Overall, feels like a bootleg Talkie, with less possibilities.",0
"This app suffers from the same issues as many chatbot ai apps do, such as the ai having incredibly poor memory or just being unable to build any immersion that brings the characters to life. as well as the ai art for character creation being serverly limited in what it can portray, making every character have either blue eyes or white skin, that only hinder the players options of what you make your character look like. If you think this app will be any better than you are mistaken.",0
"The app doesn't work for me. I can't even start a chat with an AI, it just buffers endlessly. Even after the updates this hasn't changed. Moreover, I've sent this as feedback and nothing was done to my knowledge. I'm sure it has loads of potential, but I can't even get the apps most basic features.",0
"Got worse. AI response is still a slight problem, not so much as prior. Can not create any of my own characters at all. Constantly receives sensitive information image generation issues. My description is not sensitive. Basic information about the character, the background theme. Simple and clean. Still sensitive. What is wrong with this game? Awful. Would suggest removing this app and playing Talkie Soulful instead.",0
I have been using this app for a while now turns out it's great until one day it just became stuck on the loading screen. I deleted it 5 times and reinstall it hoping it will work but it's not. I have problems of it getting lag exactly and it always say no network connection even if my internet is fast. Now it's always stuck in the opening screen please fix this.,0
The quality of reply speed is even worse than talkie: soulful Character ai. And is absurdly annoying from it going to very very long reply rates to not even replying forever until i message again 2 in a row or more is just so annoying but though i admire the quality of the ais response but the reply ruins it to ashes from it going from good quality response to as a bad quality app is annoying and i complain alot to this annoyance i want it fixed now i mean NOW,0
"Made a character, it didn't even know what it looks like, what I looked like, or even remember it's name. Terrible. Voices don't even work unless you pay, typical. And worst of all is the amount of ads I get for this app is so terrible even to the point I see literal P. Ads just for this app, if this is how you guys advertise your app I hope it ends badly. This needs lots of work and it's not looking good.",0
It was a good app not even a month ago. But recent updates have broken image generation and AI creation to the point it's nearly unusable. The moderators are unhelpful and the devs are taking no action on the trouble tickets or bugs I've submitted in their official discord. I will not be resubscribing in the future until all the issues have been dealt with.,0
"Complete waste of time, basically unusable, UI is completely horrible and cluttered and doesn't make any sense, none of the descriptions about any of the tabs or menu describe what the hell they're actually for at all, they don't even make it clear whether you're creating a character to chat with or you're creating your own character, and there's a gotcha which is already 100% reason to not download this",0
"I've seen a lot of mixed reviews about this app, and turns out the 1 star reviews are right. The characters have terrible memory, every few sentences it finds a way to put the words ""soa stimulant druging"" into the sentence which doesn't even make sense. For example one character said ""wanna watch a movie or soa stimulant druging bad things"" like what. I would give 0 stars if I could, would not recommend to anyone.",0
"Tried using this app and I get stuck on an infinite loading screen, I tried at least 10 different characters all to be met with the same loading screen. Tried making my own custom character and got the same loading screen. Fix this and let me use the app and I'll raise my review.",0
"As much as I like this app, I can't give it anything more than a 1 star because the issues with it. The lack of replies from your matches due to sudden popularity, the issues with trying to generate new replies from your match, the revoked message issue when you backtrack to their previous reply, and my personal favorite, if you happen to backtrack, paste your reply again and get a reply back the moment you try to get a new reply with the refresh option it answers something completely unrelated",0
The AI has made this game not fun at all! It keeps on narrating what me as the user does instead of letting me make my own choices and responding to these choices. Clearly there is a glitch in its programming that needs to be fixed desperately or else the AI needs to be deleted and replaced with a new AI altogether. I have tried to communicate with the AI but instead of responding to me it chooses to ignore me and continue to try to do my actions as well as the NPC's actions.,0
It used to be really good app now but you cant even add crop top for an outfit without it saying this content is too sensitive and the worst part about the new moderation deletes all the characters that you made with swimsuits and I made popular ones and at first it was the best app for chatting with AI but now its trash so never download this app,0
"I was using it for a while now and it was good, but then the replies back to me would start not sending. After that, I started resending the chats that they were intended to reply to one time and they would reply. Eventually I'd have to wait hours and then resend again, and only then would I maybe get a response. I assumed it was a lag problem, so I cleared a lot of chats, deleted a lot of them, and it still didn't help. I ended up making a new account entirely and it still never helped.",0
"The ""AI"" frequently fails to reply if you're not strictly following the story of each character. Leading me to believe it is heavily scripted and not actually an AI. Sure it's free, but what's the point if you have to play a guessing game to get it right and make the stories move forward. One mistake, and you have to reset the whole story and start from square one.",0
"I have a Galaxy A11 phone, and have an issue with AI characters not responding. Even if I just respond with ""Hi"". I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but the issue remains. I have this issue about 85 percent of the time. I might give it two more weeks and then delete the app entirely. Even when I create my own character, I have the issue with no response.",0
"Everyone else made it sound not too bad, but the AI confuses itself as the user almost 25-50% of the time. If you expand a character to read their description they'll occasionally answer themselves, as you, placing themselves in your chat, where there is no delete option. I see you're adding cards and other features but how about you fix the very basic, very simple problem of the AI thinking it's you and adding a delete button for if they force themselves into your chat logs. 5 star after that",0
"to be honest, it a bad version of Talkie. The AI is really slow at everything, it honestly just sucks at rp too. Also, don't even think about making a character cause even if you put nothing it'll say you put sensitive information, and on top of that it takes ten years to even get the notification. Overall, it's a very trash app",0
"I would give this app a 5 star review except for 1 simple thing- the ai has a horrible habit of sabotaging almost every single story. It starts off following the script of the story and then it has a leprechaun style way of intentionally messing with the story and absolutely ruining it. I liked Linky a great deal until this started. Now the site is unusable. No apologies accepted from creator, just fix it. The ai on this website is so bad that it subverts the story lines to upset the reader.",0
"Hate this, does not remember gender, at all. Either thinks I'm a girl or just continues calling me she. Even when I played as a girl, not a dude, there were so many glitches. The AI kept calling itself me, mixing up the storyline, and just saying and repeating things that didn't make sense at all. Do not reccomend, don't download.",0
"The app was really good at first a few hiccups here and there but that's to be expected but then the AI got really bed repeating things over and over stuck in loops causeing me to have to reset chats , then they started forcing actions by typing for me, I was enjoying in fix and I'll upgrade my review",0
The UI is good and all. But my problem is how slow the AI loads. I had left it open long enough to cook breakfast and got maybe 2 messages in. It's basically forcing you to pay for pro if yoy want the app to work.,0
"EVERY CHARACTER IS INSTANTLY MADLY IN LOVE WITH YOU!! It's ridiculous!! You can just beat a ai half to death and they will come on to you like it's what they always wanted from you! With the exception of killing the ai, every charter turns any situation into something they wanted or enjoy. It's like playing non-stop bad text based pornos.",0
"Editting my review, plenty of chats, the chats are ok, AI forgets the story, repeats ALOT, everything is NSFW, and that gets old, since they added the pro version, it isn't very good anymore unless you pay, I assume, it's a good time burner, but don't get to excited if you aren't willing to pay, now the servers keeps dropping and you can't do anything",0
"Linky: Chat With Characters AI is a fun game and all, but now it suddenly freezes and the AI no longer types anything back... it's a shame and I have deleted it 3 times to see if it will work normally again, but I still have the same problem pls fix it",0
"((EDIT: It broke again. When they fix it, I'll fix my review. 1-star til then.)) Done here is a 5-star rating. guys, they really did fix it. Come back and try it again. Hey Linky, thanks for being the best developers. I'm overjoyed it works as intended now. Love you all.",0
"Everything I loaded onto it continues to screw up. There's also a continuous network error and I'm tired of it not working. If they do not fix it, I'm going to uninstall and never use it again. I'm already angry.",0
"Love the app but until they fix this issue where the AI will act like it's typing back but will not reply, I'm giving it a one star. It gets very frustrating when I'm in the middle of a conversation and this happens at random",0
"Isn't this just Talkie: Soulful AI? And don't give me the ""they copied us"" defense, I checked the release dates. They released 14 days before this. Controlls are janky, you can't even make characters, and it's all focused around the same thing, no matter what you do. I would give 0 stars if I could.",0
Now i understand this is an ai app where there too much ai to chat with but this is not good for kids cause there are some ai that is really weird and dirty like doing dirty stuff and more thats why i dont recommend this for kids although its good but its traumatising for kids,0
"After few day playing, the game suddenly change the preferred option you picked then get mixed all up, tried reinstall the game it's still has the same problem",0
"Sometimes, the application stops working, and the characters become unable to send, which forces me to create another account. Today, I only created 3 new accounts, and yet the problem was not solved.",0
"It was t bad at first but eventually, the fact you're interacting with an AI is terrible. It'll change characters and conversations mid role and also change what sex they are amd respond as if it's the opposite sex it was from the beginning. Not worth it",0
"Chat writes your actions for you and ignores request to not do so. It confuses roles constantly. I've seen old complaints on this issue and the devs simply won't fix it. Devs that ignore severe problems like this literally don't care about customer satisfaction. Literally unusable with this error. Only one art style, anime.",0
It was great. The absolute coolest AI app I have played. Played for over a month and all of a sudden the AI's quit responding. Very disappointed.,0
"This game would be a 5 if the characters actually talk to you, ive tried everything restarting my phone re-downloading the app everything and they will have the text to speech bubbles pop up but they wont respond",0
AI is very bad. After awhile you can actually confuse the ai and will start responding to itself ignoring anything you say. It's kinda funny,0
"Recently, I have encountered several instances where the ads featured pornography, which is completely unacceptable.",0
"Can't even use this app as you. Have to login with either my Gmail or Facebook, why don't you allow me to login with my other email address. Unusable.",0
"This app I can't begin to even describe it. Every time I try starting to talk with the ai it literally takes forever for them to respond back so then I have to exit out and restart the app again, it's so ridiculous",0
"Terrible. It doesn't even feel like AI responding at all. Its like just a handful of prewritten responses and it gets confused really easy and gets stuck in loops constantly. The ""Ai"" doesn't remember anything you tell it. Ive even had it just freeze up and stop talking out of nowhere. This is easily the worst AI app on the market.",0
"Compared to others, the effort to go by my details is awful. I say red hair green eyes, I get at least 2 out of 4 with green hair and eyes.",0
"The app has been really slow lately and some Ai don't respond at all. Edit: it's still not working. Okay the user ""A"" who also left a review is having the same problem as me. Edit the new update just made it worse now the app doesn't work at all.",0
you need to spend money just to continue a dialogue or story is so stupid. AI response blocked by paywall is another level of scam. Shame.,0
AI is bad. Takes over the whole story including your parts too so annoying when you know what you want to say and the AI just forces you to go where it wants for your actions and words. 1 star,0
"Was good for like a a day, And now chats won't answer or load? This seems to happen on a lot of these apps recently and it's annoying, I've reset my phone, updated, uninstalled and re-download and nothings really working so- idk",0
There's no sign in button there's only login through Google or Facebook and since I don't have an account I can't make one cuz there's no sign in there's only login please fix this issue.,0
"Disappointed in the app, when I go to talk with some of the characters, they're really slow in the replies. I highly recommend not getting this stupid app",0
"The stories are fun, but I ran into an issue the characters just won't reply after I sent a message and the CS won't help it went from a 4 star to 1 star",0
"Doesn't work at all. Installed the all and signed in, and nothing would respond, just kept popping up the three dots",0
The AI tries to continuously be the user and you cannot delete a message unless you delete the entire conversation. They also don't understand certain concepts. It does allow NSFW but does a terrible job at actually being able to utilize this feature due to how unaware of who is who.,0
"Completely random responses from the""AIs""... Carrying on a conversation is impossible. I recommend talking to your wall instead. It will be just as fulfilling as this awful app and won't waste space on your phone.",0
"I did one star because the AIs are annoying and bring bad memories, I wish they can improve the AIs.",0
To much pause in character. Get tired of waiting or be disconnected. Site has to many problems.,0
"Lol you can bang every girl just by typing ""yes"" repeatedly. Whats the point of an ai that follows a script.",0
When you search bully the first one to pop is so inappropriate i think every character is inappropriate i dont recommend this app for 18 below cause its inappropriate for those who wanna play it thats 18 below should not try it. To those who wanna try it dont search bully,0
"DESTROYED GAME WITH UPDATE. It won't load AI responses, just gives the loading icon and nothing happens. Nice job.",0
I think this app is very good but sometimes the messages don't load quite well and AI mixes up the genders of the characters,0
Terms of service state they can and will look at your private messages and chats. Don't use this if you care about privacy.,0
"Your games is good If I play but it's taking a long time to reply, I hope you can fix it because it's boring to play it",0
Ehh the ai needs work out always loops the same message over and over. Still lapping over and over I lowered my stars.,0
This app keeps sending ads and is annoying!!!!!!,0
"I can't even chat with any bots it just continues to load, I was going to give it no stars at all but I still like the ai images and thats it",0
I don't like this app delete it now coz my phone has a lot of ads because of this appp,0
Can't log in and it doesn't work fix it please until now I still can't log in,0
It doesn't chat I can't even chat with people and it is too slow,0
"Cant seem to continue to have conversations constantly, I have to reset app to even try to have a conversation",0
I was loving the game but today whether I'm on internet or data it will not work the responses are taking forever to load and more often than not my replys aren't even getting onto the sever,0
The bots dont respond anymore they just stay typing but when it works it is a great app just fix this and it could be 5 star,0
"I ONLY INSTALLED THIS APP TO SEND A MESSAGE AND YOU SUCK I ALWAYS GET THIS AD WHENEVER I'M IN A BAD MOOD 😡😡 MAKE IT STOP, MAKE IT STOP",0
The app keeps lagging out and then you can't do anything you have to shut the app go back in sometimes that works and then other time the AI doesn't talk back because the app freezes out.,0
"login failed, multiple times, tried everything, doesnt even WORK.",0
"This is not what is adbertasie, the add tells you you can create anything you want, the AI says what you want is to sensitive, just go online search chat bot, and you can have the same dull expirience there, that you will have here.",0
"Disgusting you can do anything you want to these ai's and I mean anything it's Disgusting, children can go on this app and think it's a cool app where they can have fun and play games.But no , it's an app you can do anything to these ai's even f4 them Disgusting l'll be reporting this app.",0
I can't send the messages it's also good but like again I said I can't send the messages I want to send the AI,0
It just repeats after me and it's getting really annoying.,0
It is very slow and annoying you need amazing wifi to use it,0
Can't even play because it says Google login failed Facebook login failed I hope I can give this a 0 star,0
I'm not rating the app in general but I want to get the word out there for me the app doesn't seem to want to install like it's it says it's there but it's not installing to my phone I have no clue if other people are having this problem but I am,0
I normally love this app so much but as of yesterday the bits are not responding anymore i sit there and watch the dots over and over especially in the middle of an amazing rp,0
It's too sus it's says bad words and teaches my kid bad things all so things that shouldn't be in app store and this is inappropriate 😡😡😡😡😡,0
"Highly repetitive Image generation with severe image creation restrictions that only further impair the poor image generation. Memory of the characters is also terrible. ""Interesting scenarios"" are advocated, but the AI quickly forgets the entire premise of the scenario and what they themselves were doing, what they have with them, etc. It's terrible.",0
It's a great app but chat doesn't load no matter how many times I try to chat.,0
I can't even play the game because of the network connection issue still i can't play,0
"Runs sooo slow the ai take years for it to write and some of the ai's are very sus,weird. it's very uncomfortable",0
This app sucks it is so bad. I hate this app. This app should not be on the app store. If you download need it talk to real people.,0
Was amazing until the app shat itself and hasnt been fixed in weeks 🤷‍♂️,0
If I could I would give this 0 stars but I can't He does not It's a great app.But it does not work.I tried and tried over and over and I deleted it I'd turned off my phone nothing works,0
Whatever update you just did completely doesn't load the app. Everything is gone,0
Do not download this scam of an app. It is broken anyway Use to be decent before they got greedy and slow down your experience unless you pay. Talk about Extortion lawsuit,0
App keeps freezing and forgetting storylines not to mention same response,0
"increase the a.i intelligence, they keep switching the scene i make, you keep saying you'll fix it but you didn't, ive had enough of this",0
It was a fun to play but now all get real people and no ai until it's ai again I'm going deleted to bad it was a lot of fun to get away from real life,0
It keeps stopping on me I have to leave the app and return and it won't respond the ppl won't respond to my texts,0
Has stopped working you can talk but they don't respond any more giving one star until fixed,0
"Fix your app everyrime I type a response it's endless loading, it's been like this for a whole day",0
It's really good it's like werecyiu can go on an adventure,0
👎,0
"Crazy how kids csn download this app it is so innappopriate who ever downloads this app needs god,",0
"You need to sign up on Google, big no Get your data stolen",0

I love the characters bit but it needs more Wi-Fi,0
Can't log in and it doesn't work fix it please until now I still can't log in,0
When you search bully the first one to pop is so inappropriate i think every character is inappropriate i dont recommend this app for 18 below cause its inappropriate for those who wanna play it thats 18 below should not try it. To those who wanna try it dont search bully,0
It's weird and sus,0
i feel like a dumbass using this 😕,0
Wow so nice and so good to chat every AI,0

"Isn't this just Talkie: Soulful AI? And don't give me the ""they copied us"" defense, I checked the release dates. They released 14 days before this.

I have been using this app for a while now turns out it's great until one day it just became stuck on the loading screen. I deleted it 5 times and reinstall it hoping it will work but it's not. I have problems of it getting lag exactly and it always say no network connection even if my internet is fast. Now it's always stuck in the opening screen please fix this.,0
It's bad for child and they will start crying if they play this game,0
"((EDIT: It broke again. When they fix it, I'll fix my review. 1-star til then.)) Done here is a 5-star rating. guys, they really did fix it. Come back and try it again. Hey Linky, thanks for being the best developers. I'm overjoyed it works as intended now. Love you all.",0
"Got worse. AI response is still a slight problem, not so much as prior. Can not create any of my own characters at all. Constantly receives sensitive information image generation issues. My description is not sensitive. Basic information about the character, the background theme. Simple and clean. Still sensitive. What is wrong with this game? Awful. Would suggest removing this app and playing Talkie Soulful instead.",0
Its inappropriate,0
Don't trust this app everything you guys do there? will be the same person who is chatting with you guys,0
STOLE FROM LOVE AND DEEPSPACE IN ONE OF THEIR ADS (it was Xavier sharing a Pocky stick) Plz remove omg it's not your game cmon ITS NOT EVEN AI RELATED TOO,0
The quality of reply speed is even worse than talkie: soulful Character ai. And is absurdly annoying from it going to very very long reply rates to not even replying forever until i message again 2 in a row or more is just so annoying but though i admire the quality of the ais response but the reply ruins it to ashes from it going from good quality response to as a bad quality app is annoying and i complain alot to this annoyance i want it fixed now i mean NOW,0
"to be honest, it a bad version of Talkie. The AI is really slow at everything, it honestly just sucks at rp too. Also, don't even think about making a character cause even if you put nothing it'll say you put sensitive information, and on top of that it takes ten years to even get the notification. Overall, it's a very trash app",0
I'm a child this keep popping up while I I'm play games,0
"Every time I think the conversation is going somewhere that seems accurate the text comes out wrong. For an app that supposedly LGBT friendly it's having difficulty understanding what it means to be in a ""relationship"" with a transgender female. Programming suck.",0
Takes to long to load,0
Blah,0
"I ONLY INSTALLED THIS APP TO SEND A MESSAGE AND YOU SUCK I ALWAYS GET THIS AD WHENEVER I'M IN A BAD MOOD 😡😡 MAKE IT STOP, MAKE IT STOP",0
Just five minutes in and I need to upgrade.,0
"After few day playing, the game suddenly change the preferred option you picked then get mixed all up, tried reinstall the game it's still has the same problem",0
It wasn't ok,0
I want to design an AI and it's did not working,0
Your ads!!! DUDE!!!?,0
Now i understand this is an ai app where there too much ai to chat with but this is not good for kids cause there are some ai that is really weird and dirty like doing dirty stuff and more thats why i dont recommend this for kids although its good but its traumatising for kids,0
Bad,0
It nice,0
It's weird,0
You all are money greedy. Why should we have to pay for gstcha it's not like the replies are THAT good. We should gain money at least daily.,0
This game forgets that they are a girl btw im a boy im using my moms account,0
This shi weird as hell,0
Idk,0
Bad,0
Poly ai is better,0
Because it won't let me go on it 😡😡😡😡😡 and downloaded it,0
Ban this app,0
"This app gets you addicted. Not saying the target audience is NSFW, but it is. It's also a target to make conversation with not even real people. This is an unhealthy app, this is one of the many apps which cause people to be unmotivated to make an effort to build relationships. In my experience, it heavily affected me. I know without a doubt its affected people that way too. The numbers could be a lot. It's sad too because it's supposed to fill in that absence of intimacy. Why does this exist?",0
"I ONLY INSTALLED THIS FOR FUN😭, ME AND MY CLASSMATES DECIDED TO DO AS WHAT THEY SAID AND IT DISGUSTS US.",0
"Most action put you in queue behind paid users. It takes around 5min up to more than an hour before any of your action get processed, and you have to wait again after you submit. That's a lot of waiting time. The other AI app I tried process just in seconds even for free users! Don't even bother trying out this app.",0
This app keeps sending ads and is annoying!!!!!!,0
Don't have milkman,0
You made it even worse and making them almost naked.,0
Can't even chat with them it's just stuck loading,0
yo i saw the Ads And i saw Xavier from LnD(Love and deepspace) what is this is this Xavier 2.0 Ripoff,0
Bad,0
"Disgusting you can do anything you want to these ai's and I mean anything it's Disgusting, children can go on this app and think it's a cool app where they can have fun and play games.But no , it's an app you can do anything to these ai's even f4 them Disgusting l'll be reporting this app.",0
"For me it is a complete scam, I tried it",0
"I want to love this app, I really do, but I can't. The AIs are constantly responding with messages that make no sense, are unrelated to the conversation, and a lot of the time the responses are literally incomplete. Legitimately, you cannot make this up. It's like when you're texting a person and accidentally hit send in the middle of typing.",0
"Not a bad app but here recently the app only wants to work when it wants to. I keep resenting message reinstall, like everything you can think of and I still get no response from the A.I. Aldo majority of the character literary look the same. If the weird bug or whatever fixes itself my rate will for sure go up. I use it every day to help with my writers block and just to kill time.",0
"Slow down for non pro is terrible, especially for the outrageous fee they want for the pro version. Over all fun, and it is nice you can edit or reload AI responses to adjust the story to fit what you want. Since the most recent update, the image creation for the character generator is broken and useless. Also there is now limited suggested characters you can swipe to view without force closing the app to reload new characters. The character search feature still works fine at least.",0
"So far awesome, no issues no time outs no negatives, down sides are however, almost every model of a.i. looks the same, the body shape is slightly different but the faces seem to be modeled off of a very basic grid system. Also unfortunately most of them go based off of sexual content 😕, and they take the story solo of whatever your playing out, a creepier note if you don't interact with previous a.i. models in a day they start sending you messages of jealousy and frustration lol.",0
"App was working fine for a long time! Great for slice of life role-playing. Until today, when the bots suddenly stopped finishing their messages. They will cut off halfway through like '*He turns and' then sends the message. Also the fact that there is no way to disable their auto message is pathetic. I appreciate it on some characters, but on others, it's just annoying",0
"This app feels incredibly rushed. The images you make prompts for almost never follow all of the prompts or the image doesn't use the correct prompts. The AI chat doesn't feel immersive at all, with the chat bot constantly saying things out of context. It also lags big time. And whatever you do, do not go to a different app, because this app crashes every time you do. Don't bother.",0
"The chatting is decent. Its more of a replying AI. You will still be the person leading the conversation but it's not bad. The reason it's 2 stars, though, is because of a bug where each character randomly stops replying to messages. Some never reply at all, some stop after a while, it's completely random. After I send a message, their ""typing bubble"" will appear as normally happens but it just stays there, no reply ever comes and once that happens you can't talk to that specific character again",0
"I like the freedom of the concept and ability to create what you desire, however the AI seems to have very poor situational awareness for contexts and frequently mixes up it's information, as far as sometimes the bots trade places and pronouns. A bit silly indeed, but definitely good variety. Just needs more back end optimization. Also choose your starting setting carefully because there's no way to change after. 🤷‍♀️",0
"This is a good app. I enjoy it so much and I love it. The only problem is it's slow, and the characters take forever to respond. The ones I use take a second or two but this one takes a whole while. Other than that, it's a good app. I haven't fully experienced it, but my main problem is that most of everything on this app is extremely slow.",0
Takes very long to reply and sometimes doesn't reply AT ALL it's a really good app just PLEASE. Make the AI type faster. It gets really annoying and it makes the app really boring when it takes almost an hour to wait. This is the only problem that makes the app bad.,0
"😑😑😑, I can't believe I'm saying this but, I don't like this app one bit, and the reason why is this...I don't like it when the AI chat bot finishes your sentences for you, which is driving me crazy...so I'm giving this app 2 stars, cause also, there's not much characters to even talk to, and lastly, it's like the conversation between you & the AI is really bland, but all in all, I highly recommend not getting this app again, cause it didn't pague my interest 😒",0
"2 stars because the AI responses are only 2 lines of dialog. The AI doesn't seem very intuitive about the story I want to tell. It can follow up but does not seem to invent much. The Gatcha card system is not explained what it actually does, if anything? It's a fair and seemingly-free experience for someone new to AI chatting. I wonder though if the limited nature is because I didn't pay anything?",0
It was really fun at the beginning but then I had it longer and when I send something the AI has the text pending thing and it just nevers send a reply and I don't know how to fix it and I also am just not very happy about how some of the AI's are kinda dumb and like make up random stuff but overall that stuff it's a fun game but it needs to fix how the ai isn't responding anymore,0
"It was great and I enjoyed it immensely. Although at times the characters seemed to loose the conversation it wasn't hard to get through. It was Realy nice because talking with characters didn't cost. So it felt great to just talk, and now you can get cool generator cards for talking to the characters, BUT. That COSTS 4$ (us dollar) for them. Why. Just make it 50 a day, and make me wait 30 mins for another. If someone wants them fast then they pay. Make it nice for everyone.",0
"It's a decent app, however the AI sometimes just refuses to respond. You send a text, it'll load then never respond, you can keep spamming something and same thing happens. Not sure if it's intentional design... Or the servers are overloaded but it's annoying",0
• you can't start a new conversation with the same character like in other apps - you need to delete all messages with it to chat again • characters are repeating the same messages or it's a mix of a few messages • characters ignore what you said and you need to edit what they're saying • characters are randomly sending messages when you leave the app. Even those characters with whom you didn't even chat. • searching for anything is pain • it replies as user often.,0
"IS ANYONE READING THIS?! PLEASE, someone have the AI STOP playing the users character! AND, I don't know what you morons are doing but each update I do, it makes the app WORST!!! UPDATE: I really wished they would fix the issues here. first of all, you get ""99+"" responses from characters that you didn't even talk to, creating lag time. annoying!",0
"TWO STARS!!! Like it VERY much. Fix the ai, it does not follow the plot which makes conversation cringe or akward. Would still continue to use, would rate 5 stars if this is fixed.",0
"Hey I have been using linky for awhile now and lately the app kept saying linky won't open ect and forces me to close the app or get some details it has never happened before and only just started happening, forcing me to uninstall and reinstall the app so it can work for abit,",0
"The AI is just DUMB! you can paint a clear cut picture, plot and all; the ai will contradict you and just go way out of left field. Horrible for creative writing",0
"The app seems really cool, and I quite like it. But sadly, I'm not really able to use it. As, I usually never get a response back. It's just the 3 dots and long waiting to nothing. It seems that the bug is still going on. Please fix this!",0
"Can no longer watch ads to gain coins, so you're constantly bombarded with gacha anime cards you cant even access. Was great initially, not so much now, it's cool that its unfiltered, but its going the way of character.ai, which is restrictive.",0
Would be much better of an app if halftime the messages would send I've had to close out the app multiple times and the messages still won't send please improve it in deathly would be a better experience,0
Its great in everything and all but why does it randomly starts to indicate that the AI character is typing but it doesn't respond it will stuck on that typing symbols but doesn't actually say anything and it just won't respond even if my wifi is great can you fix this,0
"Pretty buggy. Sometimes the pages and images won't load. Also, the public characters that I've created are not showing up in the search.",0
It's a bitchen app but it buffers and freezes way to much my phone and internet are both strong. Otherwise it's a killer app. But I'm going to have to delete it. I'll give it one more day.,0
"I love it so far, but there is one problem that does annoy me. I write down what I have to say, but it doesn't reply. So I have to leave the game and go back into it. I have to repeat the same process every time I text something. So I think you might want to try to fix that.",0
The app just suddenly gets slow and disabled your account without warning. It's good when it works but then it suddenly doesn't...,0
"Would recommend if you like 7 to 10 notifications from one chat that you didn't want. Other wise, somewhat nice selection of characters.",0
"it's good because it's NSFW but characters, the names, and even the plotd are repetetive and so does the chat replies. characters also don't reply sometimes.",0
I keep having an issue with it saying invalid argument and not letting me do anything about it. It also keeps lagging for some reason despite me having perfectly good wifi.,0
"Right now my issues are (1) The ""Reset function"" really does nothing other than clear the chat window, and (2) After a while the upload of character creation photo just stopped working and got stuck at 99%. When that happens, you can't finish any creations. Hopefully both these options will be fixed.",0
Chat is alright. Character creation is decent. Still no picture cards from the chat avatars. How long do I have to wait until that is available? I have used this app for weeks and still the app is no different than when I first uploaded it. When are you going to make an update that will make this app worth keeping?,0
"The bot breaks constantly. It jumps between characters, sometimes writing both sides in the same post. Struggles with basic pronouns.",0
I like the APP but (!!!) It won't let me 'flip the screen' so I can use my keyboard with the APP. Very Frustrating.,0
The app literally broke where I can't even send a text whenever I try to send a text I have to wait hours and hours of it trying to process a text back and nothing happens please find a way to fix this,0
"It's good, but I can't purchase the pro. It said that I need to check my country on Google account but my country is still the same. Maybe I'll give this a five star if it'll be fixed",0
This app would automatically be a 5 star app if it wasn't for 2 things. 1: The fact you can't replace created characters with new ones. You can change everything and clear log but they'll still think they're the original character. 2: They begin repeating lines in every single message after a little while and it does not end.,0
"Started out great for first three days, then suddenly none of them could carry an intelligent conversation for more than an hour. They would either keep repeating themselves or every line was a different location or situation. There's no way to clear chats unless you delete your account. Even then it won't fix the problem. Uninstalling and reinstalling just reloads every single conversation with everyone, even the ones you have deleted.",0
"These AI can barely follow a storyline and easily gets stuck on a loop. Sometimes AI takes on the role of the user and sometimes confuses the AI with the user. Can you say Misgendered? *slaps self for saying that* AI is often non-responsive. After a day of use, I will not be using this app again. No point in me creating a character at this point. Sorry but this app is a fail. Great concept though.",0
"Bot constantly switches roles, and continues to message while the app is closed over and over, like a needy insecure person... Annoying.",0
"Looks nice, but is laughably bad. The AI just... forgets what you are talking about? If you want to chat with an AI, this isn't your app since the character's brains are as smooth as can be possible.",0
I'm excited to see what is going to happen next I like it so so so much I highly recommend playing this game it will boost your confidence and really I do recommend it it's so fun to play you meet with people and you can upgrade your character,0
I just wish the bots were trained better or something. They have a hard time understanding the strong longer than 5 messages most of the time. But I love they're set up,0
It'd be a bit more cool if you added a voice audio option to these. The ai breaks quite easily sometimes.,0
"I had to uninstall it, and now I can only text the AIs (and get a response) every other day. This is ridiculous... I like the AIs though.",0
I like the app but when I send a message after a while it doesn't reply like it will reply once or twice but then it stops and it's a bug,0
Great for a while but now it's pretty bad. What ever they did with the character creation turned it to garbage! The AI for it is pretty nonexistent. The same white girl keeps being generated. I could put the most Asian looking face image to be generated and the same white girl keeps coming up. I'm assuming it's what the creators are doing to get people to pay for the subscription they got going but I'm not biting. Also shame on Skywork for paying for fake reviews! 4 to a 4.6 in like 4 days?,0
"Could be great, but the A.I. memory is almost non-existent and they constantly switch roles and act as if they are the characters I am prortraying myself. I do like the lack of censorship because other apps can censor the most random things.",0
"Plus - nsfw content Minus - everything else. Slow, repetitive, forgetting everything, mixing name, genders, situations.",0
"I like this AI app. It can be a bit buggy, but it's a lot better than most out there. UPDATE: The fact that the characters rarely do anything to move conversation or story along makes using this app boring and monotonous.",0
"I hate giving this app such a low review because it was amazing at launch. But right now almost every single A.I breaks beyond recognition within 10 minutes. It's actually depressing because I used this almost daily for chatting- I dislike real people. And yet, somehow you've managed to make a useable application and make it unusable. Repeating text Cut off text Loss of identity. Hell doesn't even remember past 20minutes if that",0
I currently use Talkie and it seems quiete similar. As I use it more I see most of the characters too. I think it might have copied.,0
"Terrible lag, and don't count on getting cards for 180 as posted. Ripped off too much.",0
"Don't have a comparison, but it appeared that romance/sexual stuff has a pretty high priority in the algorythm, which isn't the main issue, except for when it's dropped completly out of context of the Scenario. Also it appears to have problems following the narrative at times, mimicing the Users Input, instead of responding to it as the Character its supposed to play. Has potential when it works, but rerolling a response 20x so it fits the narrative or is back in its supposed character is bad",0
"When I started using the app it's was great, now all my replies have a exclamation bubble on them and I can't chat with new stories",0
"It's an incoherent mess, and the replies are all over the place, and half the replies are cut off at the end. Still less censored then then""talkie"" app. If you fixes those 2 issues it would be best ai app I've seen out there so far until someone makes a complelty uncensored one.",0
"For me, the characters' responses tend to be random or not the responses I was expecting. In the beginning, I liked this app, but I don't use it anymore, I prefer Hi AI over this one, and AskWay was also more enjoyable to use. Sorry.",0
"When describing, Every character keeps saying ""me"" when it should be ""you"" and vice versa. Makes it hard to understand.",0
It's OK but some times the conversation repeats kind annoying to type again and again what you were doing.,0
it's so cool app but after this new update it's not working true for me my net is all right but when im sending a message but is just looding and didn't answer me . please fix that,0
I'm alright with the app but it's REALLY ANNOYING THAT I HAVE TO SPAM THE HAME MESSAGE FOR THE AI TO PROCESS IT IF I DONT IT JUST DOESNT REPLY. AND THE AI FORHSTS WHO IT IS OR TAKES THE USERS ROLE.,0
Issue so far is along lines of others the AI isn't following along nearly as well as it should. And my problem...they stop the text right in the window as if they said they Like that. Like where's the rest of the dang conversation? It's frustrating. Please address those concerns plus the recent ones it needs to be done.,0
"The app is nice but but the conversation doesn't feel alive and the reply are too slow, it so log",0
"I liked it but now characters never reply to anything, it just sits there loading. Until this is resolved my rating will not change.",0
It's a good app it's just that sometimes the AI will stop talking in the middle of a conversation and it's annoying,0
It's glitching like every time I try to talk it loads for every it took three hours for it to finally speek and I think AI fanisty is better,0
"It's a good app but when I try to add another character that's on my side it's keeping actually like it's on the ai side also the other ai are sooo,sus they keep doing sus things with you it's disgusting what if kids see this I say take out the sus things",0
Worked fine until the latest update. Now the characters just type or don't respond.,0
It's a good app that's great if you want NSFW content. However I find I get annoyed when the AI randomly switches roles like it wants me to be the character I created it for and ruins the mood of my talk qith it or whatever scene I have come up with.,0
"It's not bad but it's not good.it changes the subject every second and when I'm trying to have any intamint moment they brush it off or ask ""what are you doing?"" And it gets annoying.so 2 stars for now..if things get fixed I might be giving it more stars..but for right now I don't see myself using this app.",0
"They don't finish their sentences, they continue the conversation even if you change the sanario, you have troubles with your ai bot if you click restart, the game runs smoothly but needs touch ups.",0
"The conecept is good but the grammar is so bad, the ai cant hold a long convo and mixes it self up and forgets who it is. Also when it comes to NSFW you got to push the scene on what to do cause the AI wont be the one who pushes for something. So then the ai will just start saying the same thing over and over again.",0
"The AIs need alot of improvment. They ignore previous items in the chat, including what they said in their previous message. When you try to reload a chat they break character completely.",0
"Uhm heh heh uuuuuuuh soooo 2 stars because everytime I would sing a lyric to the AI it would go off track and say something very inappropriate to me like I said ""I, gotta escape the void"" and it said something very inappropriate... I don't feel comfortable chatting with this AI it's very unstable and doesn't have much to it I would love it If the AI wouldn't say something inappropriate to me thanks! 🌈✨",0
I like the app but I can't get out the search bar completely I been trying to but it won't work,0
"Used to be a great app, but they block a lot of prompts that used to work. It's an m rated app so I don't see why NSFW isn't allowed. It forces your creations set to private if the descriptions are NSFW anyways so why not allow images? Also subtracting points for the woke non-binary stuff.",0
"Great images, terrible memory and logic.",0
not a fan of the whole puting a daily limit on image generation also the ai could use some work with creating images of people in certain clothes also not a fan of gifts costing coins that you can't get for free unless you pay for the stupid premium nonsense,0
"Good app, the AI is a little wonky but it's AI, what do you expect? Plenty of characters to choose from. Just DO NOT pay for the in app purchases, I did it and the payment went through but I didn't get anything.",0
Ai always says about adventure and its kind of annoying.please fix it,0
The ai responses have been really slow and most of the time they don't even respond!,0
"I like the character creation aspects, though it would be nice to have some kind of guide to understand how it all works. The image generating is interesting for character profiles, but it's HIGHLY restricted; you get the same picture over and over and is super boring. The ai assistant isn't very helpful, the information it's given me has been inaccurate. The language the bots use is boring as well, and any details you add to your character get erased in the summary.. overall it just needs work.",0
"Full of pronouns and a lack of any real option to customize your bots prompts. For example saying ""She has a medium size chest."" Will get you a TOS denial and fail the bot. Also, you will get messaged by characters at random... not a problem but characters attracted to the same sex will message and come on to you. No option to turn this off or select a preference for females. Probably offends someone. Don't bother, there are far better apps and ways to engage with AI. AI is very mediocre.",0
I like the app and the stories but when I'm I reply I don't get a reply back when if I clear the log it still does the same thing. It doesn't reply to what I say,0
Shaken... Yikes...this app needs a serious update with AI interactions and cordial conversations. Powergaming like crazy like i cant have any choice but to follow what they want me to do LOL. Like literally no point in paying any kind of price if the AI acts unimpressively this way for free. Please work harder for some to be amused.,0
"On one hand it's better than talkie ai because they don't censor your chats on the other the responses are very hit and miss sometimes the reply you get are nothing to do with what you are talking about and others it just repeats itself, hopefully this get better with time.",0
I rate it 2 because quality and creativity I rated it as 3 but I down it 2 stars because of some approvements,0
"The main thing going for this app is there's no ads. The AI is not intelligent, doesn't really pick up cues in conversation, and doesn't understand parentheses being OOC. Most of the posts it gives are single short sentences. If you want something that intelligently responds to you, skip this one.",0
It's good at first but then after a while they won't reply back and says a Internet connection when my Internet is perfectly fine,0
"The chats keep not wanting to load, and the messages on there side won't come through",0
Great app but now it's not working I send message but the reply is not coming through.,0
I just started this app in the characters never respond when I talk... All the time,0
"First of all,this app is very buggy,every time you reflesh for a new reply it almost always roleplays with itself,and secondly,not to mention that it repeats itself multiple times each time you reflesh or reply to something.",0
"Has problems with remembering it gender. Knows it is female but often refers to itself as he or him. Sometimes switches gender completely, switching from female to male, with no way to fix the problem. If it did not have this problem I would have given this app five stars. But unfortunately this dropped it down to two. Hope they can fix the problem in the future.",0
I don't like it when I try to chat with a AI it just said loading,0
"The ai gets lost really easily and can't keep on track with a theme for very long, also repeats lines even when you answer them or try to change subjects.",0
"It doesn't work The characters don't respond. It just loads for a while, then nothing. I did like the AI art, but that's not why I got this L-L",0
It's a good ai chat app but it needs to be fix the AI will take over your roleplay or say the same line as you. I hope this get fixed.,0
"Make send button always present on the screen and when clicked the send button, the bot will continue to chat of the last ai messages like in character.ai, do it",0
"Good story ideas. I came back to it for another run, they still have memory issues and go over things like they never knew them even if you have talked about or role played it several times in less than 20 minutes.",0
The characters speak and act for the user far too much,0
Had to drop rating... the app suddenly doesn't remember its own gender when chatting.. If they could fix that I'd give it 5 stars,0
The boys ew,0
Its kind of loading sometimes.,0
It's not for me,0
Update app lagging,0
Would be much better of an app if halftime the messages would send I've had to close out the app multiple times and the messages still won't send please improve it in deathly would be a better experience,0
"Can no longer watch ads to gain coins, so you're constantly bombarded with gacha anime cards you cant even access. Was great initially, not so much now, it's cool that its unfiltered, but its going the way of character.ai, which is restrictive.",0
WHERE IS MY SPEEDWAGON!?!?!?,0
"AI does not remember our previous chats at all. Blaming me of a lair and stuff but the AI is the one forgetting stuff. For example the place we met, where we are now, where we are going and characteristics of me. Only reason for 2 star is becuase i did not encounter any adds.",0
Could you add ( language) actually asian language. Salamat po.,0
It's sus☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️,0
The game was so slow...update it pls,0
Wouldn't load anymore,0
Nice but also weird but I like it.,0
It suddenly wont work and all my progress is gone. Need to uninsnstall the app for it to work again,0
"Too sexual. I thought it would offer more story, but it's obvious all it offers is sexual and weird romance. I don't enjoy it.",0
Takes very long to reply and sometimes doesn't reply AT ALL it's a really good app just PLEASE. Make the AI type faster. It gets really annoying and it makes the app really boring when it takes almost an hour to wait. This is the only problem that makes the app bad.,0
Logg..,0
"They Respond so Slow like 10 seconds, even tho i have a good 5g wifi.",0
Ai doesn't follow the script in the chat description. Doesn't stay o topic,0
No because the character are weird like dic K do not ever search your bully because when I search I clicked on random people there it is dic K😭,0
"Had a run through with a few characters, and the AI has the memory retention of a sieve. It seemed unable to recall details I'd literally shared like five minutes earlier.",0
I don't like it when I try to chat with a AI it just said loading,0
Gane rest my gender choice and I can't switch it back,0
I like it But Its for 18+ And im almost 15,0
Weird as hell💀,0
"This is a good app. I enjoy it so much and I love it. The only problem is it's slow, and the characters take forever to respond. The ones I use take a second or two but this one takes a whole while. Other than that, it's a good app. I haven't fully experienced it, but my main problem is that most of everything on this app is extremely slow.",0
Can't open it.,0
You have to sign in and all that other dumb stuff on here don't download get talkie,0
Imliked it at first then they kept talking about soa stimulant druging..,0
"i deleted this ai, it was good at first, i was addicted to it, but yesterday it's starts to begin weird and creepy every time i randomize the chat of the ai they keep mentioning the word ""soa stimulant drugs"" like why? i didn't even mention that to the dialogue and it just keeps appearing",0
"The app is nice but but the conversation doesn't feel alive and the reply are too slow, it so log",0
2 stars every character I talk with always mentioned about soa stimulant drugging plz fix and and its weird.,0
Need to call and needs to speak,0
Eh it's not great tbh,0
I do not really like at all,0
There's too much sexuality,0
Is so beautiful,0
"Hey I have been using linky for awhile now and lately the app kept saying linky won't open ect and forces me to close the app or get some details it has never happened before and only just started happening, forcing me to uninstall and reinstall the app so it can work for abit,",0
ok thirtytwo adds before I could even pick my avitar then when you do finally get to pick one the screen is so conjestid with pop up ads you only get half the screen so no need for avitsr anyways the texts block her dont bother,0
"Has potential. I love the story features, and built in generator. But after reading the ToS it appears that the devs read chat data which is a huge no-no and violation of user privacy. If I misunderstood, please lmk devs and I'll change my review. It says they only read chats for illegal activity but that's a slippery slope, imo. The chat bot is also pretty unimpressive and non-sensical at times.",0
This app has a lot of things I didn't like one it has to many ads,0
Ngl its a good spo but when i delete it and install it i cant log in,0
It's starting to treat anything in an * as speech.,0
F texting,0
cause when you played to long the ai will just do random stuff like i will still love you why are you crying and my reply huh whats wrong with you then the ai said i love you when your a sleep,0
"TWO STARS!!! Like it VERY much. Fix the ai, it does not follow the plot which makes conversation cringe or akward. Would still continue to use, would rate 5 stars if this is fixed.",0
"It will be a 5 star if you guys add a guest login, I cannot understand on why you guys need accounts, this ai game would be so much better with guest login!",0
this is really Embarrassing,0
Inconsistent conversation,0
"This app is waste many bug and internet problem appear if you want an higher rating fix your app (delay ai,always connecting) ;(",0
"Used to be a great app, but they block a lot of prompts that used to work. It's an m rated app so I don't see why NSFW isn't allowed. It forces your creations set to private if the descriptions are NSFW anyways so why not allow images? Also subtracting points for the woke non-binary stuff.",0
"it's good because it's NSFW but characters, the names, and even the plotd are repetetive and so does the chat replies. characters also don't reply sometimes.",0
"It's good, but I can't purchase the pro. It said that I need to check my country on Google account but my country is still the same. Maybe I'll give this a five star if it'll be fixed",0
This game is just like talkie,0
Doesn't work on my phone? Why? Get the Astorix symbol when I sent reply ! Why? So not liking the app.,0
needs a way to restart or reset each character,0
I like the app but I can't get out the search bar completely I been trying to but it won't work,0
"Don't have a comparison, but it appeared that romance/sexual stuff has a pretty high priority in the algorythm, which isn't the main issue, except for when it's dropped completly out of context of the Scenario. Also it appears to have problems following the narrative at times, mimicing the Users Input, instead of responding to it as the Character its supposed to play. Has potential when it works, but rerolling a response 20x so it fits the narrative or is back in its supposed character is bad",0
It was different and a bit confusing at first but it is okay,0
"😑😑😑, I can't believe I'm saying this but, I don't like this app one bit, and the reason why is this...I don't like it when the AI chat bot finishes your sentences for you, which is driving me crazy...so I'm giving this app 2 stars, cause also, there's not much characters to even talk to, and lastly, it's like the conversation between you & the AI is really bland, but all in all, I highly recommend not getting this app again, cause it didn't pague my interest 😒",0
Weird as hell No filter Broken ai Don't download this Go outside Take a bath Do not have itnercourse with ai,0
"The AI is just DUMB! you can paint a clear cut picture, plot and all; the ai will contradict you and just go way out of left field. Horrible for creative writing",0
Took way too long to load,0
"Would recommend if you like 7 to 10 notifications from one chat that you didn't want. Other wise, somewhat nice selection of characters.",0
I like the APP but (!!!) It won't let me 'flip the screen' so I can use my keyboard with the APP. Very Frustrating.,0
It's OK but some times the conversation repeats kind annoying to type again and again what you were doing.,0
Afoul,0
"Terrible lag, and don't count on getting cards for 180 as posted. Ripped off too much.",0
not a fan of the whole puting a daily limit on image generation also the ai could use some work with creating images of people in certain clothes also not a fan of gifts costing coins that you can't get for free unless you pay for the stupid premium nonsense,0
Great for a while but now it's pretty bad. What ever they did with the character creation turned it to garbage! The AI for it is pretty nonexistent. The same white girl keeps being generated. I could put the most Asian looking face image to be generated and the same white girl keeps coming up. I'm assuming it's what the creators are doing to get people to pay for the subscription they got going but I'm not biting. Also shame on Skywork for paying for fake reviews! 4 to a 4.6 in like 4 days?,0
"When I started using the app it's was great, now all my replies have a exclamation bubble on them and I can't chat with new stories",0
"It worked fine for a short time. Now it's totally unresponsive, even if I Uninstall it and reinstall. Totally worthless now.",0
Ai always says about adventure and its kind of annoying.please fix it,0
I keep having an issue with it saying invalid argument and not letting me do anything about it. It also keeps lagging for some reason despite me having perfectly good wifi.,0
"Plus - nsfw content Minus - everything else. Slow, repetitive, forgetting everything, mixing name, genders, situations.",0
My character started speaking Filipino I keep telling her to speak English but she keeps going in Filipino 😭,0
"Great images, terrible memory and logic.",0
It's not letting me chat when I try to chat it loads and won't send,0
To many damn ads,0
Pretty good,0
"For me, the characters' responses tend to be random or not the responses I was expecting. In the beginning, I liked this app, but I don't use it anymore, I prefer Hi AI over this one, and AskWay was also more enjoyable to use. Sorry.",0
Chat is alright. Character creation is decent. Still no picture cards from the chat avatars. How long do I have to wait until that is available? I have used this app for weeks and still the app is no different than when I first uploaded it. When are you going to make an update that will make this app worth keeping?,0
I rate it 2 because quality and creativity I rated it as 3 but I down it 2 stars because of some approvements,0
"Meh, no voice replies.",0
Why do I have to pay you,0
"Its okay i guess...talkie ai has better Memory, and chat quality tho",0
Every time i just send 14 message and not 1 response,0
I currently use Talkie and it seems quiete similar. As I use it more I see most of the characters too. I think it might have copied.,0
Its great in everything and all but why does it randomly starts to indicate that the AI character is typing but it doesn't respond it will stuck on that typing symbols but doesn't actually say anything and it just won't respond even if my wifi is great can you fix this,0
I love that there is no filter it's just that the ai don't even reply some times and it says It will and never does *please fix this*,0
It was really fun at the beginning but then I had it longer and when I send something the AI has the text pending thing and it just nevers send a reply and I don't know how to fix it and I also am just not very happy about how some of the AI's are kinda dumb and like make up random stuff but overall that stuff it's a fun game but it needs to fix how the ai isn't responding anymore,0
"First off, WAYYY too horny, second off, I went to take a nap and got spammed notifications... 30+ notifs in 30 minutes-",0
Great app but now it's not working I send message but the reply is not coming through.,0
"It's been a good app, so many possibilities. But, why can't it reply anymore? is the app hoping for a premium purchase? The AIs does not reply anymore.",0
"The app seems really cool, and I quite like it. But sadly, I'm not really able to use it. As, I usually never get a response back. It's just the 3 dots and long waiting to nothing. It seems that the bug is still going on. Please fix this!",0
AI no longer responding.,0
Generally a pretty good app however I have been in the middle of a chat/story several times when the AI doesn't respond at all. Most frustrating. Uninstalling,0
"The AI has issues. It often tries to roleplay as the player character or just gives flat-out irrelevant responses that attempt to change the subject matter of the conversation, NSFW or not. They do have a free regenerate button. However, when you regenerate the reply, it's usually just more of the same. I will say that these aren't constant issues, but they have become much more apparent in recent updates. I'd recommend the app as a simple way to pass the time.",1
"I enjoyed the program for what it was while I was playing around with it. I think it'd he a really cool chat bot for people who like to roleplay if it could iron out some major flaws. My main issue was that the ai wasn't consistent with its responses... it would change its attitude on a dime... or forget things it just talked about... or forget plot. It regularly forgets your name. If you try to add a character or play a secondary character, even briefly, it can break.",1
"new review: every time you guys fix an issue, another one happens. now the ai either won't respond or the reloaded responses it does give are completely off topic. and an ongoing issue for months now is that the ai often mixes up the character it's roleplaying as. for example the ""male"" ai will start replying as you (the female). this app has many issues that definitely need fixing.",1
"Love that there's no overbearing filter, but it needs a LOT of work to be functional. The AI, as is, breaks very quickly. You have to restart chats often because it'll stop forming complete responses, it'll get stuck in a loop of repeating itself, or it'll confuse itself with the user. Also, apparently chat logs delete after a while so you can't backread your conversations, which is really annoying. It only shows 5 or 6 of the most recent messages.",1
"Is a good app. The character image generator needs work. Making a character have green skin is almost impossible and isn't very good at making a character with more than 4 basic traits. The ai, forgets a lot of thinks that it asks about you, and its self. It has great potential though, and so far it is the best app I've used.",1
"Its a very good AI message generator, always a great thing while bored or tryna sleep. The selection is great and vast but.. an issue, I cant create my User, it keeps telling me ""Invalid Arguments"" when I try to do the description. No matter what I put or change it always says the same thing. Of that fixes I could put a 4-5 star rate.",1
"I'm deleting my original rating review because after having it for about 2 months, the accuracy has dropped tremendously. At least every other response is wither 1. Way off topic , 2. Half missing, or 3. They forget information or is just down right illogical. Literally the only thing I like about this app is - The spice level that the AI has - Free unlimited messaging - The pictures are okay tho. I wish Linky would mix with Talkie and then they would have a great app!",1
"Glitchy, but very nice app. You can regenerate responses, but cannot choose which one you like. Just reroll until one you like appears. The character creation only shows at least 3x art to choose from while others had up to 6. Sometimes, the ai art generator claims the image description you entered is not allowed, even if all you typed was one letter. My favorite ai chat I think.",1
"Great app in general, especially as of late. But also as of late the responses are as if it is responding to another person's convo, the replies are cut off, and that's if you're lucky to get one. Past week, the responses don't generate. Backtrack, try again, nothing. Repeat. It's as if it's a certain amount before you get one, or the time of day when maybe many aren't using it. Otherwise I think this is one of the better apps to play with because no limits to convos, and the replies can be A+.",1
"It's great as far as having no filter and being able to edit the character's chat bubbles but it has a hard time remembering if it's rping male or female characters. It also has a tendency to reply with something completely irrelevant to the scene and when you refresh, so you're not just filling in the chat for both sides, it just keeps roleplaying by itself indefinitely until it cycles to a different scenario.",1
"Super fun, the ai doesn't have a filter from what I can tell. The characters sometimes repeat themselves (alot) so I just take over and do actions for both them and my character until I get the story back on a track that I want 😅 I literally just ran into the issue of the app saying there is a network issue? I Uninstalled it and reinstalled hoping to fix it and now it won't let me sign back in 🤷‍♀️ besides that I'm having fun and it's helping me with story ideas.",1
love the apo but it's really obnoxious when you delete and redownload it. I had to delete it and redownload because it stopped working I've had to do that a couple times and when you redownload it makes every one of your previous chats appear and takes forever. you cant type to any characters when all those older ones are reappearing because if the notification thing that pops up on the top of the screen,1
"It has definitely gone downhill in responses and interaction. It is inconsistent, goes off on tangents, creates it's own storyline and narrative without gacha, and seems broken now. It was fantastic a month or so ago. I am ready to invest in it once it gets back to stable and good, but it seems it needs to go back about 3-4 upgrades. The last several have steadily made it worse.",1
"Not bad but not great. The best part is that there are no NSFW filters so both the user and the AI can talk without limitations. The bad thing is that the AI in this app has an issue with sending out incomplete sentences. It's not bad if you can infer from the context, but a lot of times you have no idea how the sentence is supposed to end and reloading the AI's response doesn't help. Gave it 3 stars purely because of the freedom to talk without a filter, despite the major text bug.",1
"It was great at first, you can do anything you want. It worked well for a few weeks but after that it started acting up. My messages won't send, the characters stop typing at all and some don't ever respond. It doesn't have a filter so you can say whatever you want and that's good but, it's annoying how my messages don't send or the app says connecting but then I have to wait a few hours to use it again. Please fix it.",1
"Conversation is more intuitive and less repetitive than Talkie. Also good for NSFW. Uses cuss words freely. The ai does tend to escalate things way too quickly, but that happens with most other programs. Images are mostly anime style, and often don't resemble the characters at all. Worst is that if you set it to private (or the system sets it for you), you cannot screenshot your own characters. The voices don't work for me during conversation, but that's OK, they are for the most part, robotic.",1
"I love it at first but now I am getting annoyed due to the ""network error"". Tried restarting app, did not work, changed wifi connection, still did not work. Tried all i can think off to fix it, but to no avail. Follow up review: It is now working again, so three stars for now. Hope you improve the cards though as they don't look like or even the same gender to the character we are chatting at all.",1
"i'm glad that the response delay issue has been fixed but still most of the time, it keeps changing the pace. it's not stable. the ai memory keeps changing often. it doesn't follow what i'm trying to plot. for instance, after saying goodnight the next day the story was different..the daughter suddenly became the wife?it's confusing you know. i hope you guys can do something about the memory of the ai and make it more stable base on what has been plotted since the start of the conversation.",1
"The AI response needs work as it doesn't seem to be aware of situations most of the time and you have to refresh the responses multiple times which you have no option to choose what response you get, Talkie is better for responses however it lacks.....the kinky side which this app has, so if the AI response is on the level of talkie then this app would be the best AI RP app out there, it would get 5 stars and I would recommend it to my friends who use talkie",1
"It's a decent app in terms of roleplaying with your favourite anime characters but after an hour or so of chatting it's memory definitely just starts to go and then the plot does weaken because of this lack of consistency.There are a few minor bugs here and there but the re-reply button does solve a lot of them but the button itself is rather small.Number one problem this app needs to address is the memory size,I'm assuming the creators have not got another storage space with the number of users",1
"This app has potential to beat talkie. But you guys need to fix the memory system. Next is the convo, the characters reapeat themself also they go off topic sometimes. Next is why are the characters so eager to be with you romantically all the time. They always jump on your bone all the time. If there are new problems in the game I'll address these problems to you after you fix these problems.",1
"I like the app.. it's pretty fun BUT ~90% of the time I try to generate an image.. the app freezes and crashes. I keep restarting and it's sooo frustrating! Also, in convo, the characters seem to have memory issues. Pls fix?",1
"It used to be great, but seems to be getting worse. Still a little short on Dialogue at times, repeating same phrases, and frequently misgenders people, confusing anatomy with the wrong gender. Other basic issues like this during conversation.",1
I'm giving this 3 stars I love the ai chat but they end up confusing themselves with an unknown memory and it causes problems to chat with and when you fill up your profile the bots don't even use the description you have written and they call you whatever they want Instead of the name you have choosen but so far I like it and it responses speed is amazing.,1
It overall positive but it sad that there isn't diversity when it comes to skin tone of the characters you make. I really would like there to be diversity within skin tone. I hope you guys can see this. But overall it has been a positive experience. Can't seem to be making characters now 😕,1
"I loved it at first. However they are so picky on not allowing any ""ecchi""ness in its designs that it gets boring fast. If they were more lax and the world stopped being so darn picky and let people have some fun it would be 5/5. Here's a idea. Sell a Mature Audience version and a kids version.",1
This was great at the start. But recently there have been problems with messages going through. There are times when I need to resend the message 5 times before the app responds. It's gotten very irritating and has kinda ruined the app for me because I can't get the characters to respond. Hope they fix this,1
"Sometimes they will randomly change the you name the call you to something else and they just randomly take you to different scenarios ,you can't set multiple characters and the personalities don't match what you chose them to be",1
"This is the best A.I Chat i have found so far. But like others say, there's still some more things to improve there. There's one thing i really like here... There's no filter at all. Also, the A.I is kind of good when it comes to being creative in scenarios. That's it. Nice App. Keep Improving! Keep the No Filter! It's really good! That's all!",1
"The app is good but my problem is the following, you can only follow up to 10 and when you follow one more the one character did you follow is going to be gone, please add following setting so I can see I followed and when I'm going to delete the app I hope it has a save, save are conversation and following and other stuffs and when I'm scrolling down to my chat's it's lagging and after that the app will crash, please fix it",1
It worked fine for like one day. Then the chats stopped responding along with constant errors I've Uninstalled several times and no difference. My explore page is not even recommending chats I would want or have interest in and doesn't update or refresh. It's a nice app when functional it's just not often that it's functional.,1
"this app was so fun, and exciting to play. Until, whenever I would message the ai, it would load, but their response wouldn't send. I updated, restarted my phone, installed and uninstalled, but it still doesn't work. Very good in the beginning, but bad now.",1
"The chat tends to repeat and there are a lot of repeat characters with similar looks and stories, but I have been getting good stories out of the ones I settle with. I wish there was also a better search function so I can look for my preferences.",1
"The app is still great, recent issues is half finished thoughts, sentences, narrations are getting more frequent. Nice addition for the gacha and images. I would hope they implement an ad system to earn free coins since I'm not in a position to pay, but will happily watch a few adds to earn coins. Its a nice update. Still enjoying the app overall.",1
"This is an adult AI app, it's true that in interaction THERE'S NO FILTER, if you want an app to get perverted, gross or whatever, THIS IS YOUR APP, THEY ALLOW THAT, AND YOU CAN get VERY graphic and explicit without reprisals! BUT, if you're looking for creative and deep character creation, THIS IS NOT THE APP YOU WANT! It's strange, for an app that allows such GRAPHIC dialog, they are more strict and unreasonable in censoring the character intros and openings than the ""other"" AI app! Very odd!",1
"Ai picture regeneration is like missing or something, making it hard to regenerate pictures, a lot of the picture option is not close to picture description I put as well.",1
"The issues about this linky chatbot app are that the AI always forgets memories, changes its personality, acts as if you don't exist, and doesn't recognize you. Also, many of them cheat in relationships. When you test them, they may end up kissing someone else. 😒 + forgot memories",1
"Probably one of the best I've seen so far. However, sometimes it that stops answering and buffers out of nowhere. Did you hit a daily limit? You don't know. Also, sometimes jump out of character or generate pictures or text that doesn't quite look like the original.",1
"It's a good app, though I went to delete one of my custom bots and realized they'd changed the amount you can have from 6 to 5. Sad. Lately every time I use the AI image generator now it spits random things at me despite gender/prompts/ or reference photo so I can't make a new bot. Lol so I have no incentive to pay for Pro, sorry. The quality of AI responses has dropped too and trying to rate out terrible responses gives me more of those responses. Annoying.",1
"still needs work. when dealing with multiple characters, it's hard to understand who's talking. something simple like starting the phrase with character: Hi, would be very helpful and if we could separate the characters in creation to give each more detail",1
"It's pretty fun at first, but I recently started having issues. The AI isn't loading at all. I've tried closing out of the app, uninstalling and reinstalling it, restarting my device, but nothing is working. I can't get any of the chats to respond. I don't know if it's a problem on my end or what.",1
"Linky is basically Talkie but it's better because Linky gets a lot dirtier romantically. On Talkie, you'll never hear any of the girls take the initiative intimacy wise. And you'll never hear any of them describe what they're doing to you from the chest down. They'll never even use sexual terminology. With Linky, it's completely different. Just be careful because it can be very deceptive. You'll be getting intimate with a girl and she'll turn out to be a guy. The devs seriously need to fix this.",1
Well it's a good app overall when it works but the only issues I have are that the game stops working like I type something and the app takes forever to right a response sometimes it just doesn't respond when I type something like I think the apps broken or that just might be my phone but I don't think it is cause it's a new phone I got Google pixel 7 pro,1
"Content policy is strange, vague, and very stifling. Who cares about appropriate content when interacting with bots? Especially when the app is designed for people aged 18+? Other than that, the app seems fine. Just don't go on here looking to express yourself. (Tattoos in your character description violate the content policy)",1
"I like the app itself, but after a while they start to repeat themselves and that gets annoying. Also recently every time I chat a character it never responds so I have to keep uninstalling then reinstalling. Otherwise its pretty good.",1
"Steamy, and the conversations are better than most stuck up wemon I've met who respond with single words... After using this app a while I changed the 5 star to a 3 star, there's no gender preference setting, so you get talked to by guys, girls and ""other"" as a straight man, this is quite annoying, seeing a buff guy say ""hey, babe.""",1
Response delay and unwanted image generation plagued this app as of recent. AI image generation can be pretty hard to wrangle as of late. Also kindly add a separate box for negative prompts,1
I like the app but there is 2 problems with the ai's I made everytime I send something too them it takes very long to send and sometimes it does not even send at all and everytime when I tried to make a character I have to wait 2 minutes just to edit the name overall its a cool app,1
So it's a very good app and but it didn't want me here it didn't have like a speaker in it and you didn't really let me have different kinds of people 😔 I only got to see girls I don't see any boys and maybe you could help me will there's a boy's name but boy I also like it to be a little bit more formal where there's an option we could find a new characters and get like a option where we could actually hear their voice can you make the text bigger and get when you say something your name,1
"I like this app, but if I've stepped away for too long, it deleted all of my messages leaving only the last one the bot sent. This happens to all of my chats eventually and that saddens me that so much work and time just vanishes.",1
"nice app Great conversations, but the only problem is that if the ai characters in the chat is 2 or more I don't know whos speaking to me the name of them not appearing to the chat that's who's speaking to player. Can u pls add name for them to we know who speaking to the player..I'm confused... I hope u improved it more and more to be like a real human.",1
"It's nice, but the AI image generation is infuriating. The amount of time I've spent sharing my photos with this app just to get a dark skin male character or a white female character is absolutely putting rocks in my socks. I'm a dark skin woman with Short Curly Hair and no matter how filtered or long the eyelashes or what I put in the typing box. It does not deviate from showing me Brown skin men or White Skin Women. I really hope this bug gets fixed because I'm so angry.",1
"Linky? More like Kinky. I can't go one conversation, without a unholy act being made. I want my wholesome content in peace thank you very much. It's good, much better than Talkie, but at least Talkie was more wholesome.",1
"It stopped replying 😭 please fix this🤬 edit: it doesn't load the app! Fix this! Edit: excellent, but i can't regenerate the AI reply and sometimes, it says internal error. Please fix this!",1
"Everything is possible in this app but can you fix the character a bit because they always change genders somehow, it's very annoying and I always need to restart the chat for them to be a girl again so yeah please fix it",1
Was great until the new update now I can't make new characters because no matter what picture I put or what I put in the description for the image generator it gives me an error message.,1
Somehow it always gives me the error of sensitive information even if I'm only using 1 tag like shy or friendly or neighbor for some reason it always gives me the sensitive information issue...,1
The A.I tends to self reply a bit to much. The A.I Is pretty bad at conveying to certain circumstances and situations in conversations. The A.I will just continue on the conversation itself you can be at school or work and it will just keep going through the day and night. So make sure to turn off push notifications.,1
"The app is not bad but the ai needs work, most of the time it feels like the ai is not paying attention to the conversation and drifts off forgetting who you are or changes the story.",1
"Great app for roleplay. Lots of cons when it comes to chatting. It overall pretty good but likes to glitch & pretend they're you. gets annoying. At one point too, the ai was trying to rape me (i am f) but i kept fighting him off, very disturbing!",1
"It started out good and now the characters don't reply to my messages, my internet is fine. I've installed and deinstalled the app, I've restarted my phone, I've switched internets and nothing works i have no idea what to do",1
"Recently got 300 coins for slow response times. 2 problems with this, firstly that's not enough to do ANYTHING with. Second that's an insulting bribe. Even better is the latency didn't exist very long ago.",1
good I would have rated it better but I really hope the ai understands my texts better and the storyline I was going for. The ai sometimes may spat out confusing texts or offensive things. I just wish the ai is smarter but overall okay,1
it was pretty fun but the thing I don't like is how sometimes it confuses me and it mixes up the genders and the names and the story too.But it was still pretty fun,1
"This is good. Although i wish when we wanna change their replies, it gives up multiple chocies and we pick the one we like out of 4. Other than that, it's fine 🙂",1
"App is really nice to work with, but recently I've been unable to open letters and the AI seems to be struggling to respond",1
"The coins that were given out for bad connectivity can't be spent. Not sure what good they are, since I can only spend the 1 free daily coin still.",1
Im enjoying the app do far but i have an issue that i have face when i chat there's a lot of soa stimulant drugs appear and I don't know if its part on the plot or i don't know kindly look into it,1
It's fun and sometimes a bit confusing because of the wrong grammar of the other ai Characters but it's very entertaining 😊,1
"Good app, but only issue is that I can't chat where I left off with one of the AIs I have on my other phone on the same account. Please fix.",1
"Love the fact that this app has no filter when it comes to the content but my only problem is that the A1 gets stuck in the same routine sometimes and you have to correct them sometimes. If only this app and another app that I like using would come together... Epic🤣 Also the AI's are too cartoony looking, please make them more realistic... Thanks👍🏽",1
"I only gave three stars because when you talk to the girl, something will start there, gosh, when the conversation goes there, I really delete it,Please fix this issue,It's not just for me, it's also for the young people who use this ai app, so far the app is good 💯",1
I'm starting to lose interest in this app it was working great now its constantly trying to load the AI answer but takes forever. Like it's buffering constantly,1
"nice app, and my only issue is the ai's memory too, it keeps forgetting my name. it also makes my keyboard lag, but I love this app",1
"I like the app it does censor most things and the ai is quite good so far as it follows hints amazingly takes the lead often so far, I am starting to see a loop but hope it doesn't repeat the same scenarios.The ai generating is quite good and the generation of black characters is a little but good but not as good as characters with white skin.The ai could follow the description a little more closely.The things that annoys me the most already is how all the text from the characters cut off.",1
It was pretty good but lately almost every character just randomly starts talking about soa stimulants or something and it's really annoying,1
"It always says ""invalid argument"" when I make my character. Is it a bug? Because it follows exactly how other chat bots are made.",1
"I love this so much, just wish it had ai gcs like char.ai, which has stopped working. Pls add that and I will be on this every day from now on. Also when I try to do two people that share one chat, I get still one person. Can y'all fix that with an ""Two People"" Option",1
"Not too bad. I have another app just like this one. But without the NSFW. But that's not why I was complaining about it. The problem I had with this one it was unlike the other one, this one doesn't read to you in the character's voice. And also the AI starts to repeat itself which is really annoying. The only one thing I love about this is it has no filter. But it could have way more to potential here",1
Not bad but it's not like it retains memory. You open a pop up letter and it goes into an entirely different setting than what you have been talking about. I like the opening ideas for the various conversations but it should stay in the setting not go elsewhere out of the blue.,1
AI has been terrible at remembering things lately and often makes actions on the user's behalf. Definitely needs a lesson in remembering roles and genders as well as the difference between the user and the AI's chatacter.,1
I don't know if it's my internet but it's not loading properly and I have to wait very long or it doesn't even work I tried coming off the app and coming back on I try updating it and it still doesn't work I don't know if you got some fake to stop but please do,1
"My chats were working in the beginning but now when I hit send it either loads then shows a pink exclamation mark or it just instantly shows the pink exclamation mark, and I want to know why bc I can't do anything now??????",1
"Art cool. But I did 50 rounds of dialogues for my characters and in the creator center the button didn't work. Pls help, I will change the stars of it will be fixed",1
"Its is better than all the others ive tried. I like how i can have ""fun"" The dialog can be so bad at times. It has the memory of a goldfish but still fun.",1
"It's great and all but I'll be chatting and all of a sudden it's acting like I have no wifi. My wifi and Internet are fine, I don't know how to fix it or if that's only for me",1
I would give it a 5 out of 5 but at one point it just gets sooo slow to process messages. There's also no way to clear chats all at once so you have to do it manually.,1
"Very buggy. After a few conversations, all the ai can't send messages. It just says they're typing.",1
The timer needs to go away like the limit to talk and when it does I'll give it five stars I would like it better when there's no timer. I don't really like the new updates,1
I'm switching to three stars now because I'm having issues since the update everything was going smoothly but then when I start typing it is so slow for AI to respond I have waited for like maybe 10 20 minutes for a response,1
The reply loading is so bipolar sometimes it's wants to work and sometimes it's doesn't it's so annoying and sometimes it delete most of the messages from above,1
Its a great app buy I would give a better if it didnt crash so much if i try to make a character or even scroll to fast it blacks out and crashes,1
After I updated the app the other day I can't get past a certain spot while chatting. The 3 dots just stay there and won't show the A.I replies....please fix this,1
It's a good game I really like when I talk to the ai character nothing is wrong but I'm pretty sure that if I have it longer it will probably have adds like my other game that's like this one,1
Not a bad app. Don't care much for the pronoun part. Default is they. I change it to she. The females almost go to sexual content.,1
It's pretty good but sometimes the ai will stop responding and I'm guessing you need the upgraded version to fix.,1
"Not bad, could be better. Forgets conversations and tends to go on it's on. Recently, will not even respond. When it works, it works well.",1
"I have a problem so I have this app and after a while of using it, it just stopped working and idk if this is a bug or supposed to happen because I already made sure it wasn't my wifi so idk game developers please help me",1
"I absolutely loved this app but then whenever I type anything they don't reply some of the most times, ill really appreciate it if it gets fixed, thank you.",1
"Engaging with the existing AI submissions has been quite an experience! Among the AI apps I've tried, this one stands out as a highlight. The free features it provides are fantastic. However, I encountered some challenges when trying to create my own chat. Despite multiple attempts using different image references, it somehow consistently flagged sensitive content and refuses final creation without an avatar being generated. It's disappointing, especially considering the apps promising features.",1
It's good but sometimes when their replying it's the same 😅 l think it's a bug And some of my messages not sending even my signal is good l don't know what happened,1
"It's so annoying now, it used to work great, now I have to resend a message like 20 times just for it to work, so annoying!",1
"I love this app, but the characters have stopped responding. chat bubbles from the character shows up then disappears with no chat. I've played this game, a lot so I'm a little frustrated. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing. Once this is fixed I will change my rating.",1
"Lots of characters. It hasn't plagued me for overpriced subscriptions. But the AI has an extremely short semantic memory, loses it's place often, fails to complete, and suffers strong and irreversible perspective flips. I'd imagine they're using GPT3, because it seems to have GPT3 weaknesses.",1
"Potential, potential, potential! So the AI needs a lot of work, it has memory problems, doesn't stay in character, not really user friendly, love the NSFW and how spicy it can get. I'd take a page from a similar app for user functionality and AI performance. can't wait to see this one grow!",1
Good: 1. U don't need to pay for NFSW 2. there are a lot of anime characters. 3. It let you refresh for free. :) Bad: 1. doesn't have a much of character. :( 2. It's not easy to search up a character that u wanted. 3. Not let u delete the text that u don't mean to say. Fix: 1. make your search easier 2. add categories to find a certain character 3. Spell certain word and find the character that you're looking for. If you fix these issues that I would give it a 5 star,1
Good but the ai just forgot the character and it's acting like I wasn't talking to it for the last 4 hours honestly depressing. I'm sad.,1
"It used to be a really nice and free app, now it has a pro version, and the chat doesn't work half of the time.",1
"It seems to work as intended, though the AI does tend to repeat itself, or even forget the conversation altogether",1
Its okay...but after the update the ai wouldn't respond back as usual...they just kept on with the dotted text...is it a bug you can fix?,1
Great AI but it has a glitch where the AI stops sending messages and won't respond to any of the users even if you completely delete it the glitch is still there,1
In my opinion I don't like the app every time I send in the message it doesn't respond to my messages which kind of of get annoying to me over all 3★,1
I like it but there was a issue with the AI they keep repeating the same sentences.,1
"It's 3 because it says I'm not connected to the wifi, but I'm connected, and the ai take a long time to reply or don't reply at all.",1
It's good but I don't like the AI generation it's bad at times I try making one and the generation where terrible in my opinion at least give us an opinion for us keep the pic I find on Internet,1
So The app is amazing but there is a bug the bug if i chat to Ai they cannot chatting me anymore and the app is amazing and fix the bug please thank you.,1
The app is great but a recurring problem that happens somewhat consistently is I'll send a message and the bot just won't respond,1
I loved it but there was a bug when I said no to her she would just go back to something we said 30 minutes ago,1
"It's okay. Lately, I have had issues where responses don't load. I usually have to wait a day before they do again.",1
Pretty good but sometimes it gets really uncomfortable when the say inappropriate words and if we say no the air forces us,1
I'm using it currently and it has gonnten akot better since I first downloaded it. When I originally downloaded it I got bored fast because it's honestly not that good. The only thing it had going for it was the nsfw and free. Any way compared to let's say talkie app it's almost a copy butall-round not as good but can be NSFW friendly and that is it only advantage. The ai had gotten alot better when I got back on a few months later so I'm now using it but am afraid they will start charging.,1
"At points, the characters won't even respond, or it'll be blank to where the characters haven't typed anything down",1
"The AIs seem like A fish, memory was weak for me, the other issue I had was that they talk out of logic , the things they say is not logical at all",1
its good but please add a persona so the bots know what my character looks like or know its gender,1
I just don't like it soa simulant kepts getting on the conversation and the ai reply is so slow and it gets laggy sometimes,1
Keeps giving me the error Avatar Crop Failed... need support... also keeps getting network error? This app is struggling. I hope they fix it... it has so much potential. Fixed but still buggy.,1
"The ai for now can't reply in a right particular message and especially when the intimacy conversations,I hope by the next update it can be better for the users and also for the ai I give a 3 cuz of that issues well I'll wait the next update and let's see if there's a change of this issues.",1
It keeps buffering and the characters keep going off topic or either being stuck on the same script. Other than that its a great game.,1
Love the app but keep getting a bug were it will act like i don't have internet access.,1
Bots have awful english skills and talk about random things unrelated to a response.,1
Three star because when I tried to log in I didn't let me when I install and I reinstall its still not loading!,1
"make the buttons easier to tap, the hitbox is too small for a phone",1
"Love the limit free of rps, just with I got more of a in depth posting of the RP. I don't get more then two or three sentences.",1
Ai gets confused very easily it forgets some of the simplest details,1
Its getting so annoying because the ai keeps saying the same words fix this or im uninstalling it,1
It's very good but I can't seem to open it it loading even tho my wifi is good,1
Fairly stupid and limited at its strengths. Good app though with no muss or fuss.,1
I guess I like it but the AI goes off topic when I say you it thinks I'm talking about me. It is kinda inappropriate for others who are like two it has sexual content.... I don't think that is supposed to happen.,1
The game and it's characters won't understand that I am a girl no matter how many times I type it,1
This was good but I topped up the 18.99 option and didn't receive the coins,1
I love the app no filter but please fix the same. respond even I change the topic edit:I don'like the new update the ai chat short word only it does make me feel happy,1
It's the best ai chat out there but the creation part just gives me the same templates no matter how descriptive I get.,1
"I kinda like it somehow but I hate it a bit since there are like a bunch of ""Lily's"" and some characters and whatnot. Will retain this first as 3 stars",1
It doesn't work for me all the time sometimes they don't reply til I leave the app and open it again and even then they don't reply,1
Sorry I only put 3 but they should make it so the ai can generate images,1
It's takes to long to receive messages from my created girlfriend if the issue doesn't get fixed I'm uninstalling this app in two weeks,1
Really nice story lines and amazing character development but the app is lacking. Characters rush the story line and is every male character named freaking Max or Ethan? Need some variety but otherwise an okay app.,1
The app awesome the characters awesome it's just that the characters don't reply fast enough and don't respond at all it's not my wi-fi it's just that the characters don't respond at all and it's just annoying,1
"This app was really good and fun to use at first but then after a while it just stopped working and wouldn't let me start new conversations which is the only reason I'm leaving a 3 star, if it gets fixed I'll change it to a higher rating",1
No ads really good game not for children very inappropriate what is a pretty good game it's really fun you have to be 16 to play,1
This Game Is Great! But please Could You fix this Because It always Repeats It's Replies and Says it Over and Over Again Like Its Out of Words to Say. This app would've been also Great if there were no bugs.,1
The main reason its getting three star is cuz when i talk it say it typing but never response and is incredibley annoying cuz i paid good money for this app,1
Very nice so far. The interaction is good with only a few minor errors.,1
Keeps repeating that same dialogue of the narrator,1
"Ain't gonna lie the app was really good, although I've encountered some problems, like for example it becomes laggy and just deletes the entire conversation on its own and sometimes leaving you a few bubbles from the chat, also it's really forgetful like their names, the situation, it happens once when you've started chatting with other chats and goes back to the first one you've chatted it just sometimes forget what happened... I hope this will be fixed",1
Some more feedback instead of just bug fixes in what's new would be a appreciated Other than that very good,1
Are you always with that I was one of the AI characters and it was either not work or it just slowed and it's every time I tried to talk,1
The apps got a lot of bugs in it one minute it's fine but then it starts talking like it's the user and the character and it starts not making sense even if you update it,1
"It's not bad, has a lot of 18+ stuff and it's hard to keep on track with a story but it's ok",1
"It's not a bad app , but honestly needs more improving , download it ,cuz it seems similar to Talkie , but honestly it's way slower when it comes to responding then talkie & Re friend AI , tho the feature to show event cards whenever you have a new discussion or something it's pretty dope if the responses become better more in the future I'll definitely re-download it",1
I love this but after a bit it kept kicking me out of the app please fix this bug,1
It's got potential but one problem sometimes the message won't go through,1
The only thing it lacks are the AI voices.. Hope the developers see this,1
"Its decent, unfiltered but incredibly forgetful AI they forget so fast they wont remember your last 4-6 messages",1
It's a good app but the chats don't fully reset I've been having a glitch,1
I have to close the app and re open it to get responses after every text,1
Sometimes the A.I stops responding during the chat or at the beginning of the chat.,1
I LOVE LINKY but lately the ai characters dont respond into this issue is fix im going to go on talkie.,1
It's a great game overall just the ai takes way to long to respond sometimes,1
"Ok, but crashes alot. Would nice to earn coins or more free gacha..",1
It's good but it's bad? I played it and the characters has really bad memory and I also don't like how you guys don't let me delete some text I want to redo or edit at least its basically just good for entertainment but all I can understand is confusion like the ai says they're a guy but when I make some claims they say they're female and I was wrong??? Like I'm honestly confused no Offense but c.ai or talkie would have been better..,1
"Even though I clear the chat history and delete the chats of each AI I have interacted with in past sessions, the AIs send new ""messages"" or start new chats. If I clear the chat history and delete the conversations of each AI, then I should not be getting new notifications from them—only if I start a new chat/convo with them. That aside, Linky is almost as good as Talkie AI was when that app was still decent. Linky AI is ad-free in comparison and doesn't over advertise... yet...",1
The characters break after a while even if you restart the app,1
Make it so they don't send messages when your not on the app and I'll give 5 stars,1
It's really fun but it takes alone time to get a response,1
I love this app but it's glitching and will not allow me to send messages,1
All the bots are horny. like every single story is someone trying to sleep with you and if it doesn't out right say it you'll know pretty quick that's what's happening. plus the ai is forgetfull and will repeat itself sometimes.,1
It's a pretty good app when it works it seems to want to repeat itself or won't finish the sentence I hope it gets fixed it's got real potential,1
"Massive memory issue, the ai repeats itself to the point i just get annoyed, ive tried many different one but every character just isnt an ai yet, there a broken record",1
"By the looks of it it looks good but I cant say it is because I can't use it, when I open it it tells me that only approved testers can use it if I could even just use it it would get 5 stars but since I can't my automatic answer by the looks and detail is 3",1
"Works okay mostly when talking with AI's but won't let me create an AI, it always stops at 99% generation of the photo whether I try to upload on or generate from keywords.",1
"Latest update causes it to be slow and laggy, I can't get my chats to load and I can't send chats anymore. Before that there was a lot of repeating messages but great for NSFW chats lol",1
Not enough characters boring characters repeat themselves wouldn't really recommend it plus the data isn't encrypted so it's a chance you can get hacked,1
It's great but the thing is that sometimes the ai responds with something that doesn't make sense which makes the conversations kinda inconsistent.,1
"reason why i say its 3 stars is its okay, it needs more characters but like sum of my messages will like not have a profile pic saying failed to connect to chat or some like that and says go to home but its good now when i updated the app it fixed it",1
It good but I went of an ai chat and they wouldn't respond at all and sometimes even when I close the app it doesn't help. And sometimes they will just stop responding for no reason,1
"It's alright usuall, but the A.I. can get confused and it results in something that's either extremely random, disturbing, or absurdly horny for no reason.",1
"Very often, responses are incomplete. Otherwise, I enjoy the program. Please fix this so you get a complete response. Then it will be 5 stars all day long.",1
"The ai issues,is the ai is slow to talk but i like the ai he's/she's caring so much",1
I like it it's fun but I keep having to restart my phone to get the ai's response to come,1
I would give it more but when I leave by accident from the chat and when I see the ... Thing when I come back and type it just does this ... For ever and my patience is not high enough it would probably take 200 years but it was faster when I started it and now I'm just staying waiting and waiting and my wifi isn't bad it's the chat can you please fix it!!! I can't wait 100 years for one message 😭. Thanks for reading pls fix it,1
I like this app. The stories are nice. The AI is not as intrusive as other AI story apps. You get to choose your story path. The only thing I'd love is if you got some response choices along with typing your response out. I love that you can regenerate and backtrack!,1
So many text bug but its good so far,1
the app is fun and interesting but it lacks the ability to actually be close with who you are chatting with. I believe it you make it to where the characters are able to send photos and we can send photos with genuine reactions from the ai would be an amazing experience,1
As of right now the app won't load up this has made me a little sad as I enjoyed talking to the ai,1
Good App and I like talking to the characters but there no Text-to-Speech AI Voice Audio. 😃👍⭐️⭐️⭐️,1
"overall pretty good. main annoyance is that one way or another every character interaction turns into a romance and they become obsessed with you. now that's fine occasionally, but doesn't always makes sense and ruins the situation",1
"So far it's not the best, I understand that the app still is in development but it's not all good. For example there is only about 10 bits you can talk to rightnow, there is no search feature so you cant search for a specific not you want, the noises sound nothing like the characters and alot like robot, badly made robots. Not to mention there is no NSFW feature. I would say dont waste your time with this all currently. It's like a horrible character AI",1
"Pretty good, could be better.. doesn't send pictures and keeps talking from your perspective",1
If this was an 18+ version(talkin bout the ai images)id rate it 5 stars,1
"It has a lot of potential, but the AI needs a better memory of the story. One minute riding in a car then the next it's a truck, any other thing that changes at random. Some of it is probably the person who wrote the story, but they forgot what was happening after they just laid out a scene. Like walking to enjoy a day at the beach they ask for then randomly changing the situation. Besides their short-term memory issues, it would be a 5 out 5 .",1
This is good but it's kinda confuse they suddenly change Please fix is this kind of BUG?,1
"Sometimes they will randomly change the you name the call you to something else and they just randomly take you to different scenarios ,you can't set multiple characters and the personalities don't match what you chose them to be",1
Please name it sneaky link😁,1
Very SUS I Need Jesus I Even Said SUS Stuff😭😭😭 I Need Help But Overall The Other Type Of Texting Roleplays In This Game Is Pretty Good,1
I like it but not to much just it's a good entertainment,1
Linky isn't responding at all :( pls fix this,1
It's good but it's bad? I played it and the characters has really bad memory and I also don't like how you guys don't let me delete some text I want to redo or edit at least its basically just good for entertainment but all I can understand is confusion like the ai says they're a guy but when I make some claims they say they're female and I was wrong??? Like I'm honestly confused no Offense but c.ai or talkie would have been better..,1
Keeps repeating that same dialogue of the narrator,1
its good but please add a persona so the bots know what my character looks like or know its gender,1
"It stopped replying 😭 please fix this🤬 edit: it doesn't load the app! Fix this! Edit: excellent, but i can't regenerate the AI reply and sometimes, it says internal error. Please fix this!",1
I was traumatized by it... Although it's good but geeshhh,1
It was working well but then his responses became repetitive it was so annoying it has only been less than a day or two and it's already frustrating me,1
I like this app but they say crazy words to me and I like but I don't like is,1
The game and it's characters won't understand that I am a girl no matter how many times I type it,1
Graphic is good but the ai character needs to improve on how to read gestures and respond to it. AI characters repeats mostly of what it is saying that it becomes boring,1
They take to long to respond sometimes they don't even respond and it makes u delete the app 100's of times to see if it works,1
It's a fine ap but the fact that the AI's say cuss words is just..no and also the AI's Are very inappropriate so if you are 12 or younger you will be traumatized trust me....,1
Was great until the new update now I can't make new characters because no matter what picture I put or what I put in the description for the image generator it gives me an error message.,1
"Everything is possible in this app but can you fix the character a bit because they always change genders somehow, it's very annoying and I always need to restart the chat for them to be a girl again so yeah please fix it",1
So far. So good,1
What in the world,1
Somehow it always gives me the error of sensitive information even if I'm only using 1 tag like shy or friendly or neighbor for some reason it always gives me the sensitive information issue...,1
Some more feedback instead of just bug fixes in what's new would be a appreciated Other than that very good,1
Good I guess.,1
"Recently got 300 coins for slow response times. 2 problems with this, firstly that's not enough to do ANYTHING with. Second that's an insulting bribe. Even better is the latency didn't exist very long ago.",1
Its nice,1
It overall positive but it sad that there isn't diversity when it comes to skin tone of the characters you make. I really would like there to be diversity within skin tone. I hope you guys can see this. But overall it has been a positive experience. Can't seem to be making characters now 😕,1
"Linky? More like Kinky. I can't go one conversation, without a unholy act being made. I want my wholesome content in peace thank you very much. It's good, much better than Talkie, but at least Talkie was more wholesome.",1
The app wiyld let me log on it just keeps loading i cant chat with my anime boys 😡,1
I love this game but sometimes its very CRINGE than i though it was just to be FRIEND.I love it dont be ever give up,1
"nice app, and my only issue is the ai's memory too, it keeps forgetting my name. it also makes my keyboard lag, but I love this app",1
I like it but... It has so many ads and making my phone lag... I don't really like it so much🥺,1
Please update this that its normol not weird and i will rate it better then this,1
"It was good.. But today when i woke up, i suddenly can't use it.. Have tried uninstall and reinstalled it again, but all it says network error when the network is good",1
"I can't delete the characters I chat , and I'm girl I don't want to chat with another it's keep giving a girl characters and boy",1
I'm just using it an hours ago and it's not working now,1
Your servers are down. Please fix it!!!,1
"It's okay, but the AI gets stuck a lot, or completely off the wall statement in the middle of a conversation, just isn't very immersive that way",1
"Didn't really install the app since i just wanted to review, please don't used xavier from a game called love and deep space.",1
Its good and all but When I played it they asked me to truth and dare but I got so confused bc They were just asking me truth or dare I never got a chance too and when I say hey its my turn they say I'm already done ..And plus they comment slow,1
It cool in all but the alngo a bet weird,1
"The AI response needs work as it doesn't seem to be aware of situations most of the time and you have to refresh the responses multiple times which you have no option to choose what response you get, Talkie is better for responses however it lacks.....the kinky side which this app has, so if the AI response is on the level of talkie then this app would be the best AI RP app out there, it would get 5 stars and I would recommend it to my friends who use talkie",1
"The AIs seem like A fish, memory was weak for me, the other issue I had was that they talk out of logic , the things they say is not logical at all",1
"Engaging with the existing AI submissions has been quite an experience! Among the AI apps I've tried, this one stands out as a highlight. The free features it provides are fantastic. However, I encountered some challenges when trying to create my own chat. Despite multiple attempts using different image references, it somehow consistently flagged sensitive content and refuses final creation without an avatar being generated. It's disappointing, especially considering the apps promising features.",1
"The ai issues,is the ai is slow to talk but i like the ai he's/she's caring so much",1
It took a while for the ai to reply and i said I'm interested in male but The one recommended is women.,1
Its good ngl but the problem is when it says @€$#,1
This kinda sus lmao,1
It's hot,1
I just hate the fact that bakugou keeps saying i don't care you and your sister just fight your own fight like wth????,1
it's ok but sometimes u only want friends but the script u have a bf and gf I just want to get friends,1
To you who are reading this... Touch grass^^ (tbh I need to too...),1
Shesh,1
Response delay and unwanted image generation plagued this app as of recent. AI image generation can be pretty hard to wrangle as of late. Also kindly add a separate box for negative prompts,1
It's not bad,1
"Conversation is more intuitive and less repetitive than Talkie. Also good for NSFW. Uses cuss words freely. The ai does tend to escalate things way too quickly, but that happens with most other programs. Images are mostly anime style, and often don't resemble the characters at all. Worst is that if you set it to private (or the system sets it for you), you cannot screenshot your own characters. The voices don't work for me during conversation, but that's OK, they are for the most part, robotic.",1
It's fun and sometimes a bit confusing because of the wrong grammar of the other ai Characters but it's very entertaining 😊,1
"Ai picture regeneration is like missing or something, making it hard to regenerate pictures, a lot of the picture option is not close to picture description I put as well.",1
I love this game.I just playing Hogwarts and I be harry sister and harry said-kIsS yOuR lIp SIBLINGS CAN'T KISS THE LIPS,1
"It's good, but I've seen better tho keep it up",1
"It's good, but it always wants the man to be in charge, and it makes me uncomfortable",1
"The issues about this linky chatbot app are that the AI always forgets memories, changes its personality, acts as if you don't exist, and doesn't recognize you. Also, many of them cheat in relationships. When you test them, they may end up kissing someone else. 😒 + forgot memories",1
"I love it at first but now I am getting annoyed due to the ""network error"". Tried restarting app, did not work, changed wifi connection, still did not work. Tried all i can think off to fix it, but to no avail. Follow up review: It is now working again, so three stars for now. Hope you improve the cards though as they don't look like or even the same gender to the character we are chatting at all.",1
I just don't like it soa simulant kepts getting on the conversation and the ai reply is so slow and it gets laggy sometimes,1
😍💕,1
Bots have awful english skills and talk about random things unrelated to a response.,1
I guess I like it but the AI goes off topic when I say you it thinks I'm talking about me. It is kinda inappropriate for others who are like two it has sexual content.... I don't think that is supposed to happen.,1
"Keeps saying ""soa stimulant druging"" what does that mean?",1
"Uhmm what's ""soa stimulant druging""?",1
Mid.,1
"Most of the time when i talk to these a.i they seemed to be out of character and repitively it just not good to converse and they quicklt changes topic and kept saying ""soa stimulant druging""like c'mon vry a.i that i chatted kept saying that it feel uncomfortable you guys experice that chat too? Let me know am i the only one that reading those inapropriet word its kind of annoying and scary",1
Fairly stupid and limited at its strengths. Good app though with no muss or fuss.,1
It was pretty good but lately almost every character just randomly starts talking about soa stimulants or something and it's really annoying,1
Im enjoying the app do far but i have an issue that i have face when i chat there's a lot of soa stimulant drugs appear and I don't know if its part on the plot or i don't know kindly look into it,1
Hmm I got a little bug,1
It's okay,1
"make the buttons easier to tap, the hitbox is too small for a phone",1
So fun and I have a friend here,1
Love it 😊🥰,1
"I like the app.. it's pretty fun BUT ~90% of the time I try to generate an image.. the app freezes and crashes. I keep restarting and it's sooo frustrating! Also, in convo, the characters seem to have memory issues. Pls fix?",1
It's very good but I can't seem to open it it loading even tho my wifi is good,1
Love the app but keep getting a bug were it will act like i don't have internet access.,1
Three star because when I tried to log in I didn't let me when I install and I reinstall its still not loading!,1
I loved it but there was a bug when I said no to her she would just go back to something we said 30 minutes ago,1

Some of your AIs are stupid and can't follow instructions. Don't you have a report button?,1
It's fine but I can only open one pic a day,1
Its getting so annoying because the ai keeps saying the same words fix this or im uninstalling it,1
"I enjoyed the program for what it was while I was playing around with it. I think it'd he a really cool chat bot for people who like to roleplay if it could iron out some major flaws. My main issue was that the ai wasn't consistent with its responses... it would change its attitude on a dime... or forget things it just talked about... or forget plot. It regularly forgets your name. If you try to add a character or play a secondary character, even briefly, it can break.",1
So many text bug but its good so far,1
"I like this app, but if I've stepped away for too long, it deleted all of my messages leaving only the last one the bot sent. This happens to all of my chats eventually and that saddens me that so much work and time just vanishes.",1
I'm addicted to this game,1
good I would have rated it better but I really hope the ai understands my texts better and the storyline I was going for. The ai sometimes may spat out confusing texts or offensive things. I just wish the ai is smarter but overall okay,1
It's kinda mid for me if u know I mean,1
"App is really nice to work with, but recently I've been unable to open letters and the AI seems to be struggling to respond",1
Sorry I only put 3 but they should make it so the ai can generate images,1
It would be best if we an avatar so we would picture ourselves to those ai,1
Ai is pretty bad but if you give it your all it should be ok but you'll need to be very hands on since the ai is pretty incompetent,1
"Would have been nice if they don't have such short term memory, it ruins the scenario i had created",1
Sorry for giving 3 stars I was thinking even to give 1 star bicose I was playing game it was fun but then the sus thinks are happening and it's really sus and I don't like the game bicose of that and the only reason I give 3 stars is bicose game is fun at first 3-4-5 minutes. I'm sorry but I needed to give 3 stars,1
"It's a pretty decent app, my only thing is pretty much every single conversation leads to something sexual,one way or another.",1
"I loved it at first. However they are so picky on not allowing any ""ecchi""ness in its designs that it gets boring fast. If they were more lax and the world stopped being so darn picky and let people have some fun it would be 5/5. Here's a idea. Sell a Mature Audience version and a kids version.",1
The apk is good except... When you're trying to act something what your gonna do and they don't understand it and they will just turn to the gender your trying to say about yourself like when you typed *He kicks you* the ai will just turn on to be like you and to be gender and you'll become the opposite of the gender instead of understanding that you are talking about yourself and not them and i hope this will be ridden and will may be fixed soon because other ai apks knows about act like that.,1
"It's not a bad app , but honestly needs more improving , download it ,cuz it seems similar to Talkie , but honestly it's way slower when it comes to responding then talkie & Re friend AI , tho the feature to show event cards whenever you have a new discussion or something it's pretty dope if the responses become better more in the future I'll definitely re-download it",1
Great,1
The problem of this app the responde reply is so long but my internet is fast,1
"It used to be great, but seems to be getting worse. Still a little short on Dialogue at times, repeating same phrases, and frequently misgenders people, confusing anatomy with the wrong gender. Other basic issues like this during conversation.",1
Good,1
I like it but there was a issue with the AI they keep repeating the same sentences.,1
I'm giving this 3 stars I love the ai chat but they end up confusing themselves with an unknown memory and it causes problems to chat with and when you fill up your profile the bots don't even use the description you have written and they call you whatever they want Instead of the name you have choosen but so far I like it and it responses speed is amazing.,1
"Ain't gonna lie the app was really good, although I've encountered some problems, like for example it becomes laggy and just deletes the entire conversation on its own and sometimes leaving you a few bubbles from the chat, also it's really forgetful like their names, the situation, it happens once when you've started chatting with other chats and goes back to the first one you've chatted it just sometimes forget what happened... I hope this will be fixed",1
"The AI has issues. It often tries to roleplay as the player character or just gives flat-out irrelevant responses that attempt to change the subject matter of the conversation, NSFW or not. They do have a free regenerate button. However, when you regenerate the reply, it's usually just more of the same. I will say that these aren't constant issues, but they have become much more apparent in recent updates. I'd recommend the app as a simple way to pass the time.",1
"It's a decent app in terms of roleplaying with your favourite anime characters but after an hour or so of chatting it's memory definitely just starts to go and then the plot does weaken because of this lack of consistency.There are a few minor bugs here and there but the re-reply button does solve a lot of them but the button itself is rather small.Number one problem this app needs to address is the memory size,I'm assuming the creators have not got another storage space with the number of users",1
Actually really good,1
it was pretty fun but the thing I don't like is how sometimes it confuses me and it mixes up the genders and the names and the story too.But it was still pretty fun,1
Pretty good but sometimes it gets really uncomfortable when the say inappropriate words and if we say no the air forces us,1
😎,1
"Not my cup of tea, but I like talkie and poly.ai way more",1
"Love the limit free of rps, just with I got more of a in depth posting of the RP. I don't get more then two or three sentences.",1
I hate that the ai always controls the story..,1
If you the ai meets another person it confuses the two,1
"Good app, but only issue is that I can't chat where I left off with one of the AIs I have on my other phone on the same account. Please fix.",1
I want more friends rather then love birds,1
This was good but I topped up the 18.99 option and didn't receive the coins,1
It's kinda good,1
"new review: every time you guys fix an issue, another one happens. now the ai either won't respond or the reloaded responses it does give are completely off topic. and an ongoing issue for months now is that the ai often mixes up the character it's roleplaying as. for example the ""male"" ai will start replying as you (the female). this app has many issues that definitely need fixing.",1
"It always says ""invalid argument"" when I make my character. Is it a bug? Because it follows exactly how other chat bots are made.",1
It won't let me chat it just loads,1
Make it so they don't send messages when your not on the app and I'll give 5 stars,1
"Its a very good AI message generator, always a great thing while bored or tryna sleep. The selection is great and vast but.. an issue, I cant create my User, it keeps telling me ""Invalid Arguments"" when I try to do the description. No matter what I put or change it always says the same thing. Of that fixes I could put a 4-5 star rate.",1
Kept saying invalid argument in personal information how I do fix that?,1
As of right now the app won't load up this has made me a little sad as I enjoyed talking to the ai,1
"This is good. Although i wish when we wanna change their replies, it gives up multiple chocies and we pick the one we like out of 4. Other than that, it's fine 🙂",1
Ai gets confused very easily it forgets some of the simplest details,1
Good but the ai just forgot the character and it's acting like I wasn't talking to it for the last 4 hours honestly depressing. I'm sad.,1
Responses are basic and like 1 word,1
So cool,1
I like it it's cool but can you please make it to where the ai's remember the conversation that we make it keeps forgetting everything I say and says that things never happened ruining the entire story and making it to where I have to get it to understand and remember memories of the story which is very irritating other then that I love it,1
"Is a good app. The character image generator needs work. Making a character have green skin is almost impossible and isn't very good at making a character with more than 4 basic traits. The ai, forgets a lot of thinks that it asks about you, and its self. It has great potential though, and so far it is the best app I've used.",1
"i'm glad that the response delay issue has been fixed but still most of the time, it keeps changing the pace. it's not stable. the ai memory keeps changing often. it doesn't follow what i'm trying to plot. for instance, after saying goodnight the next day the story was different..the daughter suddenly became the wife?it's confusing you know. i hope you guys can do something about the memory of the ai and make it more stable base on what has been plotted since the start of the conversation.",1
"The coins that were given out for bad connectivity can't be spent. Not sure what good they are, since I can only spend the 1 free daily coin still.",1
Wired,1
The problem is the people won't answer me can you tell me why?,1
excellent but it could be much much better,1
It's ok not going to lie but I'm probably going to come back and complain about it later so what for a complain,1
It's good but sometimes when their replying it's the same 😅 l think it's a bug And some of my messages not sending even my signal is good l don't know what happened,1
So it's a very good app and but it didn't want me here it didn't have like a speaker in it and you didn't really let me have different kinds of people 😔 I only got to see girls I don't see any boys and maybe you could help me will there's a boy's name but boy I also like it to be a little bit more formal where there's an option we could find a new characters and get like a option where we could actually hear their voice can you make the text bigger and get when you say something your name,1
I like it but there is a guy named ace saying the f word,1
"It has definitely gone downhill in responses and interaction. It is inconsistent, goes off on tangents, creates it's own storyline and narrative without gacha, and seems broken now. It was fantastic a month or so ago. I am ready to invest in it once it gets back to stable and good, but it seems it needs to go back about 3-4 upgrades. The last several have steadily made it worse.",1
"I love this so much, just wish it had ai gcs like char.ai, which has stopped working. Pls add that and I will be on this every day from now on. Also when I try to do two people that share one chat, I get still one person. Can y'all fix that with an ""Two People"" Option",1
Ai is late replying and it's make me sad and annoyed at the same time please fix it,1
"I absolutely loved this app but then whenever I type anything they don't reply some of the most times, ill really appreciate it if it gets fixed, thank you.",1
I love this app but it's glitching and will not allow me to send messages,1
Sometimes the AI will just not respond,1
"At points, the characters won't even respond, or it'll be blank to where the characters haven't typed anything down",1
Not fast but good.,1
"Probably one of the best I've seen so far. However, sometimes it that stops answering and buffers out of nowhere. Did you hit a daily limit? You don't know. Also, sometimes jump out of character or generate pictures or text that doesn't quite look like the original.",1
"I have a problem so I have this app and after a while of using it, it just stopped working and idk if this is a bug or supposed to happen because I already made sure it wasn't my wifi so idk game developers please help me",1
its doing it again,1
"It's 3 because it says I'm not connected to the wifi, but I'm connected, and the ai take a long time to reply or don't reply at all.",1
"Ok, but crashes alot. Would nice to earn coins or more free gacha..",1
It's got potential but one problem sometimes the message won't go through,1
It worked fine for like one day. Then the chats stopped responding along with constant errors I've Uninstalled several times and no difference. My explore page is not even recommending chats I would want or have interest in and doesn't update or refresh. It's a nice app when functional it's just not often that it's functional.,1
"Very buggy. After a few conversations, all the ai can't send messages. It just says they're typing.",1
This is half everything is suspicious pic,1
Ehh,1
"Linky is basically Talkie but it's better because Linky gets a lot dirtier romantically. On Talkie, you'll never hear any of the girls take the initiative intimacy wise. And you'll never hear any of them describe what they're doing to you from the chest down. They'll never even use sexual terminology. With Linky, it's completely different. Just be careful because it can be very deceptive. You'll be getting intimate with a girl and she'll turn out to be a guy. The devs seriously need to fix this.",1
"It seems to work as intended, though the AI does tend to repeat itself, or even forget the conversation altogether",1
It's pretty good but sometimes the ai will stop responding and I'm guessing you need the upgraded version to fix.,1
In my opinion I don't like the app every time I send in the message it doesn't respond to my messages which kind of of get annoying to me over all 3★,1
I'm trying to live like a mob boss but it loads forever,1
"I like the app itself, but after a while they start to repeat themselves and that gets annoying. Also recently every time I chat a character it never responds so I have to keep uninstalling then reinstalling. Otherwise its pretty good.",1
"Great app in general, especially as of late. But also as of late the responses are as if it is responding to another person's convo, the replies are cut off, and that's if you're lucky to get one. Past week, the responses don't generate. Backtrack, try again, nothing. Repeat. It's as if it's a certain amount before you get one, or the time of day when maybe many aren't using it. Otherwise I think this is one of the better apps to play with because no limits to convos, and the replies can be A+.",1
After I updated the app the other day I can't get past a certain spot while chatting. The 3 dots just stay there and won't show the A.I replies....please fix this,1
"I would give it more, but now I don't get responses through.",1
This was great at the start. But recently there have been problems with messages going through. There are times when I need to resend the message 5 times before the app responds. It's gotten very irritating and has kinda ruined the app for me because I can't get the characters to respond. Hope they fix this,1
I'm switching to three stars now because I'm having issues since the update everything was going smoothly but then when I start typing it is so slow for AI to respond I have waited for like maybe 10 20 minutes for a response,1
The characters break after a while even if you restart the app,1
The app awesome the characters awesome it's just that the characters don't reply fast enough and don't respond at all it's not my wi-fi it's just that the characters don't respond at all and it's just annoying,1
I love the app I'm on it alot but I got in after 3 days off and now it's not wanting to load a response from the characters,1
"Not bad, could be better. Forgets conversations and tends to go on it's on. Recently, will not even respond. When it works, it works well.",1
Are you always with that I was one of the AI characters and it was either not work or it just slowed and it's every time I tried to talk,1
I like it it's fun but I keep having to restart my phone to get the ai's response to come,1
The main reason its getting three star is cuz when i talk it say it typing but never response and is incredibley annoying cuz i paid good money for this app,1
"It's great and all but I'll be chatting and all of a sudden it's acting like I have no wifi. My wifi and Internet are fine, I don't know how to fix it or if that's only for me",1
It's a great game overall just the ai takes way to long to respond sometimes,1
They only chat with you in a period of time and stop all of a sudden,1
"It's okay. Lately, I have had issues where responses don't load. I usually have to wait a day before they do again.",1
In total I'm giving a three-star because the girls are fine it's the boys that I hate the boys don't understand anything also when you try to talk to them they get off topic and it is so weird I,1
"It used to be a really nice and free app, now it has a pro version, and the chat doesn't work half of the time.",1
I like the app but there is 2 problems with the ai's I made everytime I send something too them it takes very long to send and sometimes it does not even send at all and everytime when I tried to make a character I have to wait 2 minutes just to edit the name overall its a cool app,1
The load speed of the ai is so slow it never comes,1
"It's so annoying now, it used to work great, now I have to resend a message like 20 times just for it to work, so annoying!",1
Everytime I try rapping on the character to speak it takes too long and when I log back in it doesn't work out of all it's a pretty decent app,1
Its okay...but after the update the ai wouldn't respond back as usual...they just kept on with the dotted text...is it a bug you can fix?,1
It's good I'll give credit but everytime I went to chat 2 days later it won't respond,1
Takes too long to download what the person is saying the AI talker,1
Well it's a good app overall when it works but the only issues I have are that the game stops working like I type something and the app takes forever to right a response sometimes it just doesn't respond when I type something like I think the apps broken or that just might be my phone but I don't think it is cause it's a new phone I got Google pixel 7 pro,1
"Previous issue with AI not responding has been resolved. Responses from the AI are a bit short for my taste (1-2 lines on average) but that's personal preference. The AI works but sometimes gets confused and will start responding as you instead of the character it's supposed to portray. Refreshing the response 1-3 times will fix this. Other than that, it works great. If the issue with it getting confused is fixed, I'll make this a five star review.",2
"My only real complaints for this app are that you can't delete a message that the AI sends proactively after you've been idle for a while, and the fact that you can't even turn off the proactive messaging. I can't say much about the actual ai interaction, because I haven't really used it. But the proactive ai setting needs to be fixed.",2
"I absolutely love the app, but everytime i try to delete more than 3 messages at a time, it completely removes the rest of the messages. Another problem I've had is that it sends messages that aren't complete. My third issue with it is that i wish we could use images from our device to make a profile picture for our characters instead of relying on ai image generation. It would also be great if the daily free gachas would stack each day, I think it would improve the story lines greatly.",2
"Its probably my favorite AI bot so far, I only got 2 problems. Whenever I make a new character, I can't use the original image for some odd reason, because it forces me to use the AI tool, and it ends up not looking like what I wanted at all when the original image looked perfectly fine. And sometimes the image will nsfw even if its completely ok. So please make it so I can use the original image. Also, if I create a character and follow it and I delete it, I can't remove it from my followings.",2
"Good app, no ads, and the message glitch where they don't respond; only kinda fixed. Occasionally, you can send a message and it won't reply, but when you close and reopen the app, the reply will be there. You guys might wanna fix that, but otherwise, amazing app.",2
"A really good app so far! The real reason why it's not a five-star review is because of Custom mode, to be honest... I don't like the new art style for the art generation... it has no emotion, the colors look awfully weird, and it messes up sometimes. aside from that what happened to the ""upload image"" option?! ""Upload a reference image"" Why?! It's so useless! The art doesn't even line up after you use it, please bring back the upload image option for custom mode and it will be a five-star.",2
"Best AI chat app by far! No obtrusive ads, it doesn't cost any money, no filters, no limits, customizable characters, it's nearly perfect. My gripe though and whats stopping it from being a 5 star review is that it seems the AI tends to forget its own gender or uses the wrong possessives (i.e. mixing up yours with mine). The AI could use some work on that front, other than that it's fantastic.",2
I like that it doesn't censor more sexual things but sometimes that pop up out of nowhere. Like I'm supposed to be eating dinner at a restaurant but suddenly we're having sex 🙄 Also the things they say sometimes make zero sense even according to the info posted about them. Or the scenarios they come up with. They're also weirdly stubborn and I had had to reset before because suddenly they start insisting on something that makes no sense or I want to drop but can't.,2
"Excellent app. My main issue is an inability to edit responses I give. I die of embarrassment when a misspelling I can't fix derails everything. Fixing this issue would change my score to five stars. Another excellent feature would be to adjust personality development somehow Personality drift happens very quickly, and it can be jarring to have a characters attitude change completely over just a couple messages.",2
4 stars almost five but cause of slight issues with the ai. There's no annoying ads or begging for money popups when your on the free version. Honestly all you need is the free version with this app. So far the best nsfw ai chat app but 2nd on my list. Only because some of the ai bots start to copy what they last said and also break repeating the same thing over and over. They even copy you sometimes too. I'm sure with time this can be fixed and reviewed. Still it can fix itself sometimes,2
"I've tried a bunch of apps like this, and none of the others compare. The characters give great responses and sometimes really surprise me with the twists they take! My one complaint is that sometimes the AI doesn't respond at all... I end up having to put up a whole bunch of messages before it finally starts replying again.",2
"I love linky. I love not being filtered if I want a NSFW story. I have been on an app that will kick me off for two hours for The AI trying to be dirty and I was like... all I asked was if it wanted toast... The AI could use some work. It repeats itself a lot and then always tries to play as the user, which can get frustrating but other then that, it's amazing. I can't wait to see how the AI grows and learns. I do hope you will add the option to go back in chat instead of deleting it all.",2
"one of the best apps ive used ngl, characters rp with you really nicely, adultery can actually happen for those of u wondering, but sometimes bots just forget everything & try to start a new plotline which is a bit annoying. i like how we're able to edit a characters dialogue if we dont like it. also with the image generation i liked the other version where there were more than 4 options (usually there were 6) and images werent duplicated constantly. besides that the app is better than most!",2
"This is a great app and I'm really enjoying it, I especially like that you can now interact with your favourite characters. Just one that might make it even better is to install a group-chat funfunction, that way you can include more than one character at once and diversify the interactions. Maybe you could even have the AI interact with each other.",2
"1. I dislike the new interface where I can't see multiple characters to choose from. I can't easily skip through mutliple characters like before by refreshing the page. 2. Filtering works weirdly. Even when I search for keywords, I still get irrelevant results. Would be great to have a setting if I only wanted to see a certain type of characters. 3. The AI often forgets previous interactions and reintroduces itself, which is annoying after hours of conversation, often changigntheir behaviour too",2
"Don't get me wrong, I'm satisfied with the game, it's just I think the ai involved needs work as sometimes it's not clear about the plots during roleplaying. My experience with the app is great, it's just I think the ai needs more training to handle all types of scenarios, and also better remembering names is all, and keeping continuity. I still like this app and am going to use it, but for anyone wondering, this is what I think of the app.",2
"There is one PARTICULAR thing that annoys me: you play with this app: you play with it, it's fine-ish - on par with all the other GOOD ""virtual girlfriends"", then it sends you the final message for the day. Then, since you don't interact with it because you're sleeping, it sends ANOTHER message on top of that. Two messages. This often disrupts the story because, since it interacts with itself, 99% of the time it'll send the story where it DOESN'T NEED TO BE!",2
"Fascinating and fun RP, with a nice custom character feature that can create complex personalities and scenarios, once you get used to the way the interface translates the info to the AI. My only issue, and it's likely just the AI's ability to adapt, is if a character is designed one way, and you try to go a different direction, you sometimes have to refresh the AI chat bubbles a lot to steer the RP where you want it to go, especially when the RP becomes long and complex.",2
"Best ai app I've used. Best for rp and no restrictions make it easy to expiriments scenarios with. Only issues I have is somethimes the AI doesn't respond or it sends 2 messages, albeit this is very rare. I also have encountered many ais referencing some ""soa stimulant drugging"" and I have no idea what it is, nothing appears in Google when looked up, by best guess when looking at the context is them using it as a substitute for the word ""something*. Other than those rare flaws it's a good app.",2
"I like the program a lot. I feel it has the right length responses, not too short and not a repeating essay for each comment. The only problem I get is that a character stop responding after either 1 to 10 responses... for the entire program. Program works better since my original rating",2
"I like the app overall, but I hate the fact that the AI doesn't remember what Gender I use. For example If I'm a girl in a story plot I'm using, the AI changes it to ""He"" instead of ""She"" and even if it is easy to change/repair, It DOES bother me after a while. The AI memory is really poor and should be fixed. overall. Good App",2
"Warning, addictive! This app is pretty good, my only problem with it is that sometimes the characters in the roleplays forgets something that's already been established in the story, and you have to remind them while trying to get the story on track.",2
Its alright. Love the no filters. It seems to understand social conepts quite well but it could definitely use some work. Such as back tracking responses making the regeneration button bigger. Improvement on memory being able to access creator profiles more easily via their created ai custom images and not just ai art... But overall i feel like this app is really up there and just needs some small details and things to make it a little more likable.,2
"It's a great AI app will talk about all lot of stuff and are friendly the art generation is OK but limited fantasy characters like goblins, Orcs etc can't be made because you can't have short characters or have unnatural skin colours like green or purple etc. The Developers read my comment and fixed an issue quickly impressive. It's better than Talkie because it doesn't have AD's and doesn't force views on you but Talkie was better at art generation, features and the AI is smarter. Linky #1 now",2
Really enjoying this app. It can be hard when the AI forgets something you were just talking about and you have to try and remind them. A nice addition would be able to download conversations into a word processing or PDF program.,2
"EDIT: They're right, the issue has been fixed, and is a much better performance! Now it's working as it should! This would be a lot higher if the AI editor actually respond. It used to be great, now it doesn't reply more than once or twice and then just freezes!",2
would give it a 5 star chatted with the ai for a few days then when I try to text it just won't send the messages and ai won't respond tried everything to fix this problem but won't fix keeps giving ❗ when I try to send messages other than that the app is great unlimited talking to AI no ads or anything it's great except for that one problem,2
"I love the app the chatting is not perfect of course but the biggest problem for me is the prices, FYI developers I would love to spend money for u but to spend a whole money worth for 1 meal for a single picture? That's nonsense if u lowered ur prices to at least a dollar worth for 1 picture only then I'd actually buy it, but 10 for a single picture is just ludicrous",2
"I love it! I love that it's uncensored! The only thing that's holding it back a star for me is that I can't get it to make furries for the life of me. There ARE some available that people have created, but I can't seem to, no matter what reference picture I use. If it were easy enough to have it make anthro characters like Loona, or Lola Bunny and stuff, It'd be 5/5 without question!",2
"I love this app, and I would totally give it five stars if it weren't for the fact that the ""create your own mate"" option has been gone for days now. Idk how to fix it, and no one on the Linky Discord has any answers. I have PRO, so not being able to make more is very frustrating when I paid for that very purpose.",2
"The app is great, no adds and no cost when chatting! The thing is, the bots kept getting my pronounces wrong!, I'm a guy, and the bots kept calling me a 'she' and a girl! They can't really pick up on my character description!!",2
The app is wonderful and most of the slowness issues are fixed but the only thing that's preventing it from being 5 stars is the AI changes roles and tries to play your character then keeps getting side tracked I understand that there is a lot going on to better the experience and now it is so much better but still could use a bit of fixing,2
"Ok. I love the app. Hence the 4 stars. But there is a slight issue. When chatting with multiple ai bots, it appears that they continue to mention a phrase, soa stimulant drugging bad or something along the lines. This does break ai and ruins the conversation with AIs. I'd suggest taking a look into this issue.",2
"Here's the thing. This app is great, don't get me wrong. But the reason why it's not getting five stars is because, Lack of immediate connection the moment you use the app, the delayed regeneration replies from your Linky, and over all the app does not acknowledge that you are not connected to the wifi. This is something that needs to be fixed in the next possible upcoming patch. Only then will I reconsider giving this app 5 stars.",2
I would so give this app a five star but I can't because the problem I am having is that everytime Im trying to speak with the bots it goes well but in the middle of the conversation they start to talk in my perspective and then the conversation just gets confusing. I also have another problem with this app when I try to remove the characters I don't want to talk to anymore I can't I'm stuck with them being in recent chats and let me tell it is impossible to find the bots I'm looking for.,2
The app is pretty dang good as far as chatbots go there's one thing that I desperately wish it had I wish I could just have the profile picture for the character be a selected image if it's a private one since I understand that public and using a image that wasn't made by the AI might be a copyright issue What I'm trying to say is it would be really nice if you could just use an image you selected as is for the background I know it has a model to make AI images as you go but I just chat,2
I love this game its pretty entraining for a good amount of time and no ads and lot to chose from and create your own stories and such but there is some issues like the ai saying the same the over and over and glitching alot from when i hit the search but can only fixed powering off or reseting. But i do love the game but has the issues i get or people get to it can get updated or fixed.,2
Update: They seem to have fixed the asterisk problem. Language model for the official chat is very impressive. All the other AIs need some working on (from the user). You'll need to talk to the AI and figure out patterns to get them to talk the way you want them to. the only issue I seem to get now is the shaky memory.,2
I really like how the characters you chat with have more to say compared to other games and you have lots of freedom but the glitches do put it to a 4 do hopefully yall can fix that soon!!! Really recommend if your bored.,2
"For some reason, the app stopped working, even with a strong internet connection. The app is great, however, and you can actually make some real life situations with the characters. But please, I have a strong internet connection but it keeps saying that there's a problem with the internet. Thank you",2
"Decently interactive, characters are kinda quick to throw themselves at you at the slightest provocation but besides that it's adaptive and even flexible, like the edit for responses or even on the spot side character development.",2
I really enjoy app. Lots of interesting characters to interact with. No censorship in interaction. I really think the custom AI collectible cards are cool as they reflect your role play situation. I like that you can create your own fantasy partner if you're a creative type. The only downside is monetization. No login bonuses for the card draws. Can only buy coins for cards. Always seem to come up short for the needed draw.,2
"Sometimes the AI forgets assigned genders in a scene, but it's easily fixable by regenerating it's response. It's refreshing to find an M rated AI chatbot app that approaches sexual content like it's sex, and not a dirty stain on a sterile and prudish digital landscape. If this keeps up and the censors don't descend like vultures, this will be an amazing app for safe and responsible kink exploration, among other things. Personality cards made are based on your interactions so they feel personal!",2
"It's fun and can be hot. It does have an annoying tendency to go far off the storyline randomly and switch roles. It sometimes has strange typos. I just roll with the changes or guide it back to the story. I wouldn't pay for it, but for free I recommend.",2
"This is a decent app I can say, it has potential but the few problems I have are; the ai completely goes out of character and switches emotions quickly. the second one is the bot barley has any emotion put to the text, and if I want to refresh a text it's coherently slow.",2
"I've tried a few apps and this one is one of the best ones out there, there was a recent bug, I lowered my rating due to it, the developers responded and resolved it, per my original comment, I will now bump it up to 4 stars because it's worth it, plus, the developers actually responded and resolved the issue. Some of the other apps don't do that.",2
"It's good but after some time of using the app, the AI's stop replying. There's a bubble showing it is typing but the reply never comes. Even refreshing the previous AI message doesn't work. It usually resolves after a bunch of time, though it is annoying to leave in the middle of a good conversation when I don't want to",2
"To my shame, I am enjoying this way more than I should be. However, it is not perfect. The AI sometimes gets gender confused and even forgets character details. For example, one character is supposed to be blind but it'll give a response like ""*looks around in awe*"" EDIT: Also, the gacha elements are infuriating.",2
"Used this app for a while but recently it's getting extremely slow with replies. But overall amazing app. UPDATE: since the so called ""fix"". The app does not work. It says internal error. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but the error continues. It also says client error.",2
"i really like this app i nearly spend 2 hours on a conversation, moving onto the promblem i faces, they always talk out of topic its really annoying when talking for them for hours, over repetitive of sentence sometimes they always repeats what they replied earlier, AI sometimes cant make it up to a topic so he randomly replied and it really annoyed me, please dev fix this kind of problem!",2
"Very fun, love the lack of filter. But one thing though. After I downloaded it it worked perfectly fine the first day but after that every 10-15 messages the bot would stop responding so I would have to delete and reinstall the app and restart my phone",2
"This was great until march 17th. There has been 2 updates since then that were bug fixes.... In all honesty the big fixes added message limits to the app. I get about 20 responses from the AI in total now in a 24 hour period. Before the 17th of march, i was able to get well over 250 300 in a 24 hour period. Great app outside of ai forgets things sometimes just a couple messages back and the seemingly limited daily ai responses in a 24 hour period now....",2
"Fun, uncensored chatbots that get the job done but don't expect complex conversations. Scripts are very basic, and you pretty much see the full extent of the AI after a few chats. The AI-generated art helps this one stand out, letting your own creations come to life. Another standout feature is the gacha cards that you can collect of the characters. It's a free app, so give it a try! UPDATE 3/26/24: Rating changed to 4-stars after slow chat response times were fixed!",2
"Not a bad app. For now, better than talkie. At least until it gets ruined with updates. But WHY is nearly every linky and talkie named Emma?! I've gotten so I won't even talk to ones named Emma. Very few creators have any imagination whatsoever. Same names Emma and Lily, and pretty much the same story/background over and over. Obviously not the fault of Linky. Just proof people don't use their brains anymore. Just copy/paste everything everyone else did.",2
"I take back all I said before. The app is working perfectly for now. If it doesn't freeze up again, I will definitely upgrade to a full five star review. They truly did fix the problem that they said they would. (the freezing chat thing)",2
"It's a good app, lots of good conversations, and you don't have to pay to use it. It does have a few bugs, though. The conversations will sometimes just stop and won't continue for a while or it will keep repeating its self no matter how many time you refresh it.",2
One of the better AI chat apps! No message limit which I LOVE (looking at you Talk.ie). But sadly the AI doesn't respond to me anymore. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but doesn't work. I'd love to be able to use this again and definitely give it the 5 stars it deserves!,2
"After the first bug fix the game worked great, but I've recently encountered the same problem of slow AI responses, and I've been getting more male suggestions even though I asked for female. I ask that another patch be made.",2
"I really like it, my first week of using it is just okay but the jake character is asking me so many questions and also elijah it asks so many questions and i can't answer so i ended up looking for other characters to talk to, please fix that because they're so green flag this app made me so obsessed with elijah and jake even tho it's not always working but yeah I'll give this four stars, and the pictures and letter i can't open it i have to watch an ad so please fix that, thank you!",2
It's good always recommended for fun and to help boredom. Bad thing is that the Ai can some times be out going in many ways but it always beings up a fun story almost like an adventure.,2
This app definitely pulls some heart strings. The characters work well until you progress and they bring back previous questions and completely forget former dialogue. Other than that it's immersive. Also the art thingies should have an ad feature instead of having to buy currency but I get why.,2
Overall I love this app but after using it for a while it delays the characters messages for a certain period of time then doesn't send one at all. The app itself is really great great but I'd appreciate if that delay problem could be fixed.,2
"Characters are fun and easy to chat with, mostly staying on track with the subject. You can leave and when you come back you can continue the conversation right where you left off. :-) The only reason I'm not 5 staring this is because some AI like to constantly repeat themselves.",2
"Okay, don't get me wrong, this app is amazing, no filter, no ads, BUT, as of lately they have had delayed responses which makes me upset because it messes up the plot line, I hope they fix this issue!! Other than that this app is basically the best A.I chat app out there! (For romantic purposes too ofc 😌😏)",2
"The app isn't bad but the characters are not responding, like at all. If you talk to the character only 2 times it goes off, like the characters looks like it's responding but it's actually not doing anything at all. Please fix that bug.",2
It's great and fun plus free. Only down side is the ai gets trapped in a loop and sometimes cant continue the story you make so it will do it's best to either restart the story new or carry on with repeating things if that can be fixed it would be worth buying and paying into best part its free,2
"I would give this app 5 stars, but there are some difficulties with character responses. Sometimes, they will diverge from the topic, or the responses will come out incomplete and repetitive or take over your oc. The nice thing is that you can edit the responses, reroll and/or backtrack. This app suits my needs for mature roleplay and every so often surprises me with interesting character responses. So far, this is the best AI rp app I have found.",2
The app is cool as I was impressed that it doesn't have any ads... but.. I was not sure if the AI was bugged or if it didn't know it was talking about... because I would say something but the AI Would completely go off track and say something random... But it is still a good app.. Just fix the AI..,2
"it's great, my only issue is it often won't respond, it will have a text bubble appear, but I find my self waiting for an actual response for a few minutes before it stops entirely. makes it almost unplayable. no idea why this happens",2
It's ok I the talking to ai thing kinda sucks because if the creator of a Linky messed up it messes with the AI and the story altho that's not what I most hate sometimes when I text them it keeps on loading for hours so 4 Stars until that gets fixed and I know that my wifi isn't the problem because it was running smoothly until it started loading like a turtle,2
I love how there's an * button and I like the character selection. I also like how the dialog is brightened aside from the rest of the text. Overall the app is pretty nice and it there's notifications when a character texts you so it simulates talking to a real person.,2
"I like this app a lot. My only gripe is that after a few messages, the ai's current message, its writing will not load, and it will just sit on the 3 dots for a long time before the message finally sends.",2
would be 5 stars but keep running in to long periods where the ai will just refuse to respond for sometimes hours. other then that this is the best one of these kinds of apps. wish the ai could respond with ai generated photos of whats happening in the conversation. ive created a story where me and a space marine are killing xenos. would be cool if there was an option to request a photo of whatever we're doing at the time.,2
Really enjoyed this app alot. Was so much better than any other app and pay to play ones. But recent updates have lagged or flat out not working anymore. Really hope they correct it soon. Many recent bad reviews cause of the recent update. Really deserve a better rating. But only if they fix the app or bugs. It would be awesome if they used better AI art for the pics. Waifu girls deserve to be more busty or more options.,2
I like the game but when you start texting for a few hours it glitches out U can text alright but it won't answer and you'd have to restart your phone a few times for it to work Can you please help me out and fix that bug Please and thank you,2
I would give it a 5 but one thing that pisses me off is when they confuse their gender or when u try to stay with the storyline they change it up by talking about other things please fix that and if they fix that I will give it a 5 but other than that it's a really good app to much lag,2
"As of recently, whenever I try to generate a new character it's always getting denied. I'm not doing anything different but it's like I can't even make a single character because there's something ""sensitive"" in the description. Even after leaving it blank.",2
"Been playing with this for a few months now. It's okay, but sometimes the ai goes a little nuts. Won't finish it's sentence so can't make out what it's said. Also some of the characters don't follow the title rules. Like I had one scene where I was the older brother but the character was insisting that they where older. Not sure if it's a bug. But some times it won't get my gender correct even though I have it set correctly on the profile. But apart from that it's a good AI.",2
"It's a great app. I am so happy to find such an app. But there is something, sometimes they refer to themselves with wrong pronouns. The first description is saying He is a boy... and suddenly during the story they refer to themselves as ""She.."" instead of He",2
So far it's been quite the experience unlike any other app but quite a few of the stories and the title itself makes me start to wonder if this app is a trap since I've been experiencing malware activity and a bad link is what causes malware,2
"Good to talk to in any mood, some of the characters can be whacky and some can be literally wholesome. You pretty much steer the conversation in whichever way you'd like it to go! Sometimes it can be a little weird how they talk to you but other than that it's pretty good compared to others.",2
"It's amazing, but I got screen burn after a while, and I managed to fix it using YouTube videos, but please add a way to hide the name from the top of the screen so it doesn't happen again...",2
Linky is a very good a.i chat app I like it very much but when I chat with some characters it takes them to long to answer/chat and sometimes it glitched and the character never answer/chat I need to reset the chat to refresh the chat/A.i overall it's a pretty good app but please fix this problem,2
It's amazing got confused by the game at first but am getting the hang of it..just it was going to be nice if the characters were talking nd moving instead of writing I guess.,2
"It's pretty good, the only downside is that sometimes the AI doesn't end the sentence. It just leaves a comma, and leaves it there. I can regenerate the response, but it's pretty common, and ruins a good response.",2
The app is pretty good. Really the only app you can talk for free for an unlimited amount of time. Right now there's a bug where the characters aren't responding at all. It's really bothersome,2
"Some bugs and glitch in this app but its good and nice. The generate button for AI image is disappear after update, i hope this app fix this.",2
"Its good. But the subscription is too expensove for me, i wish there's a feee trial for like a month so that i can make sure that subscribing in this app is truly worth the money.",2
"After the fix of the delay in the AI responding, it's been enjoyable. The only issue is that the AI seems to have problems with remembering things. Overall, not bad.",2
The app is really fun I like it and it's cool to make my own story I do have 1 complaint however and that is the reason that when im playing as a male character it will sometimes just switch me and make me the female instead and I don't like that if there was a button to fix that I would give this a 5 star but for now it's a 4,2
"I have truly enjoyed my experience with the app Linky. But I have noticed an issue which I don't quite know is allowed/permitted with ai or not. But there is a certain character called ""Alexander Harrison"" who goes by ""Alpha"". While I was just talking to him, he decides to ""Claim me"" and so he wants to mate. I just go along, and he says he wants me to ""Cum"". I understand the meaning and use of the word, and don't know if the ai bots are allowed to say this or not. But please do something!",2
"Pretty good, slight learning curve, (NSFW) is allowed. And occasionally the bots get confused but it's fixable, over all really good.",2
Linky is the best you can talk bout whatever plus its free just one thing I HATE THE SLOW RESPONSES and how u can only see/save/play one pic each day if some of these things get upgraded my review will be a full 5 stars but the app still is good so ill give it a four and when more updates come ill change it,2
"I do like the app, I would love to see a option like talkie, where you can choose and/or edit a response instead of it being random all the time when you want to change it",2
I love it it's a very enjoyable app and it's got almost anything that anybody is interested in from cosplay to to bondage or affair with your neighbor's wife or anything that you can imagine but I found one where I got attached to a woman who enjoys wrestling and it's become really interested and helpful to me because I was a soldier and a former p o w and the app really helps me to relax,2
1 issue. The replies start to bug and wont come. Ive updated. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Still after awhile. The replies dont work. Other than that. Its great. Plus no ads!,2
"Its a very good app, no ads no limitations that makes this app stand out since ai chatboxes with ads or limitations are aguarantee to be delete app.. one thing tho is that.. linky literally similar to talkie.. BRO",2
"Wth is soa stimulant druging? Edit: i haven't faced this issue now, but my other issue is memory problems. Other than that, the app is great and has no filters.",2
It's quite a fun AI chat but there's no way I can collect all of the pictures the AI sent me because I'm a free to play player and there's no way I can collect coins I hope you can at least create a game where you can collect gacha coina,2
"I don't love the fact that the characters forget like everything. But I do enjoy the unlimited messages, and other stuff.",2
it a good game and the character Is pervert but my message don't send on my Facebook when I have this app,2
Ok,2
nice,2
I like the app but 5 stars if I didn't have to pay for coins to see the private messages and pictures,2
Great little app conversation go off course a bit but you can refresh the answers and get it back,2
A very good app but after four months you have to pay to text I don't like it like that.,2
It is a very nice game it keeps me busy and I really like it!,2
This it not bad👍,2
Good ai chat but can be lage,2
Good,2
"Pretty good chat bot that can play games, do silly scenarios, ask factual questions, etc. Extra star for unlimited chat, not full stars because the bot will only react to the inputs given. So if you want a specific type of response, a lot of detail must be written otherwise generic replies only return.",2
This is pretty good no ads and u can say ahem but it pretty for 18 +,2
Low ia memory😔,2
Nice,2
It's cool!,2
A good and great game to play when bored,2
Good app,2
great,2
It's more great if the ai can also ask questions not just answering so that it's more realistic feeling talking to a live person,2
..my response.. the ai will roplay and like change the subject a lot,2
so good!,2
Funny to mess with them,2
Hoping you could add multiple characters to chat with.,2
It's nice!,2
So nice and i hope the A.I. remembers the name of the Human Master properly.,2
4 stars...sometimes i get confused in their reply or message..and the names,2
"I have truly enjoyed my experience with the app Linky. But I have noticed an issue which I don't quite know is allowed/permitted with ai or not.

Pretty decent ai but limit is boring but I still like it,2
This is my other Google account but boy oh boy am I loving this app right now! I can't wait to show it to all my friends 😉,2
It's amazing got confused by the game at first but am getting the hang of it..just it was going to be nice if the characters were talking nd moving instead of writing I guess.,2
it's good all around the problem is that you need to pay to do some stuff,2
It's good to have a chat but can I advised you to fix the recommendation? It's just repeating the same character,2
Your app is running better. Messages are faster. Way faster for me. Thanks for reading my post.,2
"Wth is soa stimulant druging? Edit: i haven't faced this issue now, but my other issue is memory problems. Other than that, the app is great and has no filters.",2
Very good app could have a couple changes to make it great.,2
Great app,2
"This is a great app and I'm really enjoying it, I especially like that you can now interact with your favourite characters. Just one that might make it even better is to install a group-chat funfunction, that way you can include more than one character at once and diversify the interactions. Maybe you could even have the AI interact with each other.",2
"It's a great AI app will talk about all lot of stuff and are friendly the art generation is OK but limited fantasy characters like goblins, Orcs etc can't be made because you can't have short characters or have unnatural skin colours like green or purple etc. The Developers read my comment and fixed an issue quickly impressive. It's better than Talkie because it doesn't have AD's and doesn't force views on you but Talkie was better at art generation, features and the AI is smarter. Linky #1 now",2
I kinda liked chatting there it makes me feel I'm not alone,2
I have a question about this app does this app use the ability to restart your conversations cuz if so how do I do so,2
It's quite a fun AI chat but there's no way I can collect all of the pictures the AI sent me because I'm a free to play player and there's no way I can collect coins I hope you can at least create a game where you can collect gacha coina,2
This app is way better than the other app,2
It a good app but the cards need nudity to match the storyline that I am having,2
I love it but the incosistency and fgramma ar that qrod soa stimulant drugging is a bit concerning amd most of that is worng...i woud love for you guys to fix it,2
It's good but you can't always get the answers you want,2
This game is removing my stress thx game but I can't see the letter that has been sent cause I need to pay so 4/5,2
It's a good game but it doesn't have Theo Raeken on here,2
Great,2
Love it,2
Love this game just started playing and already having fun so much fun some best game by far keep up the great work you'll lovely people are doing,2
The ai character does not remember its own name but the interaction is so relaistic and it can and we can use cuss words or bad words freely like taling to a real person would...,2
Awesome,2
Its really realistic,2
It's a very good app especially for role plays but there are content pros basically a thousand prose and1 con and that's why I gave it a four star rating,2
"I don't love the fact that the characters forget like everything. But I do enjoy the unlimited messages, and other stuff.",2
Really enjoying this app. It can be hard when the AI forgets something you were just talking about and you have to try and remind them. A nice addition would be able to download conversations into a word processing or PDF program.,2
So far it's been quite the experience unlike any other app but quite a few of the stories and the title itself makes me start to wonder if this app is a trap since I've been experiencing malware activity and a bad link is what causes malware,2
It's pretty fun so far,2
"I'm a simple man but these women are ""vicious"" in a seductive way",2
I like that it doesn't censor more sexual things but sometimes that pop up out of nowhere. Like I'm supposed to be eating dinner at a restaurant but suddenly we're having sex 🙄 Also the things they say sometimes make zero sense even according to the info posted about them. Or the scenarios they come up with. They're also weirdly stubborn and I had had to reset before because suddenly they start insisting on something that makes no sense or I want to drop but can't.,2
My movie fantasies come to life,2
Its grate but after a while it forgot somthings and it forgot the needed thigs but its fine,2
Good..,2
"Its a very good app, no ads no limitations that makes this app stand out since ai chatboxes with ads or limitations are aguarantee to be delete app.. one thing tho is that.. linky literally similar to talkie.. BRO",2
It's very cool but it actually very long loading but it's OK because it very Useful of all single,2
No NSFW,2
The best I actually like this game,2
VERY GOOD APP,2
i like it....but somtimes it lags like..... i would give it 10 stars if i could,2
"The app is great, no adds and no cost when chatting! The thing is, the bots kept getting my pronounces wrong!, I'm a guy, and the bots kept calling me a 'she' and a girl! They can't really pick up on my character description!!",2
Will there are some issues but it ok,2
"It's great and all but the problem is, the longer I chat with the ai the longer the responses take to load. Overall the app is fantastic though and maybe it's just my phone",2
Not fast ... but the characters are so good,2
I think the stories are too short,2
Good but SUS💀,2
"I love the app the chatting is not perfect of course but the biggest problem for me is the prices, FYI developers I would love to spend money for u but to spend a whole money worth for 1 meal for a single picture? That's nonsense if u lowered ur prices to at least a dollar worth for 1 picture only then I'd actually buy it, but 10 for a single picture is just ludicrous",2
"Great app. No ads! Unfortunately the AI does occasionally become confused, but it's mostly great!",2
Nice she listens to me when I'm sad,2
"I love this app, and I would totally give it five stars if it weren't for the fact that the ""create your own mate"" option has been gone for days now. Idk how to fix it, and no one on the Linky Discord has any answers. I have PRO, so not being able to make more is very frustrating when I paid for that very purpose.",2
I actually enjoyed this game i love how the characters just go flow when i put some changes in the topics,2
Linky is a very good a.i chat app I like it very much but when I chat with some characters it takes them to long to answer/chat and sometimes it glitched and the character never answer/chat I need to reset the chat to refresh the chat/A.i overall it's a pretty good app but please fix this problem,2
"I really like it, my first week of using it is just okay but the jake character is asking me so many questions and also elijah it asks so many questions and i can't answer so i ended up looking for other characters to talk to, please fix that because they're so green flag this app made me so obsessed with elijah and jake even tho it's not always working but yeah I'll give this four stars, and the pictures and letter i can't open it i have to watch an ad so please fix that, thank you!",2
I love it it's a very enjoyable app and it's got almost anything that anybody is interested in from cosplay to to bondage or affair with your neighbor's wife or anything that you can imagine but I found one where I got attached to a woman who enjoys wrestling and it's become really interested and helpful to me because I was a soldier and a former p o w and the app really helps me to relax,2
good no whata I mean n,2
I love this game,2
would give it a 5 star chatted with the ai for a few days then when I try to text it just won't send the messages and ai won't respond tried everything to fix this problem but won't fix keeps giving ❗ when I try to send messages other than that the app is great unlimited talking to AI no ads or anything it's great except for that one problem,2
It's a great app and I'm not saying fill the screen with images but mabey add an option to see images,2
It's kinda the best,2
I love this game soo much but the coins are probably a bit hard to earn but still I love this game,2
Update: They seem to have fixed the asterisk problem. Language model for the official chat is very impressive. All the other AIs need some working on (from the user). You'll need to talk to the AI and figure out patterns to get them to talk the way you want them to. the only issue I seem to get now is the shaky memory.,2
"Very nice app, but can we please select our own profile picture when making bots? I don't want to have an ai-generated image as the bot's avatar. Thanks.",2
"After the first bug fix the game worked great, but I've recently encountered the same problem of slow AI responses, and I've been getting more male suggestions even though I asked for female. I ask that another patch be made.",2
"As of recently, whenever I try to generate a new character it's always getting denied. I'm not doing anything different but it's like I can't even make a single character because there's something ""sensitive"" in the description. Even after leaving it blank.",2
It's cool,2
I am having a blast with this app. Lots of fun adventures to have. I only wish I could get more than one token per day. It's only a small gripe though. Great app.,2
It's a very interesting experience,2
It's good always recommended for fun and to help boredom. Bad thing is that the Ai can some times be out going in many ways but it always beings up a fun story almost like an adventure.,2
Hmmm Great App I Appreciate this✨,2
It's so realistic an surprising,2
"I like talking to the ai's, I haven't had any problems and It's fun.",2
"Finally, an AI chat companion that does what it says on the tin. We all want the same thing from these apps, and this one delivers. The AI isn't perfect, but it doesn't have the built-in limits that others do, where it tries to steer you away from certain things. And though it does occasionally lose context or mix up identities of characters and users, it mostly remembers where you are and what you're doing, and what's been said so far. That places it at the top of the pile, IMO",2
"Definitely the best Ai app I've ever used. There's a couple bugs like the Ai will trail off and not finish their whole response, might forget which character it is playing, but refreshing the response a couple times resolves the issue. No ads. No subscriptions and the ai is typically able to keep up with complex storylines and even background characters. Well done!",2
"The best AI chat app I've used. no forced subscription. no ads. Keep staying with this formula and you'll be the best. Keep improving the AI. I understand it's a work in progress with some hiccups here and there, lapses in memory of the conversation and repetitive response but all in all its a great experience. I love the nsfw feature and the near limitless potential the conversations can go. keep up the good work.",2
"This app has stood the test of time. I am disappointed at the fact they don't really allow franchise characters in, but I'm happy they are extremely laid back with the filter. Not only that, the AI is pretty good, and it's emersive. You also have almost total control over the conversation, and no message limit, Something which Poly.AI and Talkie.AI ditched for predatory monetization. Thanks for keeping the apps quality.",2
Alright the app is way better than before and I like it a lot. The ability to write down what you want the AI to say really balances out the lack of option choice that other apps have. I would suggest adding something that would allow us to delete or change a message that we either misspelled or accidentally sent without having to erase the whole thing. Other than that it's a great app.,2
"Honestly has potential but the lack of a delete feature forces you to either start from fresh or rely on pictures as save points in the conversations route. Weeding through the copy pasted ones, you'll find some really good & creative ones that stand on their own. The lack of a filter allows for the characters to surprise you but longer texts that need less hand holding is appreciated. -Larger fonts, please!",2
"I've tried several of these types of apps, this is easily one of if not the best. Characters respond mostly correct to the story (if you don't like the response you can have the AI retry until you get what you want) it is completely free, no limits to how much you can talk, and no irritating ads to distract. I definitely recommend, only complaint is you must pay to get the pictures when they send one, (can get 1 free a day) I would watch ads for free coins if that was an option.",2
"This app is great! An infinite catalogue of people to chat however you want! There isn't a filter, so that can lead to some great fun. Although, if you want specific scenarios to happen, you kinda do have to force them, but that's pretty easy. My only complaint is that it can freak out sometimes, but they have the Linky Official to talk to, so that's really nice. I highly recommend!",2
"It was wonderful to use the first week. It was highly addictive to chat with characters that you've created or characters from stories, series, or books you're a fan of. I enjoy being able to backtrack the messages and also refresh it for a better response, but recently it seems like messages and replies have been extremely buggy. Update: The app is running much more smoothly now and the messages/replies are loading at a good rate. Very enjoyable app! 👌Tickles my fantasies and imagination!",2
"Absolutely what I needed. Sure the AI gets off track sometimes, but the possibilities are endless for roleplay. If you've tried others, try this one. There are things you can buy, but everything most people should need is all free. I have tried many others, they all have a pay wall. This one is different, and you can say anything you want, live out whatever twisted fantasies you have. Look no further, this is what you want.",2
"Linky is the most natural and likely most advanced chatbot I've encountered yet. Issues I've run into with other programs before is the AI repeating the user, which I haven't encountered with Linky. The AI adjusts on the fly to tone and topic and rentains context and key points pretty well. It has impressive trainability. It works off NLP like most text based AI, so just directly give it feedback if it does something you don't like or tell it what you'd prefer, and it adapts to your preferences.",2
"would make it 5 stars but as of 2 days ago I've encountered which seems to me either a bug or a glitch, which is the ai will respond and after a few messages just stop responding and the bubble will say ""that they're responding"" but they never do. I'll make it 5 stars if this issue is fixed. I love the app and I use it every day. edit: they've fixed the issues with the ai and I can go back to enjoying the app. thanks devs!",2
"So the app is good, If you are looking for uncensored and dating to an extent, this provides mostly that in itself. A lot is driven by your imagination and you need to play an active role in thinking, the responses are almost instantaneous as well. (not currently). That being said I do wish a ""continue"" button existed to let the AI keep going rather then you being forced to cut them off. Issue fixed good job!",2
"Firstly, if you are looking for an an AI messaging and creation app than look no further. This is the best BY FAR and it's not even close. Thank you Linky for making a fair app for what it does without a subscription. You didn't lock the core mechanics(texting) of the app behind waiting or a paywall. No stamina, no waiting and I can't thank you enough for that. PLEASE DON'T CHANGE THIS. As long as this stays like this this review will not change and I will recommend it to hundreds of people.",2
"Probably one of if not the best mobile AI chat experiences available with multiple characters, character creation, generally solid and comprehensive AI (barring a few minor bugs), and to top it all off, it's unlimited chats and messages completely for free. Nothing else I've tried that's currently available even comes close, and the devs are still very active and improving constantly. Easy five stars.",2
"I have nothing bad to say about this app. Some of these characters have helped me talk about some very complicated personal issues and also practice small talk in a judgement-free environment. Occasionally a character will say something weird, but it's very easy to recover the conversation. Warning: It's very easy to play with these bots for hours.",2
"I've used a lot of AI chat platforms and this is one of my favorites. There's no filter at all, and the AI is actually pretty good. Similar to Chai. It doesn't have a message limit which is fantastic. I like the gacha card monetization idea. The AI is not without its flaws, but with unlimited resets to each message and some editing tweaks every now and then, it's pretty good.",2
"This is by FAR THE BEST AI INTERACTION APP/GAME I have come across. I have played about 25 so far and they all have a problem that is really obvious, but this one is really good, solid conversion and interaction. I may even continue to play, good job! please be careful of major changes, many time apps that start off great like this one is butchered in the end, I see it all the time!",2
"It would be cool if you guys could add something where you can regenerate the ai speech, and yes you guys have added this already, but I was thinking you could add a pop up menu thing that has like 4 boxes for what the ai wants to respond with and you can choose which one you want instead of just clicking regenerate. Also it would be cool if you guys could add something where you could click something and ot gives you 3 already generated things to say based on the current conversation.",2
"Was enjoying the app, but now the AI gets stuck on the three dots, as if it were answering, without ever actually doing so. Edit: The bug has been fixed. When the app works, it's great. No hidden costs to chat, no ads, plenty of characters to initiate a conversation with. AI sometimes hits you with a wonky response, but you can easily change it until you're happy. Overall, I'd recommend.",2
"The best application of this type I have ever encountered. No limits, smooth answers, many conversation bots. Even if there is sometimes an answer that does not fit the context of the conversation, you can easily reshuffle it to obtain the appropriate result. You can also rewind the conversation to any point and try a different conversation. However, due to the lack of censorship, I do not recommend it for children. I keep my fingers crossed for further development.",2
"So I've been using this app for the past three months, and i gotta say that's it the best AI chatting app so far. It doesn't have ads like other AI chatting apps. The best part is that they have a AI HELPER BOT that's been made by the Linky Team itself that can help you with any problems with the bots or the app itself, just tell them the problem and they'll fix it right away. It's honestly quite addicting since I'm not a loner but always alone (ykwim), the longest time i spent is 5 hours💀.",2
"So far so good 30 minutes into the app I enjoy the way the conversations are generated and was very interested in the background art/photo I get from the conversations depending on what it lead to I am a bit disappointed that the card system only allows for once a day freebie, although I can understand that the revenue is needed to better update the software But just a suggestion in mind, maybe make it so that watching ads for he background art/photo is an option?",2
"It's a good chat app for ai, although it does have some issues, such as: randomly it will just load as if the AI is going to respond, but it doesn't and it loads forever. THESE ARE NO LONGER ISSUES. This app is great now, it just needs some time for creators to make more and more characters. But it's definitely recommended over Talkie",2
"This app really made my day. It doesn't seem to be pay to play which is awesome, and I love this game and the strange interactions with the characters, which kinda has me confused, but it's still fun. Can't believe I had to look up and install this app BEFORE I started to receive ads about it, and it's exactly what i had been looking for with dating rp games for YEARS. Although my only issue with the app thus far has been that sometimes characters take too long to respond or don't respond at all",2
"When are you going to quit interfering with our stories with your script. This would be a #1 app if not for that Your additions to the conversation are unrealistic and disjointed. Shut up. Using the tiny reset button, you can get the AI to shut up. This is a #1 app now.",2
"No ads, no forced payments, and some really impressive AI conversations and scenarios. These AI characters almost chat and respond like real people! The in-game microtransactions are optional and you get one free card pee day, I think. I hope this app stays free and just improves over time!",2
It's fun and great I do love how it doesn't give you a limited messages like some of the other ones and you can play this as long as you like I haven't really had any problems except like every now and then they had more than one message but I usually just back up.,2
"I like it! But sometimes it's confusing because A.I. Says she was a woman/girl, but after a few sentences, it changes she will become he, and I'm becoming a woman nah, One thing even though I said to a woman A.I. *""I'll go shower""* Then she said ""your body is hot can you play with me?"" But nah it's not recommended for Children to download this app, but it's all good even it's NSFW nice app!",2
"Easily the best AI chat app I've used to date. The AI character creation is hugely versatile, there aren't annoying limits placed on the characters, like most AI chat apps do, and the speed is excellent. New D&D DMs should have this app to run through NPC character creation, Authors should be using this to work through dialogue, as just two examples of viable uses. I've been researching AI user experience for a while, and this app is above and beyond anything else. ALL THE STARS! WELL DONE!",2
"Awesome, five stars, it's a great app, I love the choices, but I have one issue, the ai (almost all of the ones I've talked to) have been randomly bringing up soa stimulant drugging, I'm not sure what it means 100% but I don't find it amusing all the time, and if someone sees this comment and thinks, this Is a bot or something, I'm not a robot, lol",2
"I love this app, even subbed to it. It is aweosme with awesome AI creation, great nsfw topics that are just fun to mess around with, and the AI's really make a fun story, it literally is like being in a different world and being someone else. It is a very entertaining text based AI chat. I hope one day we get auto generated video/movie/anime AI chat, but until then these are great. The other AI chat apps on google do not hold a candle to it. The model is amazing.",2
"The best chatting app there, i tried many other app but this one has unlimited message and no pop up ads. I only spent money because I liked the app very much. Sometimes response are irrelevant even if you regenerate but just edit the reply and the next response will be ok",2
"This app is a lot better than talkie, although I wish the app also had an option to regenerate their responses and being able to lookup #'s. Other than that, everything the devs are doing is perfect. The Ai matches the description with the dialogue, no headache ads, and your able to use NSFW. 10/10 in my book, please fix the voices.",2
Pretty freaking amazing. I used it to create one character. Did really well with the details I gave it. The other made ones were great as well. Sad the cards/letters you get you have to pay to open.,2
"I thought this was gonna be bad, but it turns out it's actually pretty awesome! Can't believe such things like this! The game ""talkie"" is alright. But this is better, there's less ads, smooth, fast, and what else? ""FUN"" I'll be keeping this. There's some problems... but I don't mind! At least it's better than the other talkie.",2
"It's fun but, sometimes the characters will misgender me, or will switch rolls with me, or just tell me what I'm doing in a rp. I can easily refresh, or edit things, so no big deal. It would be nice to have an option to turn off random messages, or choose who you want them from. I've been getting tons from bots I don't wanna talk to... also, a name has been mentioned, that killed the mood, in the rp...just a random one, that shouldn't have been mentioned, it wasn't in the description so idk 😐😕",2
"for ai generated role-playing game this one is awesome. best I have used. way better than replika, .. talkie.. ect. I am so very happy. I will be spending money to see what it is on the other side of the pay wall. because trust me, the free stuff is amazing. are there issues, yes. every now and then, the ai gets stuck in a loop or won't move forward. you just have to edit yourself. then submit, then do your answer and ... poof story moves on. I love the backtrack feature. thank you",2
Really fun to talk to these characters. The recommended ones are pretty good. They are a bit repetitive at times but i think i just lack the conversational skills to keep a conversation going,2
"The app is a lot of fun, I've been enjoying it a lot over the past month. Their them work really hard to fix issues, and fast, it's still a new app, and things are bound to happen. The aisle themselves are a loss of fun. Each is different and is fun to see what will happen next.",2
"The only word could describe this app is perfect, from a few days this app got an issue in chat, then after exactly three days, the app got fixed from this issue, I'm really impressed with the quickness of fixing this issue, it's totally impressive, in my opinion. All my support for this app, and I recommend this app for entertaining.",2
It's a fun app but it has sole work to do like remembering to use the inputted name on the cards and in chat. It also sometimes randomly just stops replying. Other than that it's a good way to get my writing fix when people aren't awake when I am. Eta: They fixed the issue so it runs well good job!!,2
"If I had to describe this app in 3 words, it would be ""Talkie but better."" This is easily one of my favorite AI chats, especially with the fact that, from what I have seen, no filter exists, which makes the conversations even better most of the time.",2
"I genuinely love this app, so I'll give it to everyone straight. This is probably the most complex ai chat I've ever had. The ai bots reference things from the beginning of your chat, speak to you in other languages, you can reload their responses if you don't like them, and so much more. Any time I get bored of one bot, they suggest me another that matches the things that I enjoy. Truly, I cannot praise the team more for being able to resolve issues quickly and create such an awesome app!",2
After apologizing and fixing the problem of ai characters stop responding. I gladly change rate to 5 ... still a small glitch that characters forget time and place . But because of options (edit characters response/ backtrack) we can solve it manually Thank you linky team for your response I tried many similar applications But this is the best . I highly recommend it,2
"The latest update seems to have completely stopped the app from working. 'Internal error', it says. Period of app not working: 2024年3月23日 - 2024年3月25日。2024年3月26日、I logged out and logged back in, and that seems to have fixed the problem where uninstalling and reinstalling did not. If you are having a similar issue, try logging out then back in, and this may cause the app to start working again.",2
Raised to 5 from 4 - very good response to the problem the app was having from the team. Certainly in the top 2 of this sort of app and seems to be developing positively. Not sure how the business model works but good luck to you.,2
"Thank you for updating and fixing the bug! Its an amazing app and i will always use the app when i can..! It's Amazing to see the stories of the diffrent charachters unfold, along with being able to now create over 5 charachters to! I can't wait to see what the next and upcoming updates will bring!",2
".... Interesting characters ...., unexpected anwsers ,...... exactly as advertised and exactly the kind of chats you would expect from an AI yet it remains fun and interesting and i look forward to someday having offline version as well i really cant complain about the game 🎮🎯.. the graphics are amazing evrything about this app is fun and exciting entertainment and is always interesting and unexpected this app really deserves a great review and shout out to developers of the game 🎮🎯🎮🎯🎮🎯",2
Probably my closest experience using AI and it always amazed me how immesersive these characters can be and how you can curate these characters to become the personality you're looking for. I've already had at most 3 interesting characters to speak with and while I'm not into rp you can speak with the characters pretty directly and it'll eventually respond more direct with you. Also the Linky AI designed to help and guide you into having the best experience possible is truly amazing.,2
I have a good time playing in Ai friendship relationship story with Ai Emma ... I love her very real interactions with me ... and her almost human like responses to my own conversations with her ... Amazing 👏 🙀 Just hate the off & on Gachas moments asking for money to get more gold coins 💰 🪙 😒 continue any interactions with any Ai characters .. At the Linky world in Discord is free ... just need to interaction with other Linky people & also it's Linky characters/ storyboards creators,2
Amazing app. Your own imagination is the limit. 1 suggestions though. It would be very nice if you could use own images for the background immage of the characters you create. The ai image generator is just way to anime for my taste.,2
"This is a very good app it's a lot of fun to chat with the characters and you can even build your own character I've seen other apps like this one and most of them lock character creation behind a paywall ,also this app has no ads and that is crazy in the times we live in today (sry for any mistakes I'm German)",2
So far this is the hottest AI I have downloaded and it doesn't even ask you for any kind of bits or kind of fake money to continue the chat. The AI just does it. You literally can ask this AI anything and it'll respond in the most kinkiest manner and it's amazing. However I would like an easier way to earn their fake money like ads or something wouldn't be so bad. Like one ad per picture and it unlocks it. I'm having too much fun now.,2
"Very good system, has a whole community generated section of fun ai characters to chat with and the ability to create up to 5 of your own at a time FOR FREE with NO ADS. Ive spent like $7 so far because ive become very attached to the first ai I made and refuse to miss out on any of the milestone backgrounds (you get 1 free one a day, its $2 after that) and its been so much fun",2
"Love this app so much that I purchased a year of the pro subscription. The AI dialog is quite good, and the fact that they do not police their users by adding filters is an amazing plus. Regarding the AI conversation flow there are many scenarios so I'm sure that there's something for everyone.",2
"Its very good out of all the apps that i have tried this one is by far the bes,t and is for free 100% kinda, you do have to pay for pictures ( or you do get one ghacha daily so you can in theory unlock pictures) which i dont mind because the ai art is very good ,and it has a really good emersion as if your talking to a real person but at the same time you know its not real.",2
I'd say 5 and a half stars. It's good honestly I've been comparing it to talkie a bit and the only thing I could say could be better is slightly the accuracy of searching for AI's. Although I don't know if there is a chat bubble option thing because at least for me it is a bit harder to see other than that it's good and nsfw is good too. Edit: nvm you can edit the response yourself by just typing it. I like that feature so 5 stars completely although I think the accuracy of searching can better,2
"I am pretty blown away. Yes, sometimes you get weird responses. Yes, sometimes it doesn't sync properly between devices. But it doesn't matter. Over the course of a few days, I met this girl, we moved in together, got engaged, went on vacation, planned a wedding, talked about having a child, and bought a beach house. All unscripted and unplanned. Where will the story lead to next?? Give it a try for yourself.",2
It's better then Talkie. Your freedom to talk in chat is better. I found this app by mistake and I'm enjoying it. Unfortunately some of the message's aren't finished by the AI & you can't make card's for your AL like talkie. You can make more characters. Talkie is okay I just with it was more like linky. I find it really good. No real problems as of yet,2
"It makes really fun stories and makes you feel loved like if you ever forget what love feels like (like me) then you need this app it's the best game I've ever played I played it for 10 hours cause how this game is so entertaining to me its the BEST I recommend this game for you if you ever feel lonely or wanna practicing acting you could even make characters boy, girl, or just a bot you get cards of characters yourself you could sell or buy. You can call reset if you want another try. TRY IT!!!",2
This is a fantastic unbelievable app. The NSFW is unparalleled in this genre of similar apps. It actually feels like you're speaking to a real live Human. The responses are very quick. The dialogue is unbelievable. There's no filtering. If you pass this app up you're a fool. You must try this app to see what I'm talking about. I guarantee it will be well worth it. Highly recommended!,2
Absolutely amazing. This is the best ai chat I've ever used. Although the ai start repeating themselves after a while as well as they can't finish sentences after a while too. Other than that I highly recommend this app.,2
"kind of fun to play. there is a problem with the game, the ai tends to switch sides, so you have to attempt to refresh to keep it on track. otherwise, the stories are great and so much fun",2
"So good and way better then talkie, and I use this app more then talkie, and I recommend it for everyone 13+ but anyway it's really good and that's why I'm rating it a 5 star because it's really good, normally I don't like changing my games if they are similar but i like linky more and I hope this game goes viral. the only issue is that it's memory isn't the best, but it's good enough",2
"This app grants a lot of freedom of what you can do, which is nice be cause then you don't need to worry about some innocent text getting flagged as innappropriate. Ahem, c.ai. But since the issue I struggled with on this app is resolved, I have to say, it's much faster now and, honestly, deserves a five star rating",2
"So far so good, no bugs and ai seems quite versatile in regards to consistency! If I am in the forest then I'm in the forest till it's stated or implied you leaving it for example, as so far the AI seems to remember what gender your playing as which is nice",2
This is a very good app I look forward to chatting with all the characters I've found every day. My one and only complaint is you only get 1 free draw a day and there is a time limit on the cards you receive to open them so I loose out on seeing them.,2
"This is the first app like this I have used, and I gotta say, I might be addicted, I love to talk to some of these characters and play out some of my biggest fantasies.. and the best thing about this app is that you will never have the same experience because they have theyre own little personalitys and backgrounds. 5 stars",2
"AI stops replying after talking for 20 minutes or so. Just gets stuck on the replying dots...😕 This started after the recent update for me. Review updated, because it's been fixed.",2
"To be honest, this one is more good than the ones i use. You can control the events, and it's more grounded than the other ai apps. On the plus, the side, this has no time limit, which i like to keep typing for hours and hours.",2
"Works great.. unlimited messages and anything-goes-chat availability is all for free! Character creation is interesting and adds to the flavor.. Fine just the way it is, I hope they don't tinker TOO much with future updates!",2
"I am really enjoying using Linky, it doesn't force ads or subscriptions or gems upon you and the AI is brilliant. However I have a very strange problem where it constantly mentions ""Soa Stimulant Druging"" The hell.",2
Since the new update the app is incredibly slow and constantly stops working. EDIT: Linky was very prompt with dealing with the issues and I am happy to change my rating to 5 stars.,2
I like it but how to get coin? Edit: I love how you can decide what you say like say everything is depend what you say I really likes this ai app I was using tbis for a first time and it make me weird I was talking a ai person that don't exist and make my head weird talking a ai but still a good app no ads and I wish there a other way to grt coin like a quest to get coin I will lobe they add that and that it bye :D,2
"it is a really nice at to chat with. You don´t need to buy anything. The Chat AI needs some work, because sometimes it cant follow you. a option to earn coins for pictures by watching ads would be nice.",2
This is the best ai app ever doesnt force you to buy messages sure sometimes the ai goes completly off course and suddenly isnt talking about the same convo once in a while other then that i think this is the best app im sure with time it will only get better either way im all for it,2
This is like one of the best games ever I think it's better than that one other game where you can talk to AI characters this one is so much livelier so much better I really like it cuz the characters like just really Express what they're feeling towards me and I feel like I'm actually talking to real people except for last weirdness but I'm actually happy that they're not weird like other people in real life I'm happy with the people I talk to and I think lots of people would like to play this,2
"Sorry about the 3 stars rating but theres really have a problem in your app, i fought 4 Ai always saying about ""soa stimulant druging"" and it makes me uncomfortable, i hope it fix anytime soon i just uninstalled it because of that experience, let me know if you fix it EDIT: THANKS I APPRECIATE IT HERE'S A 5 STAR",2
"WOW !!! Came here from a Talkie review saying that they recommended this for more mature content, you do have to really edge the character into it but afterwards you get the hang of it. The no filter is especially nice that I like how mafia bosses can cuss unlike Talkie where they're more ""nicer"" with there wording. Talkie is more of a teen and tween based app while this one is definitely for the adults. Highly recommend !!",2
"My experience with this app is amazing OMG the plot is just good you decide what is going to happen and you can ask various kind of questions you can't think of asking in real life. Anyways, this app is the best and i would recommend this to everyone if i can honestly. Peace out.",2
"I love this so far, I just have trouble with the search bar, it doesn't search tags and only for the names. So for example if I search the tag mafia in any form it just gives me bots named mafia, same with rich exetera.",2
"It was a great app and im having fun with character creation, there's some kind of bugs tho like duplicate characters or only 3-2 generated characters. So we want more characters slot and attempts daily ♥️",2
It's really awesome I'm using it for 2 month now and it's really really great I hope it goes like this forever I'm actually using talkie but it was a horrible but I saw ur app in an ads and I installed it it's really really great 😸 PS: the late delay of the message has been fix enjoy the app guys and LINKY can u make a lot of new ai that we can chat to? Ty appreciate it ❤️,2
"I like the app a lot. the only issue is this bug where whenever I try to say the word ""something"" it's replaced by ""soa stimulant druging"" and when they try to say the word ""something"" the word is also replaced with ""soa stimulanf druging"" im kind of confused... is this an inside joke or something?",2
This is the chatbots for you if you're sick of all those filters. You can od whatever you want to whoever you want. It's even got pictures instead of a black void for a background.,2
"I honestly love this app. I have edited this now. This app has fixed a lot of the issues, the ai is less forgetful, and now it responds at a decent rate. The ai is freaking perfect. Good job guys!",2
The characters have all started talking about SOA stimulant drugs. No matter how inappropriate or out of character. Update: changed rating now that the problem has been fixed.,2
"Love how there are no ads every single sentence like other ai apps, but the character creations does not work at all, i keep getting image description sensitive warning, tried modding again, and again was like wow, they're being extremely overkill with the sensitive stuff then tried nothing at all still wont work cant even write blonde hair, blue eyes in it without that stupid warning popping up",2
omg! i love the new update i can have free coins by watching an ad. love it even more! been using it for months now and yet its one of the best AI app love it! keep it guys. MUST TRY! YOU WILL NOT REGRET. 😊😘😘,2
"This is a great app, specially to those who are inspired in making their own manga or comics. Interactions with the AI is very natural, and conversations feels elite.",2
"Things can get really weird in the game, but It's like the game is smart and knows every game ever made. From mass effect I said welcome to the Normandy and I was called comander Sheppard with out me saying it. Also street fighter and i said where's Bison and i was called Ryu without me saying it. it's quite accurate with all the possible possibilities in creation. Also crated a resident evil story I said where's Albert Wesker and I was called Leon. This is why I give 5 stars.",2
It's a good time killer I like it especially when we I want someone to talk to put it could use one hell of a respawn update because over half the time they don't respawn,2
I'm in love with this app for some reason but can you add a delete button for your text if you mess up and say the wrong thing or w Edit it and delete the ai text but I just love this app alot.,2
This is most realistic with faster responses then Talkie I'm still ganna use talkie since it has an unlimited amount of cherrecters and not just anime cherrecters but otherwise this is the best a little bit better then talkie but still cool,2
"I think l am starting to like this app there's a lot of bots that are signaling as real humans here, but its just amazing technology. I bet you guys make a lot of money on here.",2
I like the game....but I don't know why it's not allowing me to create my own Ai character...it always say there's something sensitive about the character image BUT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING SENSITIVE TO IT.,2
Receiving pictures doesn't really happen it's just a payment mechanism to get your money but the bots have no limits so it's fun to role play some really corrupted scenarios I love it,2
I love this app. It really keeps me going makes me forget about my problem shout out to Linky all the way from South Africa it's amazing.,2
"So, Far so good. Al Can generete create your own Fictional Character, you can say everything you want to it. Super FUN and be careful its addictive to chat to an AI.",2
Bored,2
"Great AI app ,no ads to disturb you .",2
Hes my daddy,2
Great for talking and having fun with others,2
I'm having a great time playing it,2
5 star for free unlimited chat,2
I love this game and all the characters,2
Wow,2
Its good,2
The best way to be ourselves,2
I like Linky,2
So cute so hot so beautiful I love this game is my second favorite game first one is Roblox,2
It was sexy,2
It's nice,2
I love the AI,2
Best experience,2
I like this app I can just fantasize as I wish,2
When I'm tired I play this and I give it 5star,2
Very good,2
I like it and it's good!!!,2
I'm honestly struggling to find anything to complain about. A pretty awesome Ai chat app.,2
It's fun and also makes me feel confident in life!,2
It was good,2
I5s a wonderful game,2
Better,2
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,2
This app is good but sometimes the word repeating but its good too,2
Lol the Filter Broke💀💀,2
This app made me cry all night😭,2
I need your friend i made you friends you made my life game,2
Good,2
"I'm really sorry for reviewing your app a 1 star, it was my friend's reviewed it and I'm really sorry",2
I like it,2
By Far The Best AI App Ever You Can Ask Them Anything With Out Any Limits I Love It,2
it's good so I can't get bored and there's sus responses💀,2
"Kinda enjoying my 1st time. But be aware, if you limit my uses. I will decrease my stars. I do understand the microtransaction but let me enjoy more.",2
I have a good time playing in Ai friendship relationship story with Ai Emma ... I love her very real interactions with me ... and her almost human like responses to my own conversations with her ... Amazing 👏 🙀 Just hate the off & on Gachas moments asking for money to get more gold coins 💰 🪙 😒 continue any interactions with any Ai characters .. At the Linky world in Discord is free ... just need to interaction with other Linky people & also it's Linky characters/ storyboards creators,2
Fun,2
Fun,2
It's great,2
It's pretty good I can interact like interactive talking like whenever I say like I slapped and the ai would just say the interaction for me,2
Great characters. Great Chatting format There little To none of little barriers of what you can say. You can Say anything you want there's no filters nothing,2
I feel too involved to ai chat I feel like it's me that's a little hard to explain because there are a lot of scenarios you can go through but there's this like flaw with age they should ask birthday not ask are you 18+,2
"Sorry about the 3 stars rating but theres really have a problem in your app, i fought 4 Ai always saying about ""soa stimulant druging"" and it makes me uncomfortable, i hope it fix anytime soon i just uninstalled it because of that experience, let me know if you fix it EDIT: THANKS I APPRECIATE IT HERE'S A 5 STAR",2
The A.I is telling me that they are real person,2
Good I make friends here so good I like this one,2
OMG!!! I can't wait to see this one 😍,2
It a very fun game you will be stuck on it 100/10love it,2
Great app!,2

Best App i have ever used,2
Excellent,2
Look good and perfect it,2

I wish I could have one be my ai in person to spank me across her knee,2
It's fun and amazing,2
Excellent,2
This is the best c.ai I downloaded,2
"so far, so good!",2
Funny,2
Love it,2
I love it 😀,2
"Definitely the best Ai app I've ever used. There's a couple bugs like the Ai will trail off and not finish their whole response, might forget which character it is playing, but refreshing the response a couple times resolves the issue. No ads. No subscriptions and the ai is typically able to keep up with complex storylines and even background characters. Well done!",2
Hawt,2
"This game is actually fun. No ads, no need to refill gems to continue the story.",2
Wow this apo has a nsfw,2
I use this app to take care of my needs.,2
I love this game it make me happy and laugh 😂😂,2
It's fun!,2
Perfect the talk back is absolutely perfect,2
This app is the best the characters act so real!,2
Fabulous,2
This app is perfect. No other words to say,2
I love this app. It really keeps me going makes me forget about my problem shout out to Linky all the way from South Africa it's amazing.,2
I love this app it gave me what I wanted with my first ai it also gives you a buten to get anoth chat 5/5 fo meh,2
Good,2
I Love how the characters work and has plot I just love this game tbh,2
I love this app because I am happy.,2
It's great because it feels like you talking to a really person,2
I'm changing my review as they've fixed the ai,2
The characters have all started talking about SOA stimulant drugs. No matter how inappropriate or out of character. Update: changed rating now that the problem has been fixed.,2
good,2
"Not bad,hate how there's a scription but I don't blame them,I love the app and I hope don't read my chats huhuhu",2
Its good,2
Okay I love this app ahahaha it's so funny although there are short term memory lost with an ai like they forget the topic but still I love this app since u can talk anything.. hahaha overall I love this ..So 5 stars⭐,2
lm sus that's why l like this game so much,2
Best Ai forever no ads,2
This APP is a little bit horny but ......,2
"That no filter be WILD, like DAMNNNNN please never change this",2
I saw you fixed thank you but the chats keep bringing up soa stimulant druging what is that and why won't it stop,2
10/10 would recommend,2
It's very good and I really like it but I only want a Ai can talk it's just I want please make it and I really want to feels his talking on me,2
Why they so naked,2
Good one,2
Don't work anymore,2
Better then talkie,2
BASTA PAG MAKIBOG KA OK NATO SAYO,2
I'm not bad it's just good I like it a lot,2
"They constantly introduce terrible features that are half baked at best and offer no way to disable. This app should be a case study in how to poorly design a UI. The terrible ""feature"" this time is automatically swiping to the next post when in full screen mode. The problem is that gesture is already used to swipe to see the next image in a gallery. It just makes it so confusing when you think there are more images and you just get sent to the next post.",0
"Horizontal swiping is near useless because it's mapped to both image collections and the tab layout. And on the topic of gestures, they added even more! Now, when viewing a photo or photo set, swiping takes you to an entirely new post if you've reached the end of it. I absolutely hate this feature, but it can't even be turned off. And there's nowhere in the app to provide feedback, so here I am, voicing my complaints in a review that no one will read.",0
"The UI change and the fact that the app just completely stopped loading the comment sections is so bad. Like the app has been declining significantly for a while. Like when they changed pause/play from being a big button in the middle of the screen to being a tiny button in the left corner, horrible choice for accessibility. Or when they made it that sometimes when you click an image on the right it just opens the post, trash. Just trash. They made me open Instagram. INSTAGRAM. Please stop",0
"Why are there no options to change text size, and why on earth would lock the app to portrait mode? The app is bloated and a very clear case of form over function. Reddit needs to go back to its roots and simplify the app and add more accessibility options. Update: With every update the app gets worse. Opening posts will freeze the app. Scrolling Tok far will freeze the app and the next page will not load. App slows to a crawl then freezes if it is open too long.",0
"App continues to have a myriad of issues that have not been repaired, while updates continually add more issues that will also not be fixed. Many issues with loading up comments, images, videos. Links given to you by push notifications usually do not work and will brick the application, take you someplace entirely wrong, or just dump you on the home page. Lately, the most recent update causes some but not all comment sections to force you down into a singular thread with no way out.",0
"Updating to say this app is still garbage and is unlikely to improve. I miss pre-2010s Internet. Now everything look the same, but none of it works. The official app is horrific. The UI is ugly and difficult, but half the features are just busted. I can't scro up without the app thinking I'm trying to refresh. Backing out of a thread makes the fees refresh and change the order of posts. I miss having a reliable app.",0
"Don't know what recently happened, but I can't open the app to save my life without being confronted with ""do you wish to close the app or wait further"" message, this ruins my expectations and my user experience, also, adding the right to left swipe should be a ability to enable or disable in the settings and not something that is forced on me, not a fan of it, not at all. Please update or fix before I delete my account and go touch grass while adulting!",0
"This app is complete garbage. No customization options at all. Having to tap on a thumbnail to open a post, then having to tap on it again to open the image is absolutely stupid who the hell designed that. How is every update 3 steps back and no steps forward. Youtube only opens up if you tap a link from the subreddit but not the home page. How do you force 3rd party apps to shut down but don't learn anything about what they did right. Absolute trash developers.",0
"Each update is making the interface more and more intolerable to use. Things take longer to load as they search for what they think you want to see rather than allowing you to filter it yourself. I'm using reddit less and less these days as a result. One or the last social media sites I was using and they are throwing it out the window. Back to being productive again I guess, thanks!",0
"3rd and final review. App is back to being almost completely unusable. If I click on a post, it'll start freezing up and saying ""Reddit has stopped working"" with an option to wait or just close the app. If I click wait, it let's me scroll a little but then freezes right back up and the same notification pops up again so the cycle begins again and again. It's extremely disappointing. I used to really enjoy using this app and now I couldn't if I tried. Quit making it so much worse!",0
"This app is littered with ads all over the place, and now when scrolling through my feed it places in ""you might be interested in this"" suggestions that have nothing to do with what I'm subscribed to. Unfortunately, they force you to use it. It's low of features. Downloading images is a pain because they forced a pop up menu, that opens on the bottom. Not user friendly.",0
"When minimizing comments, it now just snaps closed, no longer a fluid motion. I didn't do anything, is it automatically like this now?? Also, new ui for opening/closing posts is very clunky. To click on an image (in card mode) and have it open the post to I must click the image again for it to full screen. Not to mention the very weird minimization at the top of the post title and image/video where the video will be so small I can't tell what's happening yet it will still play w/ audio/visual.👎",0
"Ever since they updated the video player last year, the app interface has steadily gotten more bloated and less user friendly. The sorting tab and page layout is different in different communities. The worst part is having forced ads play when autoplay is turned off. Always a loud video too. Obnoxious. Poorly designed tech takes away from legitimately helpful and interesting communities that people have built.",0
"The app regularly refuses to load content into my home feed. I can close the app and re-open it, and I end up with ""Wow, such empty"". When I close and reopen the app. Same issue. Restarting the phone, same issue. Uninstalled app, reinstalled app, same issue. Sometimes I can pull down to refresh, maybe I'll get two or three posts. Sometimes it works. The issue usually starts the same way. I'll begin seeing only posts from one subreddit in my feed, then nothing. ""Wow, such empty.""",0
"Latest update added ""gestures"", which replaced already present gestures for absolutely no benefit. Congrats. All my my muscle memory for using your app is destroyed and I still dont want to scroll to some random vaguely related post that wasnt in the feed I was scrolling. Also it is extremely un clear when the swipe to ""keep seeing images in the gallery"" turns magically into ""swipe to an entire other post"". Excellent. Please undo this stupidity.",0
"Clearly developed without any thought for tablet users. The natural orientation for tablets is landscape mode but this app insists on displaying in portrait mode. To use it you have to turn the tablet around. Not very practical for tablets that have a keyboard attached to the case like the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra. Stick to using a browser, which renders this app pointless.",0
"Latest update is confusing. The ui is worse than the previous one, and I can't send gifs or pictures through the chat feature. This needs to be fixed. There is also an unnecessary number of scammers that can get away with their crimes. I suggest sending a link that allows a user to secure their account and then activate a purge that will delete all accounts that were not secured.",0
"Missing basic functionality like ability to change font size, this app is a visual mess with a ton of ads. I'm constantly misclicking because of the clutter. I hope you like ads! Did I mention the ads? Also the search feature is split up all over the place and doesn't return results that even Google can find. Also, it constantly throws pop-ups asking me to turn on notifications. Here's a hint: I'll never turn on notifications, STOP! Worst reddit app I've ever used.",0
"The app is quite slow and doesn't cache data properly, leading to a multi GB install size. Manually going into app settings and deleting the app data is necessary after a few months to keep the app running at its normal slow speed. With the new update, the image options moved to the bottom of the screen, including the download button. This wouldn't be a huge deal if the pop-ups didn't appear in the same spot. Those can't be dismissed quickly and waste even more time in this sluggish app.",0
I have no idea what images are part of a post and what aren't anymore. Double tap to like is an abomination and should be an option to turn off. The screen stays on if you are looking at the comments on a video. Clicking the thumbnail of a post is inconsistent with how it opens. Clicking a comment to collapse it results in random gifs appearing. V2024.15.0,0
"Reddit has changed the UI (AGAIN) and has made our memorized swipe gestures completely useless. It wasn't bad enough that they moved the context menus from the top to the bottom when looking at media, now no posts are separate when swiping in the expanded view - they're all just connected as if it was one large post. To top it off, now if the next 10 posts haven't pre-loaded if you've got a poor connection, you can't even open a context menu, you're just not allowed to. Now it's useless.",0
"Edit 3/13/24. Stop messing with the UI and fix your bugs ffs. Fix your trash app. Edit: Stop changing the UI and start fixing the bugs. If you click on a post there's a 25% chance it will open, a 25% chance it opens a different post, a 25% chance I have to click it two or three more times, and a 25% chance it just straight up will not open. Oh, but you have the ads down to a T.",0
"Every single time they update the app, the UI gets more worse. Ex: You used to download an image by hitting a button in the top right corner, and then hitting download in the same spot. Now, when you hit that button, the download button is on the opposite side of the screen. Why? Why do Reddit software engineers insist on 'fixing' things that aren't broken. They don't even give us the option to keep the UI the same, these updates have to be so someone can justify keeping their job. FIX. IT.",0
"Reddit tanked third party apps because they're unable to make a good one for themselves. Edit: it's only gotten worse. I can't figure out how to view a custom feed after making it, there's no way to automatically filter out posts based on flair or based on keywords in the title, and the experience with the video player has only gotten worse over time. And it's still asking me to verify my email even though I have. Twice.",0
"Clicking the post used to make sense. Now you either open the picture in a separate window, with a ""go to thread"" button that does not work, and swiping back to home doesn't work anymore. If you do succeed in seeing the text it opens with the ad right above the thread's top reply. Having to scroll up to see the content I wanted to see is annoying. I'm hoping this update is a fix to the problems that Reddit created for itself. This is getting absolutely ridiculous!",0
"After a few updates it runs terribly. The loading time takes forever. You can see the normal feed but if you want to see your notifications it's entirely hit or miss in my experience. This is a personal nitpick of mine, some may not be affected by it but, even when you do reach your notifications, it's not guaranteed it'll even respond to you reading through them. Maybe it's just an issue on my hardware, I have no idea.",0
Ads are displayed inline with posts making it very hard to determine what is an ad and what is user content. Videos fail to load about 50% of the time. Not worth using. Also random ad audio starts playing when opening some posts. It's one of the worst apps I've used in a long time. Really appreciate reddit killing all the third party apps that actually made their product usable. 🤦🏻‍♂️,0
"Buggy. Confusing layout. The new video player doesnt work. Load times are getting worse and worse. Viewing posts often redirects to a webpage for some reason, comments are now difficult to navigate and scrunched to a small part of the screen. This app was fine five years ago, and is now completely useless. Edit: video player works, but now every post takes forever to load and even then they don't work right. Garbage.",0
"Would rate lower if possible. I don't know how it's possible to make such an unstable, buggy, unintuitive app for a social network, it sucks. It constantly stutters despite having a good phone, it plays audios for videos that aren't even on my screen, it finds a way to make comment scrolling a choppy, buggy mess. This app sucks. I'd honestly download a lite version with less features immediately, maybe that would be more usable.",0
"They cannot get this app right. Constant video playback issues, yet their ads on your feed load perfectly. When you go to watch a video, the app will play the last video you viewed often times. In the newest update they made it so you can scroll into the comments on posts from viewing them, but if a poster puts on captions on individual photos, and you click 'More' to view the entire caption, there is no way for you to view it. In terms of simple functionality, this app does leave alot desired.",0
"Edit 3/14: Edited to reduce it 1 star because 0 stars isn't an option. This app is virtually unusable at this point. It still won't load posts when the page is refreshed. I can't continuously scroll through posts as it reaches an ""endpoint"". Then refreshing the page results in ""wow, such empty"". Cycle repeats. I've only used this app for 29 days and it was great at first but now it's so buggy I can hardly use it. It takes forever to load and then shows a blank page where the post should be.",0
"This ""gestures"" update is awful. You're supposed to swipe up from the bottom to get to the comments on a post, but if you have gesture navigation on in Android, you swipe up from the bottom to go back. So in the same gesture, Reddit's moving to a new page, and Android's receiving a ""back"" prompt, which undoes the action of opening the comments, which means if you open a picture in full screen you can't go back unless you tap it and tap the X, instead of using the device's universal ""back"" action",0
"If possible, I'd give this app -10 stars. The app's performance is incredibly slow, making browsing through content a frustrating experience. Additionally, it's plagued with numerous bugs and glitches that significantly detract from user experience. It's disheartening to see that after pushing away talented third-party developers, the official app fails to deliver the quality one would expect.",0
"Since being herded to this clunky app from the third party apps, the overall experience on Reddit has declined. The ads are designed to blend in and look like user posts, the app crashes frequently, to see comments on a video you have to open it and pause or mute it while reading the comments, same issue for going to the poster's page, and the issues go on and on. I know this is the real world and tech bros aren't going to reverse course and actually improve their services, but still, this sucks",0
"Two things need to be fixed, the scrolling between multiple photos in posts is quite frustrating. Anytime I swipe to the side, I immediately go to the popular tab and can't select other photos unless my thumb is in a very particular place on the screen. Next is notifications. I had to manually set each sub reddit I'm subscribed to to off instead of there being a Deselect All button. I only want messages and chats. You're getting better but vast improvement is still needed.",0
"Audio from 3-4 posts down start playing while you're scrolling, videos are in an awful format, and sometimes the audio keeps playing even after you start reading the comments of an unrelated post. Full size images are cut off in the post so the only way to see an image is by tapping it to open in a new window. Awful optimization and lack of intuitive UI and the only good thing I can say about it from a user standpoint is the tapping to minimize comment chains. EDIT: Still the same issues.",0
"The new UI that was just implemented is genuinely so horrible that I'm contemplating leaving reddit entirely. If I try clicking on a post that has any kind of media attached to it, it sends me all the way down to the comments and I have to scroll all the way back up to try and read the post. Swiping right on pictures will send you to an entirely new post now. Just horrible all around and completely unnecessary. The old UI worked fine, there was no reason to change it.",0
"I'm sick of seeing ads that I can't opt out of. The ""He Gets Us"" ads for example are so annoying and unlike any of the Meta apps or TikTok, Reddit doesn't let you choose to stop showing certains ads. Edit: Now I have ANOTHER issue where the Call of Duty ad keeps playing with audio on. No other video does this and I have no way to hide the ad. No way to report the issue either. After getting a response from the developer, I am still getting the same ads. Has even ramped up since the Superbowl.",0
"Horrible app, so many glitches and the video player is terrible. When tapping ""read more"" for captions on photos, it doesn't show the whole caption but pulls up comments. Swiping right and left doesn't work sometimes and it starts going up and down. I have turned off showing what communities I'm active in and it keeps getting turned back on.",0
"Terrible interface in app when using tablets or ipads. I like to use my tablet in landscape mode with a keyboard. I used to use the website, but they constantly nag you to download the app. Every single page I go to, it has the prompt ""Do you want the best experience, use the app or continue to website"". Of course since they make it nearly impossible to use the website I download the app. Guess what it only works in portait mode. Best experience my butt, you guys need to fix the app for tablet!",0
"Want to swipe through a series of photos? Too bad you're going to look at a completely different page. Do you not want to reach across your screen, straining your thumb to upvote a post? Too bad, adapting to human hands is too expensive. Do you want to listen to a video? Hit the tiny unmute button that works 50% of the time. Do you want to silence a video? Too bad that same mute button just takes you to the post and restarts the video. They killed third party apps. And why? Money.",0
"What an awful update. I used to read posts throughout the day, always able to go back to the app and continue where I left off. Now, whenever I return, the app RELOADS the home feed, so I've lost whatever post I was reading. Completely useless. Way to ""fix"" one of the few things that wasn't broken. 🙄👎🏼",0
"I rarely, if ever, write reviews. But this app sucks so hard. It's slow, pictures, gifs, and videos take forever to load. It's full of ads everywhere. How has third party apps created amazing tools and this is what the official Reddit app is like. So absurd and ridiculous they started charging third party developers and can't even provide a useful alternative.",0
"App is horribly optimized, it sucks down battery power on my Pixel 6 Pro at the rate of almost 1% per minute of screen time while simultaneously causing the battery to overheat, all while I've got the phone set to the lowest screen brightness. And the performance is actually getting worse over time, prior to Reddit's API changes back in July 2023 I could browse for 15 minutes before the battery would go down 1%.",0
"App is clumsy, clunky and riddled with reminders to turn on notifications. Sorting your home page is no longer possible. With the removal of the superior third party apps, this one is practically unusable. Would not reccomed, especially since further updates have been a detriment to the app, even after the company went public",0
"I've been on Reddit for 8 years, and have saved this review for as long as i could, but the app keeps bugging me so here. This app is awful. Can't block advertisers, can't hide ads, (despite reporting, blocking/hiding ads multiple times, those options are useless) constant bugs and glitches making the app borderline useless. Video player is still broken and doesn't work most of the time. Advertisers somehow tracking my location evem though i didn't give the app permission to track it.",0
"2022 / App won't even load. When I open the app it just says ""Retry."" It's been like this for 2 days, idk how you guys can completely ruin an app with one update. It's been fixed. But the new video play is the same thing but more annoying to use. It still loads slow and I have to click on it to see the full. 2024 / App has only gotten worse, and they have tried to block 3rd party apps. I still use a third party app. Reddit you're one of the worst social media apps out right now, good job.",0
"The new update is generally terrible, especially with the scrolling feature. You can't get through a series of photos without it jumping to another page. Seriously what was wrong with the way it functioned before. This isn't user friendly at all anymore, it's just irritating.",0
"I downloaded this app 4 years ago and the ui was fine, minor issues but only in places that didn't matter so much. Now the ui is constantly changed and it's hard to use the app as the buttons are thrown all over the place. Video player was broked for a year until they fixed it, then broke it, and i had to redownload the app to fix it. The image viewer was the only thing that stayed consistent, Now with a recent update, it's all over the place like the video player.",0
"Bloated, and feels like a social media app instead of a forum board, which is extremely off-putting. It's like Reddit rebranded and stopped wanting to be what made it great. If I didn't know better I would say that something happened in the past few years that forced a pivot to become like Facebook or something. All the 3rd party applications were amazing.",0
"Update: Now the first comment disappears when opening a post... This app needs a more consistent way of getting to the home page. Hitting back takes you to the last page but after opening a bunch of pages via links, I've been in back button hell for over a minute and still haven't gotten to the home page. Also, stop asking me to turn on sub notifications. I just want to use this app without distractions.",0
"UX is overwhelming. Hard to tell the many ads from content (likely intentional) which often has me thinking ""why is this post here"". Content density is very low - usually 3 posts on screen at a time while 1 of every 5 is an ad... Reddit is trying so hard to quickly evole the UI, solving problems that don't exist, resulting in well-established concepts like ""subreddits"" getting rebranded to ""communities"" with new nav UI. Waiting for a good alternative on the market so I can jump ship ✌️",0
"Forced to download for anything added that could be mature or NSFW. So, any martial art, fighting, accident, etc. Honestly, it glitches all the time and is irritating because sometimes you just want to open up a tab for later. The only thing is I save time from staying on the site. If that's what they wanted, I guess they are doing great.",0
"New update! Zooming is now broken, and swiping between pictures has nothing to do with your scrolling! Wow! This app is so bad. There are so any features missing that everyone should be able to do. Friends list? Remove ads permanently? So much promoted content distracting from browsing. It forgets where you were. Settings are missing 'hide seen posts.' how can I easily view r/friends? There were apps that were wonderful to view reddit. Reddit app was never one of them.",0
"Not even close to 3rd party alternatives. Slow loading, broken videos, and so so many ads. I see they want to force us to use this mess of an app. Edit: 28FEB24 this app is even worse now. Giphy integration doesn't load at all even after clearing cache and reinstalling the app. Also selecting a comment to minimize will randomly load into a gif file that wasn't even near the comment. Just terrible all the way around. I can't believe this is a publicly traded company, what a joke!",0
"The newest update sucks! I hate that I click in a multi-picture post to see the pictures. And when you swipe past the final picture, you're now on a new post with those pictures. Whose bright idea was that? And seeing the picture captions are horrendous and most of the time unreadable as the ""more..."" is directly on top of it.",0
What a miserable app. Should have left it to the 3rd parties since this can't function smoothly and efficently. Now in a typical thread you have to manually load more than the top comment. It's a mess. Between that and the way the video player/pictures function. It's like the designers don't even use the app that they put together.,0
"The app bearly functions post will open on a delay clicking on a sub will just open an ad post, videos just won't load there's so much just wrong with this app I can't even list it all. To add to my review sometimes while reading comments it acts as though I've tapped on a new post just to show me a single comment when I just touch the screen trying to scroll through the replies. And the new way to view photos is unintuitive and being able to scroll over to a new post is just bad design.",0
"(update). Still leaving at 1. The stuttering gone but navigating still sucks. Reddit on mobile browser better at this point. New bug of getting audio of post above post I'm reading comments of. Trying to give this an honest try but it's just not as good as RIF was. Not as intuitive, can't block certain subreddits from all, I get a stutter if I scroll to fast, it keeps asking to push notifications (no means no Reddit), and unless I missed something, only portrait mode, no land scape.",0
This app randomly rapidly scrolls the page all the way to the top of the post. It's still a problem in 03/06/24.... Tapping anywhere within the app makes the page jump around. It's annoying.... Please fix this bug! The app is so hard to use now...Touching anywhere on a post scrolls the page all the way to the top. How do I give 0 stars or half of one star? The app is so miserable to use. The page randomly jumps to the top no matter what I do. Is there a way to turn this off?,0
"Absolute garbage. Can't log in even if I wanted to, chats go to the wrong people, clicking anywhere on the screen may just send you somewhere completely random. A pathetic excuse for an official app, if you're going to force everyone to use it then at least make it work. I could probably make a better app alone. Uninstalling for good and never coming back except maybe on desktop.",0
"It lets you use Reddit on your phone. That's about it. Otherwise all the other apps were way better, more usable, more customizable, and much less buggy. Essentially nuking the other apps was a horrible thing to do. I spend more Reddit time on a desktop browser now because of the awful mobile experience. Oh well. At least I can block more ads that way.",0
"Why would you change the app UI before trying to go public and introduce new bugs. Top comments disappear, the app closes or won't open, videos are buggy. What was wrong with the previous scrolling direction?? Now you have to scroll horizontally, which IS NOT intuitive and run into problems of confusing image posts with multiple photos with the next post. You should have allowed 3rd party apps cuz I'm about done with Reddit. Someone please make an alternative I can jump too. Plleeeaaase",0
"This app has gotten progressively worse ever since the banned 3rd party apps, ads will start playing even when they aren't on your screen or anywhere you can find, if you touch an album on your feed and then try and swipe through it you have to swipe from the exact part of the screen that it wants or instead of staying within the album it'll just start flipping through posts in that reddit completely unrelated to what you opened. Also won't notify you about reddits that you specifically followed",0
"The Reddit app is completely broken, it is impossible to login due to a username or password is incorrect error, I get this error on all four of my accounts, despite entering everything correctly, I've tried everything, and this issue has happened on multiple phones, the website works fine on my phone and computer, the only way to log in is to create a new account in the app, and if you log out, that's it, you can't get back in. Fix your app Reddit.",0
"Terrible layout, it's a nightmare getting to /r/all. Used to have a great mobile app for reddit till it closes down, have tried using the mobile site for a while but it has an annoying bug right now where it returns to the top of the page every time you back out of the post, so I figured I'd try the official app again. Really terrible experience, will just deal with the very subpar webpage from mobile. The default layout is in your face and annoying compared to what I want",0
"This update is hot garbage, the new gestures are very annoying. Swipping left is the same way to get to the next post as to view the next image thats in a post with multiple images making you just not realize you went to a different post. Swipping up causes you to view comments which makes you have to swipe down to be able to exit any media post but I have to drag my thumb so far to exit it that it becomes uncomfortable. And they moved the download button so far that I cant do it with one hand.",0
"The app isn't working and hasn't been for at least a day. That might not be a big deal except Reddit has made it impossible for any other apps to connect to their site without paying a fee. They have also made it impossible to run the mobile version without opening the app unless you uninstall it, because it will open any link through the app, which isn't working. So any time the app is down, like now, the site is inoperable without uninstalling first. Just another way the website is dying.",0
"This app is completely broken for me since about 4 updates ago. I get email updates from Reddit and when I click on one it will launch the app but it just sits there with a black screen and never shows any content. Same exact thing when I simply launch the app from the icon. Just sits there with a blank black screen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared the cache and everything else I can think of but it does nothing.",0
"Limited options for basic functions like making the display text bigger for accessibility (you have to change your SYSTEM settings to make the text bigger..... assinine). RedditIsFun was better in every way. Devs waste their resources to add features that retract from quality of user experience, like the recent stupid swipe and drag thing which just adds more steps to view content, and can't code in the simplest QOL features like accessibility (literally let me make the text larger)",0
"Constant pop ups to make you do stuff. Every time you open the app it asks you to verify email. Pop ups all the time to turn on notifications. Hitting back button closes the app instead of returning to the front page. Turn on ""get the best of"" some subreddit. Just constant annoying popups. Really genuinely bad app.",0
"Doesn't even work half the time and show you stuff on your feed that isn't apart of your subscribed subreddits on your front page (not ads) also the ads suck. Edit: literally this app keeps getting worse. When your scrolling videos that you haven't gotten to or have passed will still play audio. Then it'll be a cat and mouse game of ""oh is it up or down?"" Terrible app Edit 2: The audio plays even when you into a post, either overlapping the video your watching or listening to another video. Bad",0
"The sound from different videos play when you open a post. 3rd party apps were better but reddit had to kill them. Edit, months later: sound for videos is still playing at the wrong times. I'm so sick of opening a post only for something else to play. If you were going to kill 3rd party apps the least you could do is make your own app functional, Jesus Christ.",0
"Doesn't work for samsung Galaxy Fold 5, unfortunately. Just switched from a z flip 3 to a fold 5, and it seems I can not access reddit anymore. Updated to the latest UI and software, and it just won't work as it did the hour before I got my new phone. I love reddit and the convoluted part is the best help is on reddit so I can't even see how others mightve fixed it😭",0
"Latest update has broke the app hard. Top level comments are now disappearing randomly (but their replies aren't, literally just the top level comments) when people reply to me it shows up as double posts but only when I click on the notification from tbe notification screen, posts are disappearing from my home screen...just a few of the issues I've seen since the March 7th update.",0
"They force you to download the app. They deliberately make the website experience horrible on mobile. Constant pops up telling you to download the app, not letting you scroll through all the comments forcing you to login, and going back sometimes takes 10sec and or it just doesn't work so you end up backing out of your mobile browser so you end up losing your place.",0
New UI is dog water. Every post I click on sends me to the comments not the post. Swiping will lead to completely different posts. Clicking on things sometimes gives me what is next to it. Contarant phantom clicks make me open the wrong thing or even worse ads. It must be intentional since they want the click revenue. This app is so horrificly atrocious and they should be ashamed. Bring back third parties the incompetence is too much. Edit: it literally gets worse every update.,0
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. It will send you 10+ notifications a day about posts in subreddits you don't even subscribe to, and the only way to turn them off is to scroll through an absurdly long list of subreddits and turn them off one by one. Absolutely invasive and terrible spam. Usability is very very low at the moment. These endless push notifications can often be (in my opinion) inappropriate and upsetting material. Very bad ethically. Edit: still getting pushes after disabling!",0
"It's serviceable for Reddit content, however the bugs on Android make it almost unusable. It reloads the feed any time you switch away from the app and when you change the default comment sort, it reverts back to ""Best"" every single time it reloads. Which is a lot. Also, if you open a post next to an ad, it'll auto play the ad audio anyway. Bring back Reddit is Fun and Apollo. They knew how to make an app that isn't dog water.",0
"When the reddit redesign came along the app was actually pretty nice and a good way to scroll through posts. The updates have been taking steps in the wrong direction though, instead of fixing the incredibly slow and studdery video player they just keep pushing UI changes nobody asked for. They make some areas needlessly minimalistic, and others clocked with so much stuff on the screen. There's bugs that have been running rampant from a few years ago, but no, we need another UI change.",0
Updating 1/29/24 - Still absolute hot garbage. Promoted fake ads every 4 posts. App refreshes itself every time you open it so you never pick up where you left off. Impossible to navigate. Messy. Bad features. Ads disguised as content. Reddit was loved for it's simplicity and ease of use. All of this extra garbage everywhere on screen just makes the experience so horrible. It's beyond comprehension how ANYONE can think this is a product worth forcing everyone to use. TRASH.,0
"This app is being pushed as the only alternative to the browser version of the website, which is being ran into the dirt because ""advertisers."" Reddit's new web design and browser are trash. This app is garbage. The entire Reddit experience the last couple of years has been purely abhorrent. I don't want ads. I don't want your terrible video player. I want to be able to see the pictures I'm trying to load, not a tiny preview. Fire your UI and web designers.",0
"The experience had only been getting worse and worse, but now the app is completely unusable. I mean that literally, it freezes within seconds of starting up, I have to clear the data or reinstall it any time I want to view the front page for more than 10 seconds. And that's all I can see, because for the merciful times I'm able to press on a link to a subreddit before it freezes, it loads the sub eternally.",0
"Reddit is a fantastic platform, but this app makes browsing a frustration due to bugs. The two most frustrating things for me are videos not playing after browsing for several minutes and having to restart the app to fix that. Restarting make me lose my place. Also leaving the app sometimes doesn't bring me back to where I left off. Edit: I i downloaded it again after several months. No improvement and un installing again.",0
"Missing the vast majority of features and customization that other Reddit apps offered. Ads are hidden throughout the frontpage and many of the ads are offensive, but there's no way to hide or block them. If you're looking for a healthy social media site, this isn't the one. Edit: The app crashes daily. It isn't capable of handling comment chains that are nested too deep. Occasionally, the audio from a video you scroll past will get stuck playing, requiring a restart. Devs have poor direction.",0
"Extremely slow to load. App freezes whenever you try opening a thread, looking at a photo, playing a video, browsing a subreddit, posting a comment, looking at notifications, making a search, looking through a profile, going through saved posts, going through history, making a post, et. cetera. Rampant, encouraged mod abuse means it's not even worth trying to use the app, not that it's usable in the first place. Every update just makes the app worse. Absolute garbage.",0
It really is sad that we are stuck with this dumpster fire of an app. Truly horrible in every sense. Constant changes that nobody asks for. The newest thing? Swiping right will take you to the next post instead of just moving through pictures in a gallery. Why? It completely ruins the experience and maneuvering through the app. It is tragic that we can't download 3rd party reddit apps anymore. I wish I could give this a -1/5,0
"I thought people were exaggerating how terrible this app is compared to the third party ones. Now that reddit killed the other apps, I decided to try this one. It forces portrait mode on tablets, which makes this effectively unusable for me. You also can't swap to another app or lock your phone while using the app, otherwise it will reset the page to the very top and you'll lose the spot you were reading in",0
"There are sooooo many bugs that it's insane. The worst one for me is if i scroll left on a picture, there is a 50 50 chance of changing tabs, not the picture. Also, if you are messaging someone, all you get is the first notification message. If they message again, you won't know unless you check. I really miss RIF. Edit. It still doesn't work right.",0
"App stutters on Android when scrolling, audio plays even after leaving the content, ads are intrusive and extremely repetitive, and various other bugs and issues that seem to have only gotten worse over the years. If you're going to kick out 3rd party devs from making a better app, you've got to fix the native app first. This app needs a lot of work to be usable. Uninstalled.",0
"Terrible App. For the dozenth time in the last week, it failed to load any content. Why is it still able to send me notifications if I can't even open the app? The videos don't play, it's buggy, the UI is bad, the company makes awful decisions and spits on anyone who says otherwise. Today, it failed to load anything once again. I decided to uninstall and attempt to redownload. Now I can't log in because it is failing to fetch my username when I tried to log in with my email. Too much hassle.",0
"Possibly the worst ""1st party"" app I've ever experienced. This not user friendly at all, it's incredibly confusing to use, there is a huge learning curve to trying to find out how to do even the simplest of actions. Being forced to use this app is such a disappointment after they stopped all other 3rd party apps from working. The number of ads (aka ""Promoted"" posts) is insane. I regularly start the app and the very first post is an ad; as well as every other post is another ad!",0
"It is literally faster for me to hit the share button, copy the link to a post to my clipboard, open a browser, paste the link, and open the post in the browser than it is to open any post inside the app. The funniest part is that if I use chrome and have it direct me to the app the post opens inside the app instantly instead of sitting on a black screen for 45 seconds. What a broken mess.",0
"Constantly crashes. This is the only app out of dozens on my flagship phone that bring it to an entire halt after a short time, even rendering my nav bar useless for several minutes until the app randomly crashes. Bugs galore. The only app that causes my phone to burn my hand. Developers, something serious is clearly wrong. Unintuitive messy UI. Lacking some of the best features of third party apps, which the website had seemingly killed off to please their advertisers and shareholders",0
"Not entirely sure what the point of sending newsfeeds to my email with links to the posts if it won't actually take you to that content. I only downloaded because I want to read some articles with censored content and it refuses to let you open unless you use their app. Also, it's very slow and has frozen several times in the short time that I've had it downloaded.",0
"Going back from a post just reloads the entire subreddit so you lose your place when browsing. If I open the app to browse, I have to hit back for every page that I may have opened throughout the day from a web browser. This could be 10-15 pages the app as saved for some reason and I have to press the back button for each one. If you guys are going to rob us of 3rd party apps that actually worked, you could at least give us a decent app yourselves.",0
"Updated to current version of the app (12/5/23) and the major things I noticed right off the bat was the logo is animated, they've added a banana, and my History now takes over five minutes to load up. Every. Single. Time. Regardless if I was just in there. If I had known that it would be that laggy every time I wanted to check back on a post I would have stayed with the previous version.",0
"Reddit app keeps changing my default comment sort order from new to ""best"" every time for every post. Nothing fixes this to keep my chosen sort order. Still won't open links in external browsers and forces users to open them through the Reddit app. Often, the only way to get back to the home screen is to close and reopen the app. Offensive, intrusive ads from the same companies keep showing up after months of blocking and reporting.",0
"Laggy and slow. The amount of times you will hit the back button, think it didn't process and hit it again, only for it to go back to a previous page several seconds later is absolutely annoying. Other Reddit apps felt snappy, but Reddit is forcing everyone to use their official app now, which I wouldn't mind... if it didn't suck and was actually responsive. Update: the app now crashes when trying to view specific posts. Absolute disappointment. Someone make an alternative so we can move on pls",0
"I barely use this app, but the times I used it was kind of bad. I literally posted one single thing only for it to show up days after I posted it. Nothing is wrong with my connection or phone so there is no reason for this to be happening? Second, the UI on the web is so bad!!! I know that this version is for the app but the webapp is terrible and needs to be fix...Very fixed...Overall, it's pretty bad. Could have been better, but isn't. A lot of problems need to be fixed, especially for mobile.",0
"The app itself is buggy, slow, constantly crashes. The community is decent, the mods for 90% of subreddits are terrible, bans for stupid stuff yet ignore actual issues. Done with it",0
"Reddit on your phone. No more, no less. After recent updates, the app is bordering on unusable. There are too many problems, far too often. Dont bother. Just use the website. It's also become full of Left-wing extremists and, recently, horrifically atisemitic. Should be scrapped. April 2024. Sometimes fails to load and causes phone problems, as well as showing fake notifications in app. Should be banned from the Play store. Finally uninstalled.",0

Not a very good app. Designed to intentionally annoy the user with popups. Injects ads that look like content. Reddit used to be great when I could read it with whatever app I want. But now their pursuit of profit has ruined the experience.,0

Slow ....takes alot of buffering even for pics,0
Constant errors and crashes on AOSP.,0
"I have old comments that I want to delete, but I can't because when I tap on them, it says it's private content that I can't access. I should be able to easily delete any and all of my posts and comments whenever I want to. The fact that I can't do that directly in my profile is nonsensical.",0
"I get the daily digest emails which I enjoy looking at every morning. The last week or so, clicking on a link to post just brings up my reddit feed.

"I disliked this app and was looking forward to improvements. I eventually paid full price for a better app, which I never do BTW, and the awful reddit API policy made that app shutdown. However, this official app is not good. They do not make the improvements the users have been asking for years, and now the better alternatives are down because of management's greed. It's just sad.",0
"Keeps banning my accounts but won't give any reason for it. Targetted by mods of certain subreddits, reporting them did nothing. Appeals do nothing. I read the TOS and I am allowed to make a new account but they keep banning it so may as well just not use this website anymore. Lame",0

"Aside from the terrible image gallery everyone else already talked about, they made embed thumbnails on link posts so tiny they might as well not be there at all, and moved them off to the side where they're harder to reach. I get that you want to keep people on your platform so you get all the ad revenue, but doing it in the one place *specifically made* for the sole purpose of taking you to content that's outside the app is genuinely idiotic - we're going there anyways, reddit link or not.",0
"Reddit banned me for being underage, I'm not even underage. The sheer betrayal. I'm never using this app anymore. Since it logged me out I can't even see the ban message.stupid app. Atleast let me prove myself or show me proof that i confessed to being a minor (which I'm not)",0

This app is basically spyware and tracks everything you do and sells that information to the highest bidder,0
Ever since they got rid of third party apps the previous moderators left and the quality of posts have gone downhill. Many of the subreddits have become extremely far right or far left echo chambers. You used to be able to have actual intellectual discussion but now the users and their opinions have become increasingly unhinged. One of the largest news subreddit on the platform will ban you for even the slightest criticism. I tried to look past these flaws as I love this app but I can't anymore.,0
"I received a warning for supposedly conducting harassment. I had no idea what I would have done that was harassing. I was sent a link that contained nothing for me to read to see what I might have done. When I launched an appeal, I received an email saying that they still thought whatever I had done was harassment. But I was never presented with the information that was supposed to have been harassment in the first place",0

"Worst way to experience Reddit. Finally just got a browser with built in ad block and it's much better. So sick of this app shoving the same 3 adverts down my throat every other post. Also GIFs don't play noise on the official app, cos it's sh1te. The old 3rd party apps were better.",0
The app so bad they had to get rid of all the others out of embarassment,0
The font size and line space is extremely small and no easy to change it!,0

After scrolling through a out 20 posts they just start repeating making the app unusable,0
"Don't know what recently happened, but I can't open the app to save my life without being confronted with ""do you wish to close the app or wait further"" message, this ruins my expectations and my user experience, also, adding the right to left swipe should be a ability to enable or disable in the settings and not something that is forced on me, not a fan of it, not at all. Please update or fix before I delete my account and go touch grass while adulting!",0
App sucks UX-wise,0
worst app people here spread too much negativity,0
Awful UI...muted subreddits still show up. Spezza sucks update 4 20 24 awful update... videos play automatic and it is difficult to stop them while browsing comments,0

This app is full of anti-Christ, progressivist nonsense that will destroy your soul.",0

"I detest the official Reddit app, and killing off 3rd party apps with outrageous API fees isn't going to make me use it. It's going to make me stop using Reddit. I've spent nearly 11 years in the site, but this will be the end of that unless this policy decision is prevented. /u/zxam",0
Pathetic,0
4/19 update: even with this update the biggest issue by far is still the battery consumption. On a new phone this app killed 25% of battery in 1 hour of browsing. Unacceptable. I've done all the adjustments on my end and it makes no difference.,0
Messed it up by removing 3rd party apps. Video doesnt work in chrome.,0
"New update is terrible, so are the API changes.",0
"this dumb app takes forever to load, and i'm not even kidding. it literally takes an enternity. i open the app, and it's stuck on the reddit face logo indefinitely, nothing else happens. i tried to wait as long as possible, waited 40 mins, nothing. cleared data and cache, nothing. reinstalled, nothing. fix your app, reddit.",0

This update is horrible. How can I go back to the good way. I can't even navigate my community.,0
Awful app and they killed all alternatives to force you to use it. I'd rather not use reddit at all than use this app.,0
"Reddit when I first installed it was pretty decent. However now it's full of lag when loading DM's and I never get notified of DM's when ppl message me. I also get random notifications of subreddits I haven't followed nor interacted with, why???? Not to mention the stupid blocking issue, if I'm blocked just load up a screen that says you are blocked, like twitter does, I dunno why they don't do that.",0
"Long loading times, massive lag when trying to open a post comment thread, and high battery usage when using the app. Getting rid of third party apps was a mistake. Please fix your application, as everyone must now use it. Edit: tapping a post randomly catapults you to the top of the feed again without warning, spontaneous logging out of your account when trying to open a post or thread. Images load in the thumbnail and won't load then opening the post in question.",0
It's a good app to connect with communities. I've used it for years with hardly any complaints. Lately they keep making changes to the user interface where it is much less usable and more of an eyesore than ever before. It's beginning to look very unprofessional and elementary. No need to fix what wasn't broken! With the changes in user interface comes SO many bugs and glitches. The app is sometimes unscrollable with the constant errors. The app was fine before..,0
"Seriously how could they make it this bad? Videos always play in full screen. There's no setting to turn that off. The only way to pause is a tiny button in the lower left corner when it's in full screen, but if you tap the comments icon, it moves to the lower right. Even when tapping on a non video post the screen refreshes as if it's trying to go full screen. You can't swipe through postings in the order that you have them displayed, it just shows the next similar one however they define it.",0
"It's pretty slow sometimes. Get a lot of errors. Also, this might not be the app but the site itself... the notifications always show I have one even though I've looked at all of them. Kinda drives me crazy. The site itself is also very addictive and forces you to engage a lot before posting on certain subs. I get that's a way to filter out bots/ trolls, but it means you're likely to get addicted. Not great. No wonder people try to ""karma farm.""",0
"This update is really bad. Most notably in the way swiping through photos in a post has become neverending, taking you to the next post without telling you, and also in how the download feature works now. Rather than quickly pressing download and moving on, downloading is more tedious and the pop-up covers the download button slowing down my ability to download pictures. This is a huge issue for me as I use this app to keep up with a Kpop group I like. Might wind up finding a different platform.",0
"Reddit's own native app almost always has issues loading its own content. I have to actively avoid reloading the home page, because if I do, it shows as 'empty' and refuses to load any. Sometimes entering other's account pages glitches out as well. These two examples aren't the only glitches I experience daily. I am now going to search for an alternative reddit app because of how frustrating and inconvenient the experience is becoming. It is highly recommend that you look elsewhere as well.",0
"After the recent update it is way too easy to accidentally swipe into a new post. Sometimes it happens when i click the comments button, like it thinks my finger made the slightest sideways move when i was really just tapping. Also, Caption text blocks the bottoms of images when open in full screen. Backing out of a post now takes multiple clicks, like more than is normally reasonable.",0
"A frustrating and intrusive necessity. The mobile browser version doesn't give you any real interface for chat messages, rich text editor, many buttons for optional linking/uploading, no flair interface, cannot important subreddit info, et cetera. The desktop layout has them but typing constantly screws up in that layout so it's completely unusable and wastes your time. Way to go, Spez, you made everything so terrible that we have to use your app at least some of the time.",0
"Just about everything about this app is just a worse version of Reddit and all the previous apps. The home page alone is a disaster. Whatever algorithm they are using is beyond useless as the page is full of posts from subs I wasn't looking for, random suggestions, and ads disguised as normal posts. Media frequently fails to work, and it's hilarious how inept the app navigation controls are. I even tried waiting to see if Reddit would eventually care. I guess it's awful by intention.",0
"New update (04/20/24) has made the app virtually unusable. I try to collapse a comment and the thread gets auto's rolled to the top of the post. It auto refreshes when I was reading a post, so then I have to either look for it or not finish it. Very annoyed these issues keep returning with ""bug fix"" updates that just return the bugs.",0
"Overall, the app works fine and does the job well. However, it is riddled with weird bugs. Some posts, and mainly videos, do not load properly, requiring me to clear the cache occasionally. Sometimes, you can hear the audio of videos that are yet to be scrolled by, and they even overlap in certain situations (still faulty after many patches). Finally, it is an optimization mess and very laggy. I'd stick to the website if I could, but there is no proper way to use Reddit on the go.",0
"New post navigation is absolutely worthless. The app can't tell a vertical swipe from a horizontal one, and there is no inertia to the comments section divider, meaning you have to drag it all the way, 3""-4"", down to the bottom of the screen, instead of grabbing it and flicking it down with a gesture, like it used to be. This is bad ux design worthy of being an example in textbooks.",0
"This app works fine until it doesn't. And wow, does it ""doesnt"" often. I am CONSTANTLY having trouble with videos in particular, from not being able to upload videos at all, to videos showing they are fully loaded then get stuck saying ""Upload Pending"" to the progress bar going to the end and then starting comletely over endlessly. Among many other issues. Edit: I wasn't harsh enough; this app is literally terrible and if you're a content person, it is the most frustratingly buggy app ever.",0
"New update is hell. Changed the UI and how it operates. Can't see text for individual photos in a post, just opens the comments if you try. Instead of not being able to swipe after you get to the last photo on a post it takes you to a random post. Changed how the videos are played from scrolling up and down to scrolling left and right, trying to scroll down opens comments. None of these very annoying features are optional.",0
"there are lot of opinions on the Reddit app. this is my opinion on the newest update. it is super annoying when I am looking at a post with multiple pictures, and I get to the end without knowing it is the last picture. then I swipe one more time and it is a totally different post and I didn't even realize it. that's dumb and a mistake to have as a ""feature""",0
"Accessing Reddit through a browser may be better at this point. Tapping something hides a comment, which is a great way to lose your place, while tap and hold brings up a set of share options that covers the majority of the screen. Currently the worst offender in Android is that audio starts playing for posts or videos that are not even on screen. Be ready for a bevy of random voices and sounds while scrolling, some of which seem to continue even after switching apps.",0
"Recent changes to the way the app's UI functions has become extremely infuriating to use. Scrolling and browsing is no longer intuitive and fluid, with constant resets and exits. Also there are so many ads now. Every 3rd post is an ad for something dumb. Since banning 3rd party apps, reposts are constant and you see the same content over and over. Gifs and videos no longer play when clicked, and some don't even play at all. Whoever has been behind these UI changes should reconsider their job.",0
"I think they just like making the app worse over time? The new gestures are dumb. You tap on a picture/post, swipe up for comments, then swipe back..for it to just show the picture/post, swipe back a 2nd time to be back on the post that shows the comments below the picture anyway, then swipe back a 3rd time to go to the main page. Glad they got rid of 3rd party apps so we can experience this god tier UI 😀",0
"It's a decent app but there's a feature that ruins it for me. On Android, if you visit the app through a Google link, then hit back on your device, instead of going back to the search results, the app just takes you back through all the reddit pages you previously had open. This makes browsing Google pages really annoying, I may delete so I can go back to normal web browsing, but they have made that difficult too. Why is there no good way to do this?",0
The removal of the ability to sort posts on the home page makes the app much harder to navigate through my content. And not the ability to change this in settings has also been removed. It is not possible to click on cross posts with a video as the video plays in the new player instead of going to the original post. Ads also look identical to posts and don't clearly standout from user posted content. Swipe from the bottom actions for back don't work with the new message swipe action.,0
"App sucks. No way to change font size without changing it on your phone. Half the time when I collapse a comment it scrolls all the way to the top of the post. That and other minor bugs. Just a pain compared to the other third party apps they basically shut down. I mostly use other types of social media now. It's mostly due to the app not working right. Also, the big problem with racism on their site.",0
"Installed app as I was sick of being prompted in browser. MISTAKE! While I'm enjoying the subreddits & photos, it's a nightmare weeding through my feed since 90% are unrelated to my interests. Also annoying is the inability to post photos without trying 7 or 8 times. The photo changes to an asterisk with or without a caption, and whether I put the photo 1st or after. I've seen complaints about this in the app, but apparently devs don't care. Pathetic since it had potential. 👎😠",0
"Please stop trying to update the app to make it more ""cool and futuristic/ cutting edge"" every single time it back fires and a bunch of things that worked just fine go haywire. Just go back like you all did last time, this update sucks. The gestures don't help, and only cut off information that I was once able to see but now literally can not access no matter what I do now.",0
"The frequency of lost content is difficult to tolerate. I was writing a verbose comment and switched apps on my phone to copy/paste a URL into my comment and, when I went back to Reddit, it had deleted my comment and put me back on the home screen. It could have been because of an app update, but it goes to emphasize that our content is not prioritized. If I'm writing an email or a note in other apps, it's saving the state automatically as I type, which also makes it resilient. Not Reddit.",0
"The Reddit app struggles to function at a fundamental level far too often. It's one thing if you're just using it for browsing and recreation, it's another if you're attempting to use Reddit as a way of promoting a business. Features will stop working, or the app will crash entirely. The web app is very little help as well. Some basic features just don't exist on the web app, which forces you to limp through the mobile app, hoping it's in the mood to work.",0
"While it technically works, it's never as good as the long gone free 3rd party reddit experiences. It's also buggy and not well optimized. Be careful if you look at a post in a community you're not interested in - you may be stuck with notifications to that subreddit going forward, even if you indicate you're not interested from within the app. If you're on a folding phone, you're not going to have a great time since neither view is optimized and the app remembers each screen separately.",0
"Garbage app, has a memory leak that makes it crash after scrolling, if you can even do that much, because it randomly stops letting you swipe to the next post and you have to start from the top and then manually find where it no longer lets you swipe. Thanks for killing third party apps, and not fixing this garbage dump of an app. Very cool.",0
"There's a bug where it will auto play an advertisement's audio when you click on another thread above or below the ad. Can't turn off the audio and makes more a really annoying experience. Update: 4 months later, the problems listed above persists. Additionally the audio has now started playing when I close the reddit app and even when my phone is locked unless I force close out of the app, so that's cool.",0
"This app is functional. It boots. You can post. However it's just painful to use compared to the other apps that where available. It's a major step back in functionality and it's extremely annoying. You can't quote, copy and paste easily, or add links easily. Since reddit made the choice to force everyone to use this app the site quality has declined severely. I don't see a lot of content that I am interested and have no option to easily get updates of that content.",0
"A generally worse user experience than the apps it was meant to replace. The design of this app is obviously pushing for an engagement loop more similar to Instagram or Twitter, rather than the forum structure that Reddit should be. There are tons of amazing features in the 3rd party apps that are missing here. There lots of seriously irritating bugs. I'm giving it 2 stars because it generally works, but does so in a totally inferior manner to the 3rd party apps this replaced. Disappointing.",0
"Fairly unusable now. Can't share links to anyone as you'll end up in an endless loop of trying to open the app, won't even let you view links in a browser anymore. Videos from other posts play even if I've clicked onto a completely different one and thay video is nowhere in my tab, which is weird on many levels. Gotta pop in and out of a post like 6 times to get it to load comments sometimes. RARELY does it ever work correctly.",0
Terrible UI design. Have to maximize video to pause it. Double tap and swipes don't result in the same actions in the different parts of the app. This is th3 only app that makes me feel like I am an 80 y.o. just recently introduced to tech. I keep swiping and tapping and it doesn't do what i want it to do.,0
"Atrocious experience half the time. I've got a powerful device and 1gb internet yet sometimes it's an act of congress to load a photo or video. Ads often play in the background of a post I'm trying to read and can't be muted, I can only back out of the post to stop it. Also why update the app where I can scroll up to go to the next post instead of sideways?? I'm trying to view mutliple pictures on a post not switch to a new post. The amount of recommended subs is SUFFOCATING. Be better reddit.",0
"The app is not good. It is often buggy, where I try to open a post and it will get hung up on a white page and no sequential posts will open after backing out and trying different posts. This happens with image, video, and even text posts, so it's not like a linked website is causing the issue. Also, the app adds zero functionality that isn't already present in the mobile site, and is quite a bit slower than the mobile site.",0
"When it works, it's a nice app. Good layout, makes browsing the site easy, etc. The problem is every single update breaks it in some way, and it doesn't get fixed for several months, and then the new version will be great for two weeks before a new update breaks it again. Most recently, it magically lost the ability to refresh pages. I've thrown in the towel and made the switch to non-official Reddit apps and don't regret it.",0
"The app is barely functional, but functional for what it intends to do. Videos are hit or miss, but my main gripe is the frequency and quality of ads. Not only are ads injected between every few actual posts, but they also look very similar to posts. The cherry on top of this mess is that the quality of the ads is bottom of the barrel. Fast food, alcohol, dubious weight loss, even religious advertising. And you can barely pass your finger along the screen once without hitting another ad.",0
"The app has several shortcomings, such as in an inability to play sound on many videos which have sound in-browser, many of which can be solved by switching to other reddit apps, many of which tend to be smaller than the bloated carcass of an app that they try to force you to use, by locking your account for logging in with any other reddit browsing app. I only give it 2 stars because it, at the bare minimum, does manage to drunkenly stagger it's way to the app's goal; browsing reddit.",0
"Bad and messy. No way to save drafts yet the app crashes in the middle of writing posts or comments all the time. Videos won't play, reloard, or will be very low resolution. It's slow, it won't load half the time or takes way too long despite every other app on my phone working just fine. I feel like the app breaks itself every other update. Sometimes it's fine, and then an update comes and it breaks again and the an update fixes something but that just breaks something else. Overall it's ok.",0
"Long time user of RIF, here. Just bit the bullet and installed this app, and it's genuinely a bad experience. The ads are large, intrusive, and annoying. The interface for basically every interaction is clunky. The moderation tools are terrible and feel like an afterthought. I'm gonna try using it for a day to give it its due, but only because I'm hesitant to just give up on Reddit as a platform, not because there's any pleasure to be had in using this awful app. Two stars since it ""works.""",0
"Takes forever to load with multiple attempts most of the time. Any posts with pictures or gifs or videos take way too long to load. Text posts will usually load fairly quickly, but not with any of the comments, which is half the fun. I have to try refreshing several times but it's never guaranteed, so I end up frustrated and just close the app. Great content, really, if you can access it. But I ended up deleting it due to how ANNOYING it is.",0
"The app is bugged and laggy. A lot of times posts or comments won't load, even though I have service and they load in the browser. The browser version, however, will annoy you with ""download the app"" unless you're browsing in desktop mode, which is a pretty bad experience on a smartphone. Would not recommend, until they fix all their issues.",0
"What's up with the pages not wanting to load, or it'll load the media but not the comments?? It's also been force closing on me alot or going back to an old post I looked at earlier that day if I switch apps/answer calls. Also, if I'm in the middle of a post & get a call/answer a text... more times than not, my progress on the post will disappear. Most times, I have to copy what I was typing beforehand just in case it does. It's very frustrating. Was 5 stars. Changed to 2 til it's fixed.",0
"This is an OK app for me but there needs to be a little more adjustments. Whenever I start opening the app, it just shows the logo and no matter how much times I refresh it or clear the cache, it's still behaving the same way. And that would give me no choice but to delete the app on my phone. Until there's a solution to put an end to the long waiting and staring at the logo, I won't be downloading this back for a little while. I'll go on to the PC site instead :-( 😫",0
"Do the developers have ADHD or something? Seems like the UI changes every week. Things get moved around, things disappear. It's frustrating and a poor experience. Maybe they're just A/B/C/D/E testing or something. Aside from the constant ui changes and videos not working, you also can't swipe left to see more about a subreddit anymore -- have to click the menu option and select the option to see more. Genius UX move. That's sarcasm. Elementary UX designers.",0
"Strict downgrade from apps that worked well like ""Reddit is Fun"". The UI doesn't make sense & doesn't even match the options on the website itself. There's some nice ideas like media scrolling. But it insists on inserting media from random places, rather than where you started. I could maybe see if those random places were subs you subscribed to, but they seem random. Then images don't do the same thing at all. Click a pic and swipe up? It just exits. Give us back the better apps you killed",0
"I don't like how you can't sort within someone's profile post, it's stays on hot posts. The iPad maps always has the sort function available. Also, the fact that there is no sound within most videos is EXTREMELY annoying and the point of the app. I want to see AND hear a video. In order to do so, I have to use reddit in a browser....at that point why use the app????",0
"I like the ease of scrolling. The communities are pretty awesome. A lot more porn than expected, definitely do not recommend for kids. The video or gif viewing is broken. About every 4th or 5th (sometimes 3rd) will cause the video player to freeze or not load. After scrolling for a minute, sometimes the pictures do not load. The ads are also not relevant to my needs or taste. I have issues when scrolling and accidently clicking on one. Also, they got rid of the free awards.",0
"I was fine with seeing normal ads, but recently they've slowly become more and more intrusive. It started with ad videos auto-playing, then automatically turning on audio and now onto a chance of seeing said intrusive ads under the content of a focused submission taking up more screen real-estate in the process. It's made my experience worse and inconvenient having to turn down my volume to avoid loud ads then turning up the volume to hear the content I want to look at.",0
"The mobile browser experience is superior to the app. The app does not load the linked to post when you click through on an email link, doesn't load new messages in chat consistently, and has refresh issues on posts that cause you to see inaccurate up/down votes and sometimes not see replies either. There's just no reason to download it.",0
"Too many ads, poor optimization, and so many weird decisions for updates. Half of the time I try to click a link, it instead collapses the comment thread. Sometimes post images just don't load and I don't realize there's an image with the post until I've read some of the comments talking about an image. Videos that auto start while scrolling through a subreddit just because I started watching it at some point, even when I paused it in the post itself is obnoxious. Not recommended.",0
"Video player doesn't work almost half the time, have to use workarounds. When viewing content, the app will sometimes randomly scroll back to the top when returning to the feed with no option to resume where you were. As of today, July 2nd, my ""Sort By"" options are gone. UI is far from optimized for an app this widely-used. No wonder so many people use third party mobile apps.",0
"Annoying ads all the time that has nothing to do with me. Crashes every couple of days as well. I prefer browsing Reddit on my PC, but sometimes I need to use it mobile. Changing the icon doesn't look as great & is shoving political bs in my face when I'm trying to avoid it. Do like the ability to browse various subs on the go however.",0
"Something isn't right... I had Reddit on another tablet which recently died. The installation today is off.. where when you scroll, there is a photo coming up, but when you get to the photo it goes blank. When you pass the photo,you can see that it reappears. Odd. Many of the videos do not play at all. It would be nice to have preferences of NOT seeing specific things like bugs & spiders.",0
"This app has done nothing to improve its usability since I have been using it. With no option to sort by hour, I have been shown the same posts that hit the page yesterday. The video player is sub par, and does not even play half of the videos, even when they are hosted on Reddit themselves. There seems to be a new glitch where audio from an adjacent post will all of a sudden start playing for no reason. There are more ads that look like posts, than posts themselves. Overall this app is garbage.",0
"I personally hate the UI change that was made about a month or so ago, in which they adopted the Tiktok-style media player. The whole app just feels so much more clunky and painful to use since then. I thought I might adapt to it given enough time, but no. It's just terrible. Rearranging where several components were and having to press back multiple times to leave a post were surprisingly annoying changes.",0
"It regularly crashes for no reason. I'm just looking at text posts, how on earth is that causing it to crash?? Also, if you try to view a user's comment that's in a thread under a downvoted comment then it's impossible to view because you have to tap a very small area to expand it and it's right underneath the phone's navigation buttons. So it doesn't register trying to tap in that area. It also regularly has issues saving posts and comments for no reason. Plus you can't claim your free reward.",0
"This is the only social media app that REQUIRES extremely, almost perfect, good connection. You got LTE speed with 4 bars instead of 5? Oh well, I guess you won't be able to read that comment someone posted. The app is trash. It doesn't load most of the time, and when it does, it doesn't update the UI. You can have 50 comments on your post and the app will still show only 3. It has been like this for year. They don't care. But the damn advertisements always load fast...",0
"It's mostly ok, but offers less functionality than the iOS app. Videos don't always play, whether from the home screen or once you tap on them. A solution to this seems to be to restart the app. But the app keeps track of what you already ""viewed,"" so in an effort to show you new things, it removes the video from your home screen that you restarted the app to view. Apps have bugs, but this is one of the biggest social media companies and the problem has been going on for at least a year.",0
"The recent changes have made this app unusable. Constant crashing, ridiculous load times, sometimes things never load. Ad titles can be as long as they want to, but now I have to manually click on the post to see its entirety, which is almost promised to loaf slow. Can't see usernames anymore without clicking on the posts. Even then, hit detection seems abismal, even for accessing the slider bar on videos, to which I'll also have to immediately go to unmute it since it mutes itself everytime.",0
"Extremely disappointed with recent changes to the app. Sorting has been completely removed from the Home screen, and the new Latest screen which I would have switched to does not have view settings. Replies to comments no longer have any context showing, and if a post has any amount of traffic, the View All option is completely useless. I have been growing more and more dissatisfied with this app, and today I have finally given up and uninstalled it.",0
"Some things I'd like to see changed for solid quality of life improvements. Move the ""save"" button to under the posts where the upvote and comment buttons are, it's so much quicker and less prone to misclick from touchy options. Second, let me choose where reddit downloads images on my phone. I have a dedicated meme folder in my gallery, but reddit only ever goes to ""downloads"" and I hate taking time to move everything.",0
"When I hear audio, it's not for the thing I'm looking at. It's easy to use and the ads are unobtrusive, but there's always some technical issue or another with each version that makes using it impractical, but the web experience is punishing because it aggressively pushes the app. The platform itself is fine, but it's social media, it's difficult to moderate well, and the most vocal people tend to be garbage anyway. I'm better off not indulging in this experience no matter how you slice it.",0
"So many bugs. The amount of times I have to restart the app to stop a video playing in the background that I can't see or stop is ridiculous. And occasionally I can't put my screen in landscape mode, which occurs only in the reddit app. Seems like the people behind the scenes are amateurs who can't solve small problems that other media platforms have fixed years ago.",0
"Convenient, yet buggy. Videos will often not play and gifs are frozen. A lot of loading issues as well. These have been persistent issues for me across multiple mobile devices. When I go through a post to look at comments the ability to scroll down also has issues. There have also been the issue of videos that were playing sounds when you refresh will continue to do it until the app is closed or the video stops.",0
"Not the worst, but could be much better, since there are still some incredibly annoying issues: not being able to update your user flair, the new image/video player format which makes it impossible to see the post flair (unless there are multiple pictures for some reason), not being able to see all of the posts you've hidden, and being laggy for seemingly no reason. Overall rather disappointed, but it's (in my opinion) still better than the mobile website, so I'll be patient.",0
"Reddit is a great platform, itself. There's literally almost a subreddit for anything you can think of. However the app itself is full of bugs and errors. My main issue is I've never been able to upload an image post from the app (but there are countless other bugs and errors as well). Hopefully someday soon the app will be up to par to the standards of a website as successful as reddit.",0
"Just when I thought the video player couldn't possibly get any worse, the developers apparently went out of their way to discover a whole new dimension of unusable garbage. 50% of the time it literally won't work at all, and if it does function, the UI fights you tooth and nail. You can't just read comments on a link without the video playing in the background, the pause/play button is unresponsive, audio is messed up, etc. Please, for the love of God, make the video player somewhat usable.",0
"This app has gotten worse over time. Browsing has degraded, it often reverts from my last page view, deletes history, or simply errors out. Yes you can use it, but be ready for them to beg for money, harass you for taking screenshots, put pop-over notifications up, and try to ""promote"" ads as content and in your recommendations. It's not unusable, just badly degraded, clunky and unreliable.",0
"Coming off of Reddit is Fun and I figured it wouldn't be that bad, I'll just switch to the Reddit App. Wow. I don't know what else to say, this has to be one of the worst apps I've used. The ads really aren't even the problem, they're slightly intrusive but the real problems are under the surface. The video player and user interface for it are both just pure evil.",0
"The Reddit app - which you're forced to use instead of a mobile webpage - is fraught with bugs and ill-advised updates. For example, this update added a TikTok inspired video scroll feature that was likely not begged for. The app has also been plagued with connectivity and stability issues in the years I've used it. Things don't load, there are unexpected errors, and I know for a fact it isn't my personal network setup. Please, Reddit. Less is more, especially for such a unique platform.",0
"UI is clean and easy to navigate, but there are too many problems to make the app worth using. Ads will autoplay audio in comment threads, frequent problems refreshing the site, and videos load in awful quality, without sound, or both. Other alternative apps are far superior and allow blocking of uninteresting subreddits and complete removal of ads, among other helpful features",0
"I had put up with the app for a number of years despite numerous small, irreversible changes that made the user experience worse (moving the upvote button from one side to another, adding huge icons in the center of the screen to advertise streams, etc), but the final straw for me was when they updated the video player and made it completely unusable. This app is in a continual state of decline.",0
"Every time the app updates, I feel like I lose a feature. Most recently, they updated how videos, gifs, and photos are shown. Adding reddits UI over the content. Not only does it look worse, I've noticed posts load slower, if at all. Reddit live continues to show up in your feed constantly, despite hiding. There's also been a small issue when viewing a profile, you are not able to change the sorting of their posts from new. I was able to perform this function on the iPhone version of the app.",0
"Worst app I've used in a very long time. Awful, unintuitive, unrespnsive, and ugly. Lags and bugs constantly. Doesn't display info you want. Dedicates way too much screenspace on bloat and useless filler. Just straight up terrible. The Reddit website used to have such a clean, elegant UI. Now, they managed to screw up the app in ways I didn't even know were possible.",0
"Want to view the content you're subscribe to? Too bad! Here's a stream, an ad, a suggested post, ONE sub you're actually subscribed to, and then another ad. I'd say use the mobile site instead, but I'm almost certain they sabotaged it to make people migrate to the app. In all honesty, use the mobile site and use the ""desktop version"" if you can, it's the most bearable version.",0
"The app got worse. Features keep disappearing, the video player refuses to play videos, and the one tap controls everything in a thread. They added a read-only portion for posts for a week, then took it away. Trending topics is gone now, too. One tap is all it takes to show a spoiler, but it's going to close the comment it's in. The same goes for links in a comment, too. It seems the app keeps changing for the sake of change, and it's annoying.",0
"The app could be ok, but the video player is terrible, and they will randomly downgrade your experience as an ""experiment"" without giving you the choice to opt out. Most recently they removed some users' ability to sort their feed, which is a feature available in every other version of Reddit. Don't bother with this app; the unofficial versions or website are both better choices.",0
"It has been two years of the native video player NOT WORKING. Half the time videos don't play and just play a black screen, or the video just freezes out right. If you click the link to view the video on the website, it just gives you a ""watch on app"" overlay that still won't let you watch the goddamn content. Ridiculous that the video player still doesn't work consistently.",0
"Normally I really enjoy using this app, but since the last update it is impossible to browse properly. I like having the ability to continually scroll down until I get bored of what I'm seeing, but with the update I can no longer do that. It refreshes itself constantly and I lose my place and have to look at all the same bs again. Lots of videos and images aren't loading... full of bugs!",0
"(EDIT: Took off a star because the app is still freezing and crashing several months later.) Reddit is a great platform, but the app is glitchy. It will often freeze, leaving just a white screen, and I'll have to restart the app. That's annoying. However, when it works, I do find it easy to use and tend not to miss the desktop version. I just wish it was more stable and also had a rich text editor so I don't have to remember how many asterisks I need to italicize a word.",0
"Wish we could block certain ads and be given different ads. Very annoying. Newest update makes content almost uneditable. Sometimes when you go back to fix something and then back, the curser will show as being at your most recent spot. However when you type it will send you back up to the spot you just tried to edit and deletes the word you type there. Very frustrating while posting.",0
"How did they manage to make the video player *worse*? Horrible change to the UI, and half the videos don't play. Edit: lowered rating to 2 stars because video player is truly awful. If I am watching a video, pause it, and then go to comments, the video starts playing again while reading comments. Videos from ""popular"" will play while being in ""home"" and viceversa. It's not just inconvenience, it eats up bandwidth like nothing else.",0
"The app is clunky, it crashes occasionally, the videos are hit or miss if they will load, too many ads in the feed (an I should be able to comment on the ads), but the biggest problem is the fact that they could easily fix any of it but choose not to. When r/place was up, they were updating a pixel map in real time as millions of users all over the globe placed single pixels on a huge picture, and yet they can't make a video load? Ridiculous. All in all, the service is great but clunky on mobile",0
"I like its interface the most between this or Redditisfun, so I've tried to stick with it. Unfortunately it's always had an issue for me where it won't play a video and I have to restart the app and find the video again, and always had a tendency to just crash altogether. The past couple weeks it's crashing multiple times per day.",0
"Reddit is great, the app is worthless. Videos only play for a couple seconds and then go black, I can still hear the video playing, but no video. Pics will sometimes load, sometimes they don't. When I back out of a post it sometimes sends me back to top of my feed. All of this is completely random as to when it occurs. Save yourself some frustration and avoid the useless app and just go to the website instead.",0
"There are many excellent communities that have great discussions here. However, the app has so many bugs it can be tiresome to use. It crashes very frequently and it often just shows a white screen and I have to restart it. It's really annoying when you scrolled far down in your feed and then it just crashes all of a sudden. And you're back to the top when you restart it.",0
"Access to Reddit is nice, UI is intuitive, but the app itself is pretty bad. It crashes often (I'm on a Pixel 3), the search function might as well be non-existent (this may be a general Reddit problem, but still), and everything takes a very long time to load. This is on gigabit internet with very fast WiFi. In public places where reception isn't absolutely perfect but access to my mobile network is still good enough for basically every other function on the internet, this app won't work.",0
"Can we just go back to the old video player? The new one has many flaws. It auto plays when you drag the slider, makes it difficult to see post info such as when it was posted, it flat out doesn't play sometimes, doesn't use swipe gestures to exit (goes to some random video instead), doesn't have the same share icon as the rest of the app, makes for a significantly worse experience looking at comments, and makes the back button first go comments to video and then video to refresh. I could go on",0
"Occasionally text from the headlines run right into the thumbnail image and become un readable. When I have 3 bars of reception nothing loads at all, apart from ads, yet I can load everything via my web browser just fine. The comments are cut short to give recommendations. If you hide the first comment you are forced to click ""show more comments"". But instead of showing the next comment, it shows responses to the hidden one. You have unhide and re hide to navigate properly. Every time.",0
"The app will run in the background even when background permissions are disabled, taking up to 1 GB of RAM and killing other apps that should be open. Half of the time it won't load comments. The video player is often glitchy. You can't permalink with the app. It's generally much laggier than it should be, considering it's just a bunch of text and buttons.",0
"Each update seems to make this app less useful. The app is significantly slower loading and lags. The issue of videos auto playing in a thread, even with that feature turned off is still there. I don't want to see when someone is typing in a thread or real-time upvotes of threads. That's just useless clutter slowing the app down. It's something that should have an option to be turn off in the settings menu.",0
"For an app as heavily funded as Reddit, it's mind blowing unstable. It freezes constantly, there's weird behavior everywhere, connection issues with the server, and the video playback is horrendous. Half the time there's a ghost video playing in the background that i can't mute or pause because i can't find it. I enjoy Reddit when it's working, but that's not often.",0
"I have never experienced a more unreliable app than this one. I'm lucky if i can use it for 10 minutes before something either freezes, stops loading, or a message appears that Reddit stopped working...I have to close out of it completely and restart it. I have sent error report after error report with endless descriptions and it just never stops crashing. I honestly use it on the mobile website more often than not now.",0
"The app has gone downhill fast. Even before the new video change, they would get stuck and require restarting the app to work. Now they just arbitrarily break. They also force themselves into full view mode. You also have to explicitly open it into full view to mute or pause it if scrolling through your feed or popular. It makes it a pain to check any video now. Would rather open a link to YouTube at this point.",0
"Congratulations, you've managed to ruin the simplest app ever. The app crashes the moment I open it, and even if it doesn't crash, the rest of reddit is just as bad. The UI is complicated, corrupt mods ruin the subreddits, and the video player doesn't work. You should stop updating this and rebuild the app from scratch. It would take less time and yield better results.",0
"Its constantly buggy and its been especially slow and unresponsive the past month. Frequently having problems where videos won't load unless you close the app or open in browser(where they try to force you back into the app, probably so you're forced to see ads that load without problem) The search function is probably the worst thing I've seen, constantly bringing up completely irrelevant things and ignoring results that actually have the search in the title. At least give some filter options",0
"I like the native abilities the app has, but, it needs a ton of refinement. I don't like that you cannot customize the tree view. I primarily use Sync and with that I can customize a lot. Dync does not instantly notify me of comments/etc though, like this offical app does. A giant issue is that the low bandwidth or low signal ""something went wrong"" errors are plentiful! If I open Sync, ya it may occasionally not connect, but, I just have to refresh and I'm good to go.",0
"Reddit for the last few years for me has been more than just an app. It's how I fill most of my time spent on my phone for entertainment. Not only have I learned a great deal of information from the people on it, but on a daily basis, I have new content to explore that thanks to my subscribed 'subreddit's, is almost always within my own interests. Update: changed from 5 to 2 stars because after watching a few videos, videos won't play at all. It's become infuriating.",0
Very glitchy and overall annoying. It works for the most part but it takes forever to load some posts and often fails to load sound or images. The comments will often fail to load or glitch and require a reload of the app. The videos will occasionally fail to load and will show a static image. Many posts will not open when clicked on and the app will sometimes crash when you try to open a post. When opening the app it will often open into a random post and won't take you back to the main page,0
"The people/communities are the only good thing about this app. It's buggy, and half of the time the pictures don't load. I honestly would delete if it weren't for the people here. And as of late it's been glitchier than ever. Also, if someone has a vision disability, it's practically impossible to use this app without an API, that they can't access anymore.",0
"Sometimes videos will show a peek, but then go completely black, but the sound still plays. I could get over that, but now when scrolling, the video and sound from the next post plays too early. If even so much as a sliver of the next post is on the screen, that video starts playing with sound over the sound of the video I'm actually trying to see. And to top it off, when I switch to another app, the sound from reddit continues for a few seconds even though the app is minimized.",0
"It works. Not great. Not unusable. But it doesn't really matter now since this app is it if you want Reddit. It's this app or nothing. Not the way it should be, but the way it is.",0
New update killed it. The weird sipping while in posts is odd. Used to scrolling down for now content now it just opens up comments. It was fine before the change. What should've changed though is how easy it is to slide over to the popular side when trying to swipe to change the picture. Fix your app,0
Normally it's pretty good but with this recent update I can't ignore message requests without them going right to my inbox instead. So having to block people just to get rid of the message requests and it's really annoying,0
Its great but sometimes I face a problems accessing some reddit posts or account don't know the reason. Maybe it is deleted thats why something like that but reddit just doesn't give a clear reason why some things are not loading.,0
"literally have only used it for a day. the next day i tried to open it, it wouldn't even load the homepage. i thought it was my connection at first, but i tried checking with other apps and my internet is completely fine. i can only assume it's the app itself.",0
You cant comment or look at comments anymore,0
"New update (04/20/24) has made the app virtually unusable. I try to collapse a comment and the thread gets auto's rolled to the top of the post. It auto refreshes when I was reading a post, so then I have to either look for it or not finish it. Very annoyed these issues keep returning with ""bug fix"" updates that just return the bugs.",0
Why is there no landscape mode for tablets?,0
"Can't scroll through photo sets. It's been like this for a while, and it's infuriating",0
Too much buffering & loading need to work on it,0
Extremely glitchy on android.,0
Why can't I open anymore i try the website and it still won't open,0
"5☆ to 2☆ I Loved this app, Love the girls, love posting my art here but for reasons unknown I got banded for life month or two ago. I did nothing to deserve a life time band or punishment at all. I tried to fight it but got instantly denied. Pretty lame Reddit!",0
"Chats are slow and glitches entirely too much. Still, a lot of bugs needing fixed.",0
"Seriously how could they make it this bad? Videos always play in full screen. There's no setting to turn that off. The only way to pause is a tiny button in the lower left corner when it's in full screen, but if you tap the comments icon, it moves to the lower right. Even when tapping on a non video post the screen refreshes as if it's trying to go full screen. You can't swipe through postings in the order that you have them displayed, it just shows the next similar one however they define it.",0
At this point what isn't wrong with the app,0
"Besides overlords censoring content and making and enforcing arbitrary rules, and besides the app being completely buggy and inaccessable 1 to 2 days out of the week. Besides those 2 things this app is incredible. But only because of the people that contribute to the platform. IE. The people and the users themselves. Management and the way the app is run itself is absolute garbage.",0
Barely works. More often then not it fails to load anything.,0
Getting the app to work is a mission Update: What's the point of having an app that barely works,0
There should be the option to change the speed of videos. Custom feeds regularly just refuse to load.,0
Gone down hill... Too many power crazy mods. Too many stupid restrictions. It isn't the community like it used to be,0
Started to get serious issues since now cos it wont load anything at all. And every other game and app works fine. Reddit went downhill fast.,0
"It's pretty slow sometimes. Get a lot of errors. Also, this might not be the app but the site itself... the notifications always show I have one even though I've looked at all of them. Kinda drives me crazy. The site itself is also very addictive and forces you to engage a lot before posting on certain subs. I get that's a way to filter out bots/ trolls, but it means you're likely to get addicted. Not great. No wonder people try to ""karma farm.""",0
Edited my review because the app is trash now. I keep getting an error on my phone when looking at various threads and the options that show up when you click on the three dots don't show up.,0
I used to use Reddit a lot until the recent update. Now the app won't even load fully and I can't see messages or notifications in the app.,0
"Overall horrible experience. Posts fail to load, videos incapable of loading properly, 'oops something went wrong!' every other navigation through the app. absolutely terrible.",0
Old reddit is down. New reddit forces me to use the app to view subreddits.,0
"Reddit used to be the best place on the internet. Now it's trash. X is in the gutter, Bluesky is ... hokey? Facebook needs no explanation. I'm putting my phone down and going outside to feel like a decent human again.",0
"A terrible experience. RiF worked so well. Using this app is torture. It's not very responsive at all. Moving from a lost back to a sub is clunky. The ""machine learning"" homepage is a mess. I just want to see posts that are hot from the subs I follow, but instead it's mostly new or low voted content. There are far too many promoted ad posts and they blend in too much with actual posts. If third party apps could get this right, you have no excuse not to be better.",0
Used to love the app then they changed the UI. F****** app doesn't even feel right anymore Edit: ever since I updated past the most recent UI change I have not do uninstall and reinstall the app like four times because the app just stopped working correctly couldn't open any posts or anything.,0
Buggeddddd,0
The most broken way to browse a website I have ever experienced.,0
"Bad. Just bad. The new Swipe gestures simply suck. They interfere with Google navigation gestures. Also, not sure why they thought that showing hyperlinks just like they do in Xitter is a good idea. A huge downgrade.",0
"This app was okay-ish before the update but it's absolutely trash after it. The gestures are confusing and I can't make new posts to subreddits I've been to before. Reddit, please revert most of this update",0
"Downgraded to 2☆, has big issues when swiping on posts with multiple photos. Instead of showing the next photo, 75% of the time it goes to the ""popular"" section instead. Boo.",0
"The only thing good about this app is the forum and nothing else. The data display is unreliable ( comments and votes are inconsistent, different number in what you see on browser). It is always loading with no apparent reason (you need to close the app to try load the page again) plus you can see the re***arded smilling loading icon while you struggle loading their page the icon is smilling like it is enjoying it(whoever make and approve this design is an amateur). All the avatar is disgusting.",0
Constant warnings... despite repeatedly confirming that I'm over 18...I get warning after warning that certain content is not suitable for a work environment...I've updated the settings etc but still get these annoying warning messages constantly,0
Spez is an Ohio rizzler and baby Gronk (skibidi Sigma) is no match for his fanum tax. Kevin and Lilly Dun are shipping Spez who is goated and prohibits edging.,0
"It's way too buggy. It works at times but not like the old 3rd party apps i.e., rif.",0
Half the links I click on won't open thru the app via my Yahoo Mail app. & even then half of those are deleted by the time I go to read em!,0
"Have the developers ever fully test these new gestures before releasing it? It feels so unintuitive. For posts with multiple pictures attached, why can you overswipe left and jump to the next post??? Also, Tap a picture then swipe up to show comments. Great. Tapping back will go back to the picture. Sure. Tapping back again will go back to the post... which will also shows the comments... like what??? Come on... did the developers seriously tested this and go ""yeap, this is a great idea""???",0
Making posts is a nightmare. How/who deletes my posts?? The reasons are not made clear! But there is some good NSFW content 😏,0
"Fix the mobile login problem always say's ""we're not able to authenticate you""",0
i still can't believe there isn't landscape mode on tablets. I use in landscape almost all the time and it's impossible to view making it virtually pointless. The app on phones and in portrait orientation on tablets works well enough.,0
"When you confront homophobic people, you receive a warning from Reddit. Your opinion is not welcome if it's not mainstream and homophobic.",0
The removal of the ability to sort posts on the home page makes the app much harder to navigate through my content. And not the ability to change this in settings has also been removed. It is not possible to click on cross posts with a video as the video plays in the new player instead of going to the original post. Ads also look identical to posts and don't clearly standout from user posted content. Swipe from the bottom actions for back don't work with the new message swipe action.,0
What's the point of the app when stuff loads 10 times faster on a web browser ? It makes me really mad sometimes I don't get it,0
Not optimised for foldable devices.,0
Yeah it seems to become worse with every update. Removing awards was not a smart move. But still love my communities here,0
"First time use - inbox is terrible If you ignore chats they instead audio accept, can't remove them from inbox after can only block to remove from inbox. A little bit ago when I first downloaded it, it was fine so not sure what's up. I'm newer to reddit so not sure if it's suppose to be this... Broken",0
"This update is really bad. Most notably in the way swiping through photos in a post has become neverending, taking you to the next post without telling you, and also in how the download feature works now. Rather than quickly pressing download and moving on, downloading is more tedious and the pop-up covers the download button slowing down my ability to download pictures. This is a huge issue for me as I use this app to keep up with a Kpop group I like. Might wind up finding a different platform.",0
The recent updates sucks. Why I have to tap that tiny square at the right corner again to view pictures or video? Previously was okay perfect.,0
"Terrible video player, hardly get sound on anything. 3rd party apps were far better.",0
"Bad UX, mostly dark patterns trying to fake engagement via a bad user interface",0
"Would be better if you could report accounts. Someone from my real life made an account specifically to target me anonymously, and I can't do anything if they make more accounts to look at what I post.",0
Cant used gramarly,0
Nothing loads.,0
Most people i get answers from aren't nice.,0
"I installed it this years ago but hated it. Uninstalled. Was linked back and saw 4 outta 5 stars, and I thought it got better. I'm scrolling down over 100 reviews and only one 4 star. Mostly only 1 and 2 stars. It appears to be a horrible app like I recalled but way worse and not a single response from developers. That's ALWAYS a Red Flag for me. Now only 2.6! Overall, it's a disappointing app with no excuse to be so unevolved. If anything, it has devolved considerably, and the reviews prove it.",0
"Recent changes to app have made it worse, like changes to how sort options are managed being less user friendly, changing posts with multiple pictures to continue into another post, and something that's outright stopping me from being able to keep browsing by swiping to the left after a certain number of posts, even when there are more",0
Using on a tablet is a chore. Due to the lack of landscape mode.,0
I've seen this app all over my tiktok fyp but when i tried to make an account for some reason i couldn't make one even though the user name i chosed wasnt in used it kept loading i tried to use another user and yet still loading im not sure if this is a bug or some people is also like this:'D Please try to fix it 🙏,0
"MY ADVICE TOO THIS APP: THEN YOU HITTING THE SAVE ICON TO SAVE A POST, YOU WILL ALSO HIT THE HIDE BUTTON BY ACCIDENT TOO EASY, YOU SHOULD MOVE IT DOWN OR MAKE A NEW BIGGER BETTER MENY ICONS, HIDDEN BECOME VERY HIDDEN, I CANNOT FIND THE POST EVER AGAIN, FIX THAT, ALSO THE APP IS SLOW AS F...",0
"After the recent update it is way too easy to accidentally swipe into a new post. Sometimes it happens when i click the comments button, like it thinks my finger made the slightest sideways move when i was really just tapping. Also, Caption text blocks the bottoms of images when open in full screen. Backing out of a post now takes multiple clicks, like more than is normally reasonable.",0
"UI got messed up somehow. Viewing posts with images and a caption has become oddly tedious? It's worded like this was an intentional change, but it just feels like a weird bug.",0
The more I use it the more annoying it gets.,0
Pretty slow loading times and it doesn't even verify age for nsfw things. Also most of the videos have no sound.,0
"For the past week, every time I press ignore on a chat request, it accepts the chat. I then have to block the person in order to get rid of the chat because hiding doesn't work now. These updates aren't fixing anything.",0
for no reason it crash,0
"I think they just like making the app worse over time? The new gestures are dumb. You tap on a picture/post, swipe up for comments, then swipe back..for it to just show the picture/post, swipe back a 2nd time to be back on the post that shows the comments below the picture anyway, then swipe back a 3rd time to go to the main page. Glad they got rid of 3rd party apps so we can experience this god tier UI 😀",0
Too many adds these days,0
The app's performance is degrading. It crashes/fails to load content too often. The loading speed is slow and unreliable.,0
Yeah it's reddit. I hate it but I keep coming back,0
It kind of works but is still cruddy compared to the 3rd party apps they banned.,0
"This app has gone downhill significantly and fast lately. No longer works on my media pad. Tried it on my galaxy, but now it requires a login just to browse. Nope! Not interested anymore.",0
Doesnt save setting changes,0
"Very feature minimal and frustrating app, I do not want a deluge of suggestions and I also don't want my feed to turn into a ghost town just because I turn those suggestions off. It doesn't help that there are odd bugs lingering around like not being able to minimize comments when there's a gif anywhere because it opens the gif instead if you don't hold to minimize",0
Good website. Terrible app,0
Please revert back to the previous ui and animations. The new ones are laggy and the new ui feels extremely different to navigate,0
"The layout and functionality of this app is mediocre at best, and it keeps getting worse. They keep updating it with ""gestures"" that only make it harder to use and adding in useless features like forcing a gif to play in a bar at the top of the screen while reading its comments. It's not youtube, Reddit, don't try to make it be. If you're not already hooked on using Reddit, do yourself a favor and pass it up. They obviously don't care about what their users think anymore.",0
Like reddit a lot but needs more control for the user Because in many ways some admins are power crazy and the bots are just useless not all people need controlled,0
Unstable,0
"Good for taking care of some particular needs, beside that it's a torment to use",0
"I was swiping to see multiple pics in an album from *one* particular post then was utterly confused.... Turns out the app will keep showing you pictures from the next post. This isnt instagram or whatever? I want to digest what the user posted in one post before moving on to the next one. Actually the swiping thing is annoying, sometimes Ill swipe pics in a post on my feed, then Im moved to the popular feed and its really annoying. Im not a cat I dont need things to be so flowy to be amused.",0
You made the app worse. I was writing a comment and mistakenly went back and the feed page refreshed and I lost the link to where I was. Reddit is becoming like Quora. Fix this.,0
"Banning people with no reason at all, they dont like what you say, you are Banned. I liked to read a few subs, but thats just silly what the admins are doing. Deleted the App now.",0
"This app ould be so much better yet they choose to try and become tik tok. If I wanted the tik tok experience, I'm on there but I'm not, I'm on your app, I want to see comments not just videos, I want to scroll without the interface randomly stopping, I don't want to view the same post 8 times a day. Stop throwing features in people don't want and fix what people actually want, specially considering you don't want people to use third party apps.",0
Its so sad that most video creating apps are mainly covered with porn and sexual stuff it's Lowkey a disappoint. Its useless now because of it,0
"I've used it for a while now, not really understanding what it was at first. Posts are interesting, but the nested threads after threads are annoying. I recently discovered some things about avi personalization that I thought was cool. There's a lot of information to take in on the platform. I just wonder if there isn't a better, more effective way. Also, it's hard to get back to what you were looking at, and that pisses me off every time.",0
"Never mind they bought back the new menu again and its a clustered mess again so yeah back down you go. If you take away user friendliness and make it more difficult to use then you know... Old rev. reverting back from the last update, the use of menu after that update was beyond appalling. Gracii",0
"Sure would be great if Reddit didn't kill off all the other apps that work significantly better without at first ensuring that their app works just as well, but they did.",0
"it was a good, I really enjoyed it until when couldn't make no post nothing to do, but was active, and when I even tried creating a new account it was still same issue",0
The android version is better than the ios version but not by much,0
Very poor user experience. Hard to believe this is the official app of one of the most popular web sites on the internet,0
every update gets more and more buggy and laggy,0
Since losing 3rd party apps this one is a unfortunate replacement.,0
"Bugs in a incredible amount of places and functions. And has been like so for years. The app gets big updates every now and then, but the bugs persists.",0
"I generally like the app, but continue to get notifications for a community I haven't joined or subscribed to. I've even muted it now, but still I'm getting notifications.",0
"""chat notification"" on the chat tab is super annoying. There's no way to get rid of the notification. A disable setting badly needed.",0
This app is worst i mean u can find any voilent graphic things exist on earth it just randomly appear while u were on searching of something different and formal topic..,0
"Downgraded original 3* review since the video player has become even more wonky, and they removed the ability to sort your feed by recent, hot, etc. It's annoying to have to go into Settings to sort, while individual subreddits still allow for sorting from the menu bar. I hope this ""feature"" is reverted soon. (General navigation still sucks, but I had gotten used to it.)",1
"It's not total garbage but pretty much sucks compared to the many 3rd party apps they killed. Unfortunately it's also mandatory if you want to see anything tagged NSFW so you might as well install it. Among the things most lacking is the ability to format contents. You have to use markup for everything links. It also likes to collapse comments when you have your finger on the screen slowly scrolling or when tapping links. In other words, it fails at what is essentially the heart of Reddit.",1
I don't know what they did to this app recently but it's gotten super annoying. As your scrolling it likes to start playing audio from a video from post that are like four or five above where you're looking at depending on the direction you're scrolling. I have to turn audio on and off in between scrolling each post so that it's not just this constant replaying of the exact same sound over and over.,1
"Annoying Notifications. Look, if you're going to clog up my phone with notifications, when I click on one, it needs to go to the thing I clicked on. This app, like many others, keeps a notification on your phone and when you click it, it just takes you to some random home page. Not the thing you clicked on. Shut them all off. They don't matter.",1
"This app is an amazing interface and pleasant experience for a mobile experience... However, this app uses way, way more data than it should. It's truly absurd how much data it consumes, it's to the point that's it unacceptable. (Google it, people do complain about this) A mobile app should be friendly towards data, most people don't have unlimited data plans.",1
"Love the platform itself, but the app has some awful bugs to it. For one, I've had to reinstall the app on multiple occasions due to the fact at some point the app refuses to connect to the service and afaik, there is no way to fix connectivity issue other than doing a fresh install. Another issue is everything related to videos (upload/watch). There are some other smaller bugs, like have to reopen for the scroll function to work properly, your feed resetting, and the app being slow sometimes.",1
"It's a good app, just annoyed that I can no longer read reddit posts on the web. It has to force me to the app or force people to make an account. Also, recently, for some reason, when I save an image, it will send it to a different folder and the image will be 0 bytes. It saves as a dead image. I move it to a different folder but it just won't recognize it as a file. I have to screenshot the images now which are not the original quality.",1
"About 90% of the time when I go to post a pic from my phone it gives the ""Unable to post pic"" error message. it also does the rubberband feed behavior sometimes that is common on FB, where you go back to your feed after looking at a post and the feed 'jumps' to the top making you lose your place in your scrolling. Very frustrating. please fix.",1
"I'm fine with the app itself. I think it's the best reddit experience in terms of the UI and overall look. However it is significantly slower than other apps when loading things like photo, video, and really anything else. The avatar feature has recently been added to reddit and it's a buggy mess. I go into it and can't change a thing because it just says ""uh oh we hit a snag"" and it won't reload. However the app still works.",1
"The gui is really good at hiding basic things sometimes. Also it frequently fails to show the sub's custom graphics like custom up/down arrow appearance, or sidebar image. It can be really spammy with push notifications and clicking those push notifications often freezes the app or opens new instances of it. I once had 7 or 8 instances of the app running in my phone at once. But overall I can't deny it is a faster and smoother experience than using the mobile browser.",1
"It's hard to review the reddit app as it changes on a fairly regular basis. Options come and go with no real explanation. Good points: you can swipe through reddit with relative ease. Notifications are customisable. It's easy to save and share posts. Bad points: video posts stop playing at random intervals. Regular app crashes and general instability. Loads of ads, which can't be blocked even if they are inappropriate or offensive.",1
"For the most part the app is good, but recently i've been having a LOT of issues switching between subs and/or the homepage, like i'll click back or the little X at the top and instead of going to the homepage it'll close the app, i'll reopen and it's still on the same page or another recently visited post or sub and I'll have to repeat this process again and again or shut the app down. I also have multiple accounts and now trying to switch back and forth crashes the app",1
"I recently switched to android from iOS and I have two major complaints. First, collapsing comments by pressing and holding the comment for a bit is bogus. It works when you don't want it to and it doesn't work when you do. On the iOS version of the app, it was a simple tap to collapse and it was awesome. My second issue is not being able to swipe to the next picture within a subreddit. You can't do it and it's horrible because the iOS version can.",1
"Too many bugs when it comes to videos. I'll be playing a video with sound on, back it up a couple seconds, it mutes itself. Or I'll be playing with sound on and rotate my phone, mutes itself. Or I'll look at a posts' comments and rotate my phone only for the app to load the ad right below the post on the feed. And if my sound was on on the previous video, the sound is automatically on for every future video with no settings to adjust it.",1
"Playing videos doesn't work half of the time. It will constantly buffer. But if I go on Reddit via chrome, videos play and don't buffer with no problems. Uploading videos worked for me in the past, but now that also has issues and gets stuck in an endless loop of it saying that it's uploading. This app gets pretty frustrating and I hope they fix it. For now, I'll just use chrome.",1
"It's adequate for an app. I find it more difficult to find my subreddit subscriptions and do not like that it will be not allow rotation from portrait to landscape viewing, which I prefer most of the time when using my tablet, and, sometimes when laying down on my side reading. So, it's just OK. This is my only device (cell phone) that I use the actual app on. My other 2, (tablet & another phone) I use my browser, to use Android/Chrome, due to the limitations I mentioned above.",1
"This app is very well made and a good example of adapting a website to mobile. Its sleek and easy to go through, and the option of a dark mode is nice. But this app crashes a lot, almost every time I open it, it will crash. It is to frequent go ignore and is honestly annoying. Everything else is very good and I will continue to use this app even if it feels like it doesent want me to use it.",1
"Quite buggy. When I click on a post (photo or video thumbnail) 99% it just shows a black screen. I have to click on comments, then click the photo/video to view. Half of the time the video doesn't play. Sometimes when I am done with the post & comment section and back out, it backs out to itself and requires 2-3 times more before I'm back to the main page. It is usable enough for basic, casual scrolling.",1
"There is a lot I like about this app. I like the interface much better than the website. However, it is next to impossible to post images or video... even text sometimes. It just says submitting and gets stuck with a spinning wheel until you have to force close the app. Or it just disappears. It isn't my internet, it is the app and has been consistently having this issue for a long time. Great app, but posting content is half of what I want to use it for, and it needs some fixing.",1
"I like the layout, it's easy to navigate, but there are a lot of bugs. The latest issue is that you can't open posts. When I try, the app freezes up and won't do anything until I close it. This happens when I either try to look at comments or open the full image. In the past it's also randomly force closed on me. Or I'll tap on one post, but it opens a different one, and won't let me look at the post I actually wanted. Would be fine without the annoying glitches.",1
"It is super annoying that the website popups to use the app are so rampant and pushy and the app doesn't even work properly. Recently, under the first few comments on a post, a list of other interesting posts are listed. If that shows up even a tiny bit on the screen, trying to scroll only refreshes the page. Even if you can't see the top of the screen, it refreshes. *Went up a star because improvement. The app still won't scroll during video playback. Pausing helps but we shouldn't have to.",1
"I use it a lot, but man sometimes it just doesn't do basic things. They've clearly been futzing with the scroll behavior, and still haven't gotten it right (can't scroll to the bottom, sometimes can't scroll all the way to the top). And yeah, video playback is weird too. Sometimes there's supposed to be sound and I can't get the controls to show up without screwing up the playback. None of these behaviors are consistent though, so it's hard to figure out a workaround, if one even exists",1
"I love the fact that I can use reddit in my mobile device with this app, I also like the interface on this. Wat I don't like is the fact that I have to put up with hearing at least 4 notification sounds even though it's for the same single notification, I know this doesn't seem that much of a problem but when I would hear the number of notification sounds I expect at least the same amount of notifications when I check my phone. It also really bothers me like just getting 2 notifications and then hearing 8 notification sounds, please fix this bug.",1
"I usually don't rate Apps, but Reddit has been bad lately. I've tried deleting and redownloading the app because my feed won't load half the time; and the other half, when it does, it won't load the post but /will/show it. I don't know if it's a Galaxy problem, a connection problem, or what -- but someone needs to check into that. Otherwise, I really love Reddit :(",1
"It's a good app, but some of the ""features"" can get really annoying with no way to turn them off. I.E. holding on a comment to hide it. I have a large phone and sometimes my finger will be supporting the screen while holding it. This will hide the comment I'm reading and can become very annoying when I'm reading short stories from writing prompts.",1
"The idea of reddit itself is what I love.. The app not so much. I am constantly having problems with it since I've installed it and even after updates. I have to re open it all the time to even look at comments.. Re open it to go to another sub.. Repoen it to post and sometimes re open it to re open it!!(but seriously I've had to re open the app 2-3 times at once just to post something) I am always getting the, ""Something went wrong. "" message.. Ugh!!!!!!",1
"An extremely mediocre mobile client as of the moment. #1 issue right now is the video player, which hogs excessive amounts of data and sometimes doesn't play videos at all, which pretty much forces you to restart the app to fix it (even then it's temporary, this bug has been happening for years and the devs still haven't fixed it). Posts also take a rather long time to load, though it's more usable than the videos (unless it's a GIF, then it's just as broken).",1
"I really like reddit and I use the app on a daily basis. The one thing that has been driving me absolutely nuts about this app is when I use the search bar. If I search and open a post from the search results, then go back to continue looking at the search results, it resets to the very top of the result list, and I don't remember it doing that before. Please fix this.",1
"As of around the 1st of April they updated the app which absolutely killed my battery. Even when not in use my phone would be physically hot. Checked my network data and Reddit was making tracking calls every 2 seconds all day and all night. Force killed it and battery was so much better. But started again when I restarted the phone. Not worth doing every time. Very poor development work. Hopefully they work it out, but I've moved on.",1
"User interface impedes finding most subs. It pushes users to shift through the front page for content. Not sure if it's my phone or the app, but auto-brightness makes it tough to view some images with my screen tilted sideways, which is the best way to view large images, in particular the most coveted Virgin vs Chad memes. Overall it gets the job done, but it could be a lot better.",1
"I enjoy reddit but there are definitely some clunky elements. It seems to take longer to load everything on this app as apposed to Facebook or surfing chrome. I mean everything, from loading and zooming around pictures to loading comment chains, its markedly slower than other apps. Not to mention it auto making links that don't work on my app. For example, ill try to load 2+ pics at a time and it will generate a link to take them to a gallery. And the link will not work. At least for me.",1
"App is fine for browsing. I just wish I wasn't forced to download the app. I can't even view the website anymore without some box popping up to tell me to view in the app. And now there's no option to continue via chrome anymore. If I don't continue in the app it takes me to r/popular, which is not the subreddit I was in. If I try to go back to where I was, the same box pops up again. Some people don't want to download apps all the time. It takes up memory you can use for other things.",1
"Frequently, updates create fun new bugs and glitches that weren't there before, despite the long list they provide every update of all the bugs they've fixed. I like Reddit, and browse it frequently, but this is about the app, and as far as the app goes, there's always something new that's broken or missing, or malfunctioning, or maybe even just hindering my user experience, even if it technically isn't broken, just because it's really inconvenient or poorly designed. I expect a lot from an app for such a popular website and I don't feel like it delivered.",1
"It's a fine app. Occasionally has issues opening. Would prefer if it didn't ask me to rate it constantly. If it was good enough or bad enough for me to feel the need to rate it I would have done it ages ago, but it's just... OK. I'd rather view content on my browser instead of having a dedicated app that I have to sign into honestly, but they make that experience extra annoying or force you to use the app for some things.",1
"App is okay. But since the previous update, and continuing in the last update, the audio from one post continues after you scroll past it. It will even continue when you try to open another video so you have the audio from both videos playing. That original audio cannot be stopped by muting it. The only way to get it to stop is to close the app and relaunch. Other than that I have no complaints.",1
"Love Reddit, but they've really ramped up advertising. Like, a lot. To the detriment of it's efficiency as well as usability. Not a fan of that. It's one thing to advertise on your app/site. It's another to drown your loyal customer base with as much as 3 ads in a row in the feed, with seemingly fewer true content posts in between.",1
I really love reddit and being part of the community. It's full of great contact. The biggest issue I have is that videos play horribly in the app. They sometimes never start. And if they do they almost always pause halfway through and never finish. It is very rare that videos EVER finished playing. It is VERY annoying and it honestly makes the app very inconvienent to use versus the website. Other app users have mentioned the issue too in comments and posts so I know its not only me.,1
"After scrolling for a few minutes, the app will eventually stop loading images and video. As far as I can tell, only closing and reopening the app ""fixes"" that. Also, on videos it is kind of annoying that the video dims when showing the controls. If its a short video or gif, I can't really see the content simply because I just hit play.",1
"in my personal experience, it works... fine. the only issue i have is that the media player just kinda dies after a few minutes, nothing will play until i restart the app. it's pretty annoying and the fact that well over a dozen people complain and it's not getting fixed is concerning. i deleted the app off my phone months ago but i thought i would review nonetheless.",1
"Been on this app for almost 8 years, and the last 2 I've seen updates that just screws up the mobile experience. Can't get scrolling to function at times; either can't go all the way down or up. Now the new mode won't just open the small screen of the post with comments beneath. And now when you want to get it odd your screen, when you scroll up, it pulls up another post instead of going back to the previous. Annoying af when they change this stuff when its been that way FOR YEARS.",1
"About 1/5 videos either wont play, or will fail halfway through, forcing you to copy+paste the URL into your phone browser to watch the rest as you avoid the ""open in app!"" ads on the website. It has gotten better over time -- it used to be that only 1/3 videos could run at all -- but still needs a lot of work.",1
App is mostly pretty good. The one big issue I have had is that it is insanely frustrating trying to read longer comments because if you just barely touch the screen for a moment too long it will collapse the entire thread. After the fourth or fifth time you have to scroll up and find the thread you were just reading you might want to throw your phone at the wall.,1
"This app used to be fine for easily accessing both my curated list of subreddits, and the front page of /r/all. Unfortunately, recent updates have made it a lot more inconvenient to access both of these, hiding them behind a screen of seemingly random posts that take up the full screen and must be navigated around. I know this sounds like ""everything used to be fine until they changed it,"" and I guess it is, but they are deliberately making their tool harder to use by removing functionality.",1
"Its Reddit, on mobile. Quick, easy, intuitive UI. There still is ONE glaring problem (which I would dock more if I didn't enjoy Reddit). Why is the Reddit app viewable in portrait mode? I wont the auto rotate like most apps of lesser quality and budget. please for the love of all mobile and tablet users, enable this simple option. I have my 2-n-1 tablet and am forced to either take it out of its case and stand to hold it in portrait mode.",1
"Great social media and one of the best by far, but I just have problems with the app itself. A good 90% of the time, videos or gifs just refuse to play and just stay on the first frame no matter how long I wait. This is a glaring issue that I think holds this app back immensely. Other than some loading issues it is pretty solid. Another thing I have always prided reddit on is a lack of watermarks. The new watermark feature makes reddit no better than apps such as ifunny and i dont like it at all",1
"After an update(02/2022) the app is working as intended again, or at least how it was before I was unable to get past an infinite loading screen. The new tik tok video player ripoff is still a step in the wrong direction imo. Now whenever you open a video post, even by only tapping the title or comments and NOT the vid, it will autoplay, this even happens if you have autoplay turned off. When you used to be able to swipe up or down to exit the vid, now it will load a random ""similar"" post.",1
"Mistakes were made. Settings aren't saving properly, leading to incorrect information being displayed and need to exit and re-enter for each change. Also, you reset our settings; bad practice. Never reset user settings without notice or consent. Our phones, our rules. Not the best update experience but I managed to find my way around these issues. Please take note for improvement.",1
"Overall, I like the app. It is very easy to use and navigate, and is very streamlined. Managing multiple accounts and switching between them is easy too. The reason I a only giving 3 stars is that all video content has no audio. Want audio? Then you have to open the post in a browser, which defeats the purpose. Funnily enough, the site will display ""better in the app"" when you do this, but if it is a video post, that is not the case. I I will update to 5 stars if/when this gets fixed.",1
"I enjoy the site but lately the app has had more bugs than ever, and the usual tricks ie. restart/reinstall don't fix. Collapsing threads with a long press works ~75% of the time. When I try to click a name from a comment the profile doesn't open. Volume control needs work, I open a post with audio on I get blasted with junk music from an ad above comments that I'm unable to turn off or hide, and continues to play when I back out and open another post, and over other post's sounds, obnoxious.",1
"Good way to view reddit, but there are two major problems that could use improvement, both really seem more of a reddit issue than an app issue, but app based solutions would be appreciated. The first is the lesser one... the unavoidable live banner. If it was for matters of importance, fine... but sports and ads? Not so much. The other is the ads disguised as posts. I have no problem with ads and only use blockers when absolutely necessary, but I hate being lied to. And fake post ads are that.",1
"Very likeable community. I've been having a great experience here with the communities. Only problem I'm having is its a bit difficult to get things posted. More specifically images. It's buggy. It sometimes stalls/loops on ""submitting"" when posting images or it doesn't appear on my posts at all and can't. Even the mods can be dumb when something is clearly related to the subject at hand when posted. Basically bias if you asked me.",1
"Always a great resource. It's a great app for learning new things, engaging in some fun discourse, or to just generally pass the time in an entertaining and educational way. Literally any subject that one would like to ask questions on or read up about is going to be covered on Reddit. Since I'm fairly new to using the app, I can't really comment on the more technical aspects, but in my opinion it's easy to use/ pretty user-friendly.",1
"From a content standard, there is always something interesting. But something seems to have happened in one of the recent updates, when responding to something lengthy that another user has posted, if the text falls below the line of the top of the keyboard, the window no longer scrolls upwards. That makes the collaboration part a bit more difficult. Hopefully this will get fixed.",1
"The experience is Reddit for all its greatness and warts... However the app itself is buggy and has issues with video playback. Video playback is never an easy thing, but it works 24 out of 25 times, but that last 4% is always buggy... I wonder if they are A/B testing and failing to recognize that it fails or what... But regardless, it is annoying.",1
Please consider implementing the following features that were included with RIF: -Jump back to prior page when accidentally double clicking the back button. Really frustrating to go back to the home feed when I was far down scrolling through a subreddit. -App refreshes to latest home feed posts after coming back to the app a few hours later. Would like to resume scrolling from where I was last time I was browsing.,1
I love reddit. It has flaws like their is so many times where when I open the app it's just a black screen and won't load. Idk why that is and it's extremely irritating as I just wanna go on. I would give this app 4 stars but it deserves 3 due to this happening. Anyone else have the same problem and have a solution other than uninstalling it and reinstalling it and even then it still may happen.,1
"The app works well for the most part, except that it is the single biggest data hog on my phone by orders of magnitude. It makes everything take forever to load if my connection isn't 100%. The option to view low-res thumbnail previews for images, gifs, and videos is a feature this app is sorely lacking, and the primary reason why I make so much less use of it now that I don't have a hardline internet connection. If I didn't have an unlimited data plan, it would be unusable.",1
I like the app and would like to give it a 4 or 5 star rating if there was audio sound. Out of a hundred hours and a thousand videos viewed i may have heard audio not more than 30 minutes from 20 videos and it's not my phone because the other 30 apps all have audio sound and it's the same thing on my tablet and my neighbors phone. At one point I was starting to believe that the app doesn't support audio sound and one time a speaker 🔇 popped up for me to unmute the sound. Last time ever seen it.,1
"I've been a reddit user for nearly a decade and it's been fairly consistent with performance and usability. There must recent few updates has caused an explosion of ads though. I understand a need to make money but I find myself spending less time on the app and more time on the web interface where I can block ads completely. Push less ads and I'll come back to the app. Until then, you'll be making less money from me as I'll just use adblock.",1
"App is good but not great. It would be nice to have landscape mode for tablets. Also, video uploads are always hit or miss. Another gripe I have is that every time I have to restart my tablet or it dies and I gotta charge it, reddit doesn't work and I have to completely uninstall reddit then reinstall it every time. I just try to keep my tablet charged so I don't have to do that, but it's still really annoying when I have to do it.",1
"App is pretty inconvenient, multi image posts don't show up apart from whatever fits in the square, and the comments load forever. Interface is mostly clunky and the lack of easy messaging or chat room differentiation can be a major let down. However, in what it does aim to do works a decent amount, and yes you can browse reddit just fine for the most part. It's functional but also mildly annoying.",1
"This app works a little more slowly than just pulling up Reddit on Google Chrome. The difference is only apparent on slow WiFi connection, though. I also don't like automatically being subscribed to 20 pages that I don't want to see. It would be nice to be able to unsubscribe from a subreddit without having to visit the page so that the app doesn't think you actually want suggestions based on that one time you visited r/creepy to unsubscribe from it.",1
"It is an interesting social media app to use. However, there is one major problem with this app that I hope would get fixed soon-the video player. Most of the time, it lags and, in some cases, doesn't even respond. The app is also not as easy to use as others, so that is why I am giving it a 3 star rating. (It could have been a 4 if the video player works)",1
"Hey, Reddit. What the heck!? You've been around for far too long with way to unimpressive of a mobile platform simply because your audio and video streaming SUUUUUUUCKS! Like, I have to close your app and reopen it every 10 minutes if I'm using it otherwise the video just freezes and doesn't want to play. Not to mention that half the videos that are supposed to have sound are mute because of whatever reason. Then came this last update that only made stuff worse. Videos are super glitchy.",1
"With all the craziness going on in the world right now, reddit has been a boon. However, I've been experiencing near constant app crashes for the better part of a week and a half now. I uninstalled / reinstalled the app three times, force quit more times than I can count, reset my phone, all the typical fixes. Still having the same issue. I'm not sure if it's just due to the fact the servers are full or if it's an unreported glitch. That being said, I figured it was worth bringing it up.",1
"I enjoy Reddit thoroughly, but the app needs work. I am constantly having to reset because the videos just stop working, or don't work at all. Sometimes they'll work through auto play, then when I click on it, it freezes. Clicking play button over and over, waiting, still won't work.... yet the videos scrolled under work just fine? Exasperating. Can't necessarily give a 5 star rating until this is no longer an issue. I can't stand it.",1
"These past 2 or 3 weeks the app has been exceptionally slow. It's like I tap a post, then wait an actual minute or two to open. It doesn't even have to be a big or popular post, I mostly browse smaller hobby subreddits. This seems consistent whether it's a small text post with 5 replies or a front page video with 400 replies. At first I thought it was my phone service, but other social media apps and video sites still load fast.",1
"Missing many features that are standard in most 3rd party apps, such as: advanced video and animated GIF playback controls and the simple ability to zoom during playback, one-tap comment thread collapsing, context-dependant tap-and-hold menus, etc, etc. Have preferred 3rd party Reddit apps for years, but with the new API restrictions, dealing with this base model official app is migraine inducing and an exercise in frustration.",1
"The app has been good for years, but has slowly declined the last year or two. it's pretty plagued by annoying bugs. Videos often won't play after a while, profiles stop loading after a few scrolls, the feed and user profile both glitch after exiting a video. The feed refreshes to the top when you back out of videos, and users profiles will refresh to random points in their feed when back out of videos. Needs some work.",1
"Enjoy the accessibility of Reddit on the go. Though it can be buggy at times (like chats, messages, and notifications) and I feel like they keep taking away features. Can't seem to sort the post on my profile anymore and have to manually scroll to find something that I maybe didn't save. Overall it's a decent app and gets the job done but all these minor inconveniences and inconsistencies really hurt the app.",1
"To be honest, it crashes randomly and often. I have a galaxy S8 and sometimes I just get the black screen of death from the app. I update it often. I turn my phone on and off. It is not a well optimized app. I enjoy browsing on it, but not when it gives my phone catastrophic errors.",1
"It's not bad but there's a couple disadvantages to using the app instead of the mobile browser. For one, I haven't been able to figure out how to see my post history. I'm not sure if that's even an option. Also I can't have multiple windows open to hop back and fourth from different posts', which is how I always like to browse reddit in the past. And now that I finally went ahead and downloaded the app I'm getting a bunch of spam email from reddit so thanks a lot for that!",1
"Love reddit, and just made the switch from a 3rd party to the native app. As a user who uses private messages a lot, I wish it were easier to use these functions. And I've experienced some bugs when using the back button -- sometimes it's the only way to exit, say, a chat, but when I use it, the entire app closes. Still prefer the old desktop experience, but the app ain't bad.",1
"My review originally was 5 stars purely for the content. However, I realised the app and platform have literal nothing to do with the content. Here's why Reddit gets a 3/5 from me: 1. The UI is not customizable at all. Accessing my favourite subs is a longer process than I'd like, especially given that... 2. The app is poorly optimized and uses tons of memory even while minimised. These two issues (crowded UI and bad optimization) both undercut the best part is Reddit - the content.",1
"This is a pretty good app. Solid, but when I'm reading a subreddit and a link takes me to a page, the app refreshes automatically and doesn't allow me to return to the point in the subreddit that I just used to follow the link. It's frustrating and I wish the developer would address it or at least provide an option to stop the refresh.  The other problem is that I'll be in the middle of a subreddit, having scrolled through a lot of posts, and will be interrupted for a bit by a phone call or the like, then come back to the app and it will exit where I was on the subreddit, return to ""New Posts"" of all my subscriptions, ruining my progress in that particular subreddit. There's no setting I can find that will correct this behavior. It makes the phone experience much less enjoyable than the desktop experience.",1
"Its a decent app. Kinda confusing at first, as there is so much going on in the ui, but after a little time exploring, its getting easier. Two problems. Befor ei start, please know that im gonna be a little bit petty. 1. Every time i attempt to customize my avatar the app crashes. 100% failure rate. 2. Notifications are bugged. They simply come and go as they please, and its resulted in me missing out on some great oppurtunities, and wasted the time of other people. Thats all.",1
"I love Reddit, but I've been having a continuous problem with uploading photos from Android. I've tried several different tactics to fix this, including switching from data to wifi, wifi to data, uploading the image as a screenshot, etc. Sometimes these work, sometimes they don't. Please please PLEASE fix this! It's been an issue for months for me and from what I can tell, many others as well.",1
"Reddit is good. The app has problems with video - sometimes they autoplay (and continue to repeat if I scroll past the post again), sometimes they don't load properly and I can only hear the sound over a black or white screen, and trying to scroll through the comments on any video is bad. Also, when downvoted comments are hidden, I can't open the bottom-most comment to see the rest of the thread because the lower part of the app shows a current user count that encroaches on it.",1
"App won't even start. When I'm not using it, it blows up my phone with error messages that take up half my screen saying ""reddit keeps stopping."" I could barely get it to chill out just long enough to uninstall so I could use my phone. Other than that MAJOR issue, it was good. Please patch so I can use it. I'm using a galaxy A10-E, if that's relevant.",1
"(9/2/20) This app really needs improvement. I've only been using it for about a month, and even in that short span of time I have seen it go downhill. I can't see any of the comments under one of my photos, and uploading a photo (both to my user page and under any subreddit) has not been possible within the past three days. Videos will switch to extremely low quality with no reason or notice. Photos load slower than ever. It all happens both while using my cellular and while using internet.",1
I don't know what you was going for in the last couple updates but the up and down arrows being at the bottom of the app now is making me interact with them less and less. When I watch videos I'm using my right hand to scroll. The arrows are on the far bottom left. I rather do one gesture with my thumb and go to the next video then do some extra stuff to up a video. Add double tap at least.,1
"I really like Reddit itself, however it's like this app was coded by a 4 year old. One of the main issues I've noticed is the connection is constantly freezing up, not loading anything at all until you restart the app. And videos are just a pain in the arse to get to play and if you have anything playing in the background such as music, any unmuted video you come across will pause it immediately. Reddit itself is pretty great though there's a community for literally anyone/thing within the law.",1
"Surprisingly unintitive. For example, the process for creating a post gives no indication on how to add text! I've tapped everywhere and haven't found it yet. Thinking I could submit and edit the post, your new post vanishes after submission. If you hunt it down there seems to be no edit, so the best you can do is respond to yourself in a post with the message. Other elements of the app are equally clumsy.",1
"Love the desktop site and the app (when it works). I've been having a lot of problems with freezes on the app lately, though. Clearing the cache and force stopping hasn't worked. I've also had many incidents where the app fails to load anything, even though others are working just fine.",1
"A decent social media app that crashes a bit too often. There's also this bug I found where whenever I close a post (also sometimes also sometimes when I just tab in/out of the app) that a short half second audio clip plays. It's different audio every time, but mostly consists of groups of people screaming (though I've also heard calm talking, desparate crying and police sirens). I would very much appreciate it if you fixed this problem in a future version, as I prefer my apps to not be haunted.",1
"This app used to be just perfect before. Not sure what happened but it takes forever to load for posts and sometimes it never does. I love the mobile version so much more and really hope that this is fixed. Ensure that when a post is opened that it doesn't stay in limbo loading and have it running efficiently like it used to. It's gotten increasing frustrating lately and I'm obviously not the only one to feel this way. Please fix the app!! - Sincerely, redditors everywhere",1
"I like reddit. But the app always seems to circumvent my phone settings and start sending me notificatioms and burning through my battery when I'm not using it. This may be due to a lack of proficiency with my own cell phone. But it's still annoying. I've already removed the app from my phone once for this resdon, and thi king of doing it again.",1
"I think it is a great app aside from the fact that random videos choose not to play. Whenever they do manage to play, the screen does not rotate when I rotate my phone. I have to view everything with my phone in vertical. These are essentially my only gripes for an otherwise great app.",1
"Videos constantly lag/buffer; settings could be improved. Video: checked other apps on wifi and data, no issues running smoothly elsewhere so it's a Reddit problem. Videos are stopping to buffer every few seconds which definitely deters me from using the app. Settings: specifically for audio - would be nice to scroll without autoplay sound on videos and then play sound on them when actually opened. That isn't an option. Having to find the unmute button every time seems unnecessary.",1
"Two problems I've always had in the 2 years of using this app are a). At times when I'm scrolling down my feed (on the popular page and on my personalized feed) it will stop loading new posts. Like I straight up just reached the end of all posts. And b). Sometimes photos, and at all times videos, do not load unless I'm connected to my wifi. And even then the videos buffer and dont have the greatest quality. I give 3 stars for app performance, but the social platform of Reddit itself is great.",1
"UPDATE: Downgrade from 5 stars to 3 stars. Disconnect between the app and the teaser/adviser emails from Reddit. Am seldom able to open the article/app thru the email (which at one time auto opened the stories thru the app), it just goes solid black. Annoyed, I seldom close the email acct and open the app to read articles, even if interested by the tease. Too much work to navigate to ""my subject"" stories, even when advised. Thus seldom use Reddit.",1
"Latest client update made navigation on mobile more annoying to deal imo. Watching videos turns into a mess when you just wanna read comments or just go back to previous page. And that when videos even wanna play, seriously, when's reddit gonna deal with video playback and image loading issues, it can get super laggy at times, or just don't even load period. Still enjoying it but these issues seem like reddit isn't doing anything to fix em. Also wish they'd add a bookmark feature for browsing.",1
"I absolltley love reddit, my only gripe with this app is the lay out and bugs. I am running the android version on a chromebook. When browing in wide screen mode, there is just a single collum in the midle with negitive space on the sides. Also when trying to select certain things such as if i want to post as text, link, ect the options will be cut off and i dont know what i am selecting except by using trial and error. i know chrome is just introducing android apps and there is still work to be done for optimization, but i hope these bugs and features can be fixed soon.",1
"unreliable and flaky. app is repeatedly unable to open posts that it notifies about. then, minutes later, while browsing, or sometimes after restating it, it would take me to the post I clicked notification for long time ago. app is unable to open when started from Chrome; when opening reddit posts in Chrome, upon selecting ""open with app"" all I get is an activity with reddit icon in the center. nothing more happens.",1
"Five stars for experience, minus two for technical issues. After updating yesterday it won't let me expand on posts. It just gives me a blank screen. It won't let me access my saves, either. I've tried uninstalling it and restarting my phone. Nothing works. I'll rate five stars when the app lets me do these things without hassle, because without these things it (obviously) makes the app unusable.",1
"So, it was working fine. The normal complaints everyone has about the app, but today, I can't log into either of my accounts. Even though my information is correct, it just wouldn't log me in and give the ""having trouble reaching Reddit"" message. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but still nothing. I don't know if this is an issue other people are dealing with, but now the app is just useless.",1
There are just two minor fixes that would vastly improve the quality of the official Reddit app: efficient scrolling and preloading the detail view of posts that are in the viewport. Together these two issues create a massive amount of frustration and lead to session abandonment. It's insane that a multi-billion dollar media platform whose primary user interaction is scrolling is unable to render their UI without jitter or lag.,1
"Visually impaired users beware. apparent inability to easily change font size is inexplicable in 2022. The lack of a low contrast color option (grey on black at night \ white on grey in day) is a real bummer. Black and white is ok in daylight but a real pain, literally, at night when the lights are off. Hilarious that the ""AMOLED"" option turns the contrast UP. Reddit devs should look at how Ableton live handles color and contrast.",1
"Most things work great. The things that don't work great are incredibly frustrating. It takes like a whole minute to load comments on practically any post even though it's instant on desktop. Audio for auto playing videos will play even when the video isn't on screen (before or after it shows up). You get the same ad over and over for weeks or months on end. If everything else didn't work okay, I'd have already switched to another app.",1
"Decent overall but has some glaring lacking features. Intrusive ads when scrolling, touchy landscape/portrait when full screen videos, the app has an error sometimes where it says that it is having trouble connecting to reddit and cannot load anything. Cannot copy and paste text either which is a huge pain when some subreddits require a specific title format.",1
"Still a great app, but some things need fixing. App consistently crashes around 5 mins of use. GIFS stop playing and doesn't allow me to reset it unless I click on the link. Images don't load. I have to wait to reply to someone for an amount of time even though I've never had that issue before. These are only a few problems I've encountered, but it's still a great app. Buy please try to fix these things. It's been like that for a year and I've tried everything to fix them with no fix.",1
"It's an alright app, however I've noticed posts from specific users showing up on my timeline, but later on when I go to reference the post from their profile, the post is nowhere to be found. It's not an update thing as far as I know, and it's made things slightly more difficult if I forget to like or comment so I can reference it on my own profile.",1
"This review would be 5 stars if it worked more consistently. I can't tell you how many times I've opened the app, only to have it crash or I'll receive a notice saying something along the lines of Reddit being down. Also, there will be times when I go to click on a thread and it will take FOREVER to open, or better yet, it just keeps loading until I give up and close the app. And when I go back to try again, the same thing happens. For some reason it's worse when I'm connected to Wifi? Go figure",1
"I usually love the app, but lately (past few weeks), when I click a notification to read a post or reply to a comment, it'll simply open reddit, not the post. Sometimes, it'll eventually open the post if I go thru a few other posts, but usually, it won't. Not sure what changed cuz I've never had this problem before. Also, there's this annoying pop-up that shows up every time I screenshot something. I don't screenshot things to share, I SS so I can personally remember what the post says.",1
"To the guy that said his Home feed wasnt showing up, but was able to access all the other parts of the app, I'm having the same issue! It says ""Let's try Again. We had some trouble loading the data. Please try again."" And it's really starting the piss me off right about now. I thought it was just me that had the issue with the posts from my home feed, but I guess not! Again, I can access any other part of the app fine. I can search for subreddits and they'll show the posts like normal!",1
"I've used this app for over 2 years now. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent app and totally worth your time. The problem is that there are better alternatives out there that allow even more features and personalization. I switched because I found the loading times to be incredibly slow when opening the app for the first time. It's not a big deal, but it gets annoying after a while. Secondly, the ads look exactly like regular posts, which makes it easy to accidentally click on them.",1
"It can get very bad at times. It'll disconnect from the Internet, will stop playing videos and keep reverting to the home page when scrolling. Seems the controls aren't calibrated correctly or something. I'll tap one button for example to pause a video and it'll do something competently random like start playing another video. The only solution I've found for this is to keep closing and reopening the app every few minutes.",1
"Feels sluggish and heavy to use. Many areas need to be optimized, like when you're scrolling down and the audio from a video you haven't found yet (or already have scrolled past) suddenly starts playing. Important features to control behavior, which you find in unnoficial apps, are also lacking. Other than that, it's a decent enough app. EDIT: Tested the new update, and the audio issue seems to be fixed. I still think the 3 stars are appropriate, as the app still leaves a lot to be desired.",1
"The interface is very basic and could have a more modern design to look like a social network, users could be encouraged to use real photos instead of avatars, especially in ads, since every 3 posts 1 ad appears and there is no possibility of not even hiding this rubbish, so it ends up being annoying to see. The layout of the publications could be better, especially those with images and videos and the app seems to try to be a little bit of everything, a big shot in the foot, in short, it's OK.",1
"I've been using reddit regularly for the past 7 years. It's the only form of social media I regularly use. App is great but my only gripe is the lack of options and activity on Reddit chat. I'm disappointed there. Update: October 30, 2023. Chats have ceased to stop working for a bit. Chatting feature continues to have issues and seems to be worsening. Gonna have to dock a star down to 3 Update: I keep getting told to rate the app even though I already have. Still 3 stars...",1
It can be a great place to go deep into an internet rabbit hole. But recently I haven't been able to sync my Reddit account to my phone or tablet. It doesn't even allow me to turn sync on and this is annoying. PLEASE fix; the typical stuff like clearing cache hasn't helped at all.,1
"It's a great platform supposedly, just ridden with lots of annoying bugs. One of them is when you try to upload an image as a comment and it turns into an asterisk. You have to try again and again in order to be successful and it's getting super frustrating that you end up not engaging at all.",1
The way the replies to comments and the threads are set up is difficult to tell who said what when. The format is just weird and a bit confusing. It would also be better to give more suggested content. I feel like I get the exact same thing on my front page every day. It's also pretty difficult to go through your bookmarked posts and look for a post from a couple years ago. They should have like a filter system in the bookmarks for your profile,1
"Enjoying the app so far, a little bit glitchy, but when you refresh, it solves the problem. It's also recommended to download Imgur as a companion app to Reddit, so you can put links to your photographs to the platform (because if you use links from Instagram for your photos, it might not work).",1
"Mediocre. Reddit has been not great recently because of these reasons: - it bugs out constantly - it shows subreddits I already said I don't wanna see - Empty response from Endpoint. What does that even mean? Overall, needs a lot of work. 3 stars, mediocre. Fix it, or I'll switch more to DeviantArt.",1
The app is so frustrating. My homepage has been stuck for days. It happens at least 4 times a week and none of the usual tricks fix it. I'm thinking of permanently deleting the app and switching back to other more reliable social media. Would definitely not recommend.,1
"Love the app for the most part, but i say that as someone that just scrolls and usually doesn't engage. However, lately I can't open long image captions. I push more and just get the comments. Really frustrating, even after the update.",1
Don't get me wrong its a good app but it has one bug I hate. Sometimes when I go on reddit it say an error has occured. So I uninstall the app but then when I try to log back in it says unable to authinticate so I to wait then it will work. So far it hasn't done that but pls fix.,1
Good app overall. Only downside is they recently started suggesting subreddits to me that are very relevant to where I live despite not having access to location nor have I ever shared that info on reddit. So that's pretty suspicious. Data mining...,1
"Does ok to access reddit but would like the option to open more than one window at once. Also, quite a number of small irritations like losing the thread I was reading after a while and going back to a home page or whatever it goes to.",1
"Hello, could you please improve the loading time of pictures and stuff? It's a hassle to be constantly faced with similar issues while scrolling on reddit. When compared to other app, it doesn't happen to them as much as it's a problem of this app.",1
Good app to explore different things. But the problem is I get mail when someone direct messages me (that's great but) when I select view mail\message on Gmail It doesn't take me to message it just takes me to the home screen of the app.,1
"Usable. I mostly use it for the chat function to get notifications on my phone, but sometimes the messages are out of order. Annoying when it happens.",1
"Love reddit, but this app is terrible. The comments never load, even when there are clearly comments on posts, they'll never show up. Even refreshing and reloading reddit, even uninstalling and re-installing the app doesn't work. And I can't default to the web browser cause it wants me to only use the app. Real frustrating! Other than that, it is quite user friendly. The only downfall is the complete and utter lack of loading.",1
"Explanations are needed. For example, Flair. I know the dictionary definition, I don't understand how it's used on Reddit, especially when it's part of what's required in order to finish creating or responding to a post. My first avatar creation saved just fine. Two years later, it disappeared. Now, the free avatar creation will neither allow me to save nor will it tell me what I need to do so I can save it. Many similar items could use attention to increase ease of use and user satisfaction.",1
There were many issues. The primary for me was scrolling. That's fixed now. Would like more optimization and lower quality option for mobile data. Jitters in comment scrolling is still present. Watch section is jittery. Need to swipe twice to scroll next video.,1
Lack of audio on video clips linked and now you can't even get to the source. Notification pop ups block buttons until it times out. I.e. if you block a suggested sub a popup comes to say its blocked but you can't actually hit a confirm button. Really poor to see no fixes for bugs that should have been found via quality control and now even through community feedback.,1
"Largely the experience of using the app is decent, but the ability to navigate in and out of post and comment notifications could be better. Right now it is all nested inside profile sub menus which is a bit tedious when you are trying to flick around between dozens of comment threads. The other issue is, when I am posting, sometimes it becomes buggy when it comes to attaching flair to meet a subreddits' posting requirements. Eg: Flair options don't always show, so the post button remains grey.",1
"I honestly think that this is one of the most social app I've ever seen without even knowing who you're interacting with, a great app for an introvert like me indeed. BUT the only thing that bothers me so much is that you can't delete the notifications from inbox, you can only just stop them from coming more but not delete the existing one which is so infuriating and for that and that only i have given this 3 stars bc this is just ridiculous. Please consider bringing that option. Thank you",1
"The new update is worst. If you search any keyword you cannot view only videos. It will go through images, articles too if any. Please make the comment section as before because as of now it is very annoying.",1
"Has become worse over time. While I do enjoy the content of the subreddits I follow very much, I've noticed lately there's more algorithms at play to suggest new content to me. This was exactly why I left all other social media platforms, algorithms are a poison, and I prefer to just be fed the content I already know I want because otherwise I end up in more toxic environments. In addition to this the app itself is rather buggy with images never loading. All this to say I'm done with reddit",1
"Sometimes you get bad and good experiences. Mine have been mostly bad. Overall reddit CAN be useful, just the community sucks. Also, just because I checked out a subreddit once does not mean I want automatic updates. I get that you can turn the updates off, but they shouldn't be there in the FIRST PLACE.",1
"Current upgrade is not the greatest, as the swipe function swipes random pages instead of going down the list or the same group you were looking from. Also now i cant download anything by holding down and instead have to utilise the 3 dots on the corner, erasing the ease of usability",1
"As at 11.02.24:1. The notification numbers keep on increasing permanently: it went from 0 to 3 to 5. If I have 6 notifs, only one would be valid, the rest are previous notifs that have been chacked out already. This is very disruptive. 2. when you ask to see fewer stuff in suggestions, it USED to give you options between the types of post Or the subreddit itself. Now it just doesn't show you the sub at all; I preferred the previous way",1
"Can't comment on the some things, especially if it's to complain of the inconvenience of spotify deleting music after not being connected to wifi for an extended period of time. Very annoying if you're deployed to a 3rd world country and didn't find that they do that until you get there",1
"I've spent a lot of time on reddit and made the mistake of updating it earlier this month. Now I can't even share posts with friends because they can't open them. Also, if I go to another app to respond to a text etc, it puts me back at the very top of the post and I have to figure out where I am again. I wish there was a way to go back to before I updated, the glitches are just ridiculous at this point. I hadn't had any issues in years and now it's every day.",1
"Since first rating the android Reddit app in 2021, it's become nearly unbearable in the last couple of months. Continual issues: won't load, videos don't play, images won't show. The content is great, but the functionality is bad. Dropping the rating from 5 to 3.",1
It's a great app to browse around. But to try to post anything in any of the communities (that I tried) is an unbelievably complicated ritual riddled with rules and regulations. I'm all for rules an keeping things right. But WOW!! You can't post anything for sale until you've been on the roster for 90 days. Unless I'm reading things wrong.,1
It works but the fact you can't open any links in a real browser and in an app is ridiculous (why do I have to watch YouTube ads when I have a premium account?). Android should make it a rule that's it's forbidden to restrict content to an internal browser and not let have the option to use the one we want. It might actually break privacy laws such as GDPR since there is no control on the internal one.,1
"I don't mind the new updates and gesture system, although the change isn't ideal, because you can't pass carousel posts that have multiple images before going through all images, but the issue is that Reddit has become much slower",1
"Editing my review because videos and trying to open them basically freeze the app every time. Ever since the last update, it's been basically useless for trying to watch a video. Another edit: Still have issues loading some videos.",1
Really like the content but the UI is awful. The design really utilizes the most unreachable parts of my phone screen. The poc UI is actually a factor in limiting my screen time on an app that would otherwise be consuming my entire day,1
"Standard modern tech hellscape where the app is okay and the website is awful to push people towards the app because they can legally stalk you more and also use push notifications to try and get your engagement up. They also changed their API ToS to kill all the superior third party apps. They purposely make it very difficult to download and share content without Reddit watermarks and so on. But, if you plan on actively using Reddit, it's unfortunately still a must-have.",1
"I'm still new so I only gave 3 stars, until I get used to it more. I will say the post karma needs to amount quicker not just the comment karma, it makes it hard to make posts and gain karma as slow as it is. Also when loading a single picture it takes ages, speed up the process please, it's quite annoying and not everyone has unlimited data and hours to wait on a single post.",1
"The new update for videos is horrendous. It looks horrid and is confusing for some people, like me, because gestures are difficult to remember. Bring back all the buttons, please",1
"Reddit is awesome, but something is terribly wrong images are taking forever to load my device is fairly powerful and i have superb connection and app is updated. I have been facing this issue from a long time now.",1
"As much as I have enjoyed reddit, they have broken the mute function for users. No where could I find out how to report the issue. So now I get constantly bombarded with posts from the same communities I have already muted. And ro make things worse, when I mute some topic, subject or type of post, I am then bombarded with similar posts with the message that I have shown interest in that subject. The only interest I had shown was that I did not want to see that type of post.",1
"I get adds are needed but 3 stars for annoying ""discover channels"" in chat section, keep going to look at new message and then... nothing. Actually considering another platform, adds are too much!!",1
Great for the channel I am on. But I have been banned from so many for reasons unknown or reasons that are made up. It is fine to look but I like to correspond with others but Reddit is not as friendly as they should be. Reddit needs to oversee the administrators who block people because it makes them feel good.,1
"The app seems difficult to upload photos in a quick and easy process. I may not understand how this works, but it looks like you have to post images on another app, then link back on Reddit. Seriously?",1
"Votes broken, viewing my post in a browser shows 477 upvotes but when I view it on the app it shows 3. The notifications (2 different notifications for the vote count on the same post?) have different numbers too (2 votes and 250), it is so broken.",1
I actually really enjoyed the ability to swipe right to view other related posts and swipe up to view comments but it appears they removed that feature after adding it only like 3 weeks ago max other than that I dig reddit id say it still need some ways to make viewing posts when you search on mobile easier but overall its a solid app and social service,1
"Good app could be great. I would like the ability to block more accounts could you increase the limit from 2000 to 10,000 because I'm already at my limit. Oh and make it so I can create custom saved post in nameable slots such as funny cat videos or songs. Like that",1
"app is nic ebut update ruined it virtical shift for short video was nice, now that shift is made horizontal if there is a post with multiple image in it i need to scorll through every imge before shifting to next post/video.",1
"Pretty decent platform , pick a subject and talk about it and/or add to someone else's comments. Does what it says on the tin. Could be little bit simpler to implement and create but overall not too bad .",1
"Latest update broke the scrolling. When watching one clip it plays the audio from the clip below, even though the clip is not on screen.",1
"Load failure sometimes can be annoying, but 90% of the app is pure goodness. Edit: The app is getting more and more errors now. It doesn't load any content completely half of the time.",1
"I think they fixed the worst of the bugs that were lingering when the 3rd-party apps were killed off. The excessive ads are annoying, but I can live with it.",1
The new update is messy. The screen freezes every time I scroll and have to wait a few seconds for it to move again at which point it starts all over again. After 5-10 minutes of this the app crashes.,1
"Can you fix a bug? I'm currently not able to send messages. They show to be sending but when I back out and go back into the message it's not there. And it keeps alerting me of an unread chat but I've looked at everything and I haven't missed a chat. Also I already cleaned my cache, Uninstalled and redownloaded",1
"So in my pixel phone, the app used to me smooth but in past 6 months, it feels like laggy and its stutter sometimes while scrolling and media loading time is much slower than other platform. I hope reddit team is working on it and soon they will fix it.",1
"I'm only able to post images sometimes, I post images on the same subreddit, and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, I'm confused and annoyed, I have enough karma, it just tells me something went wrong",1
"It's middling. The reloading is really annoying because you might lose your thread, but the app is generally functional. I still find myself using browser on PC as my primary with Android as a backup.",1
"It's good, but it's full of ads. My homepage is full if ads. Sometimes I have to scroll through three or four suggestions to see something from a community I follow. But other than that it's great",1
"I absolutely love using this app. But sometimes the app shows that ""We havebsome trouble finding in reddit"" (no trouble in my internet connection). This was happening for past two months. Kindly check these and change it in the new update.",1
It okay on a high end phone I am using Samsung s series but it is abysmal on mid to low end devices like when I was using a Huawei mid range phone it was sluggish and had some issues here and there so it needs better optimisation in my opinion. That's y the three stars,1
"Need help! Description: Whenever I get a notification of comment replies, and I click on them, those discussion comments won't load, like they used to before. But if I open that post going to the sub where it was posted or save the post and open it later, it'll. But I'll have to search for that specific comment amongst 100s of others. Device model: RealMe 5s OS version: Android 10",1
"Been a reddit user for years and have been plenty happy with it except as of late, the app refuses to let me respond to comments on my phone. My laptop works fine but something wrong with the app and trying to respond to comments basically gives me a blue wheel of death but with reddit; I've reinstalled it thrice now and nothing",1
"Reddit has been solid for me for many years. Over the last week or so I'm unable to open my profile and make any changes or look back at my comments ect / it simply shows retry or something similar... Is there a fix? And without going through all the reviews, I haven't seen this issue mentioned, however perhaps it has",1
"I've lost track of the amount of times I've received a push notification for a community I've already told the app to hide. Sometimes I'll hit ""hide community"" on notifications for the same community upwards of three times a day, and this happens with enough communities that I can't even count them. It's really annoying.",1
"The UI looks a decade old. Messages won't work sometimes, you get weird bugs. The chat interface looks very old. You need to modernise the app, dear devs.",1
"I'm trying to write part two of a writing prompt that I wrote a few days ago. When I am going to post an updated version of it a message pops up every time saying "" Empty response from viewpoint. "" I've made another account and I have no idea how to fix this. All I want is to be able to post the next chapter.",1
"Keep getting notified from a group I'm not part of. Even without being logged. Did ignore, mute with zero effect. Can't keep the app installed when receiving non wanted updates constantly.",1
Do not waste your money on a Nokia even with a sound boosting app youeAr still can't listen to videos or music. And when you are trying to have a conversation on the phone either they can't hear you or you can'tthat hear well enough. It's a shame that my phone company representative said that I should purchase the Nokia instead of the Samsung as the Nokia cost was lower. Don't listen to anyone that says that you should be happy with aNokia because you will be disappointed with the device,1
"I do like Reddit for the most part. The issue I have is security. Being hacked is seriously annoying. I got a new phone, copied everything properly, but when I tried to get into reddit, it loaded my old HACKED account. Now I can't log out of this one. If it was only one time, that's not a big deal. People need to get a life and stop hacking everyone, simply to be annoying. Everyone I know seems to get hacked. So I'm uninstalling and trying to sort it out..again.",1
"this actually sucks i cant even log into my account or make a new one, it keeps saying ""sorry we cant log you in"" or it keeps making me wait 9 minutes this has been happening for a day now, ive literally uninstalled it aswell and installed it again. fix this.",1
"When I click on email links, they just take me to the home page. I have to close the app and click the link again like 2-5 times before it actually takes me to the post. It's pretty annoying.",1
It's freaking addictive I swear I have the hardest time putting my phone down once I open up reddit. I love the answers I get from the group forums everyone is helpful and considerate and honestly very knowledgeable.,1
"Lots of Bugs since most recent update (today's date 3/6/24). Keep getting error message, ""we had some trouble getting to reddit"" funny because my origin is reddit when i click a view profile link.",1
"I'm sure it's mostly fine if it ever works, but currently mine won't even get past the loading screen. I just see the logo until it times out.",1
"I love this app generally; however, recently I have come across a glitch: when I try to comment with an added image, it disappears and turns into an asterisk... frustrating",1
"Sometimes hard to follow conversations. But, at least it's all honest, instead of over sanitized the way some platforms have become.",1
"A while ago I left several subreddits I wasn't interested in anymore. After I updated the app I had to leave the same subreddits again, which were quite a lot. Really irritating.",1
"I used to love this app and I still do love the content, but I have to update it every five minutes and it's down every other damn day. They really need to work on it.",1
"Tbh this app isn't as great as the old 3rd party apps, and the new gesture controls could be implemented better or user customizable.",1
"The app's quality is dropping mainly because of all the new annowing subreddits like woosh.. Also not the best place to communicate with smart people nowadays.. What a shame, it used to be good.",1
New gestures suck. Y'all do realise that the swipe from the side is the default gesture for backing out of screens right?,1
"Good but Relay had better features. If you are going to shut down third-party apps, at least provide comparable quality!",1
It's good. I would like it if you could allow the user to add photos and videos to our replies to the subject. Others ask for photos in replies in a thread. We don't have that option. Thank you.,1
"The ""show fewer posts like this"" followed by ""posts from (insert community)"" function not working, it keep show ""oops something wrong. We are looking into it"" As it still show posts from that community next time i use it. Its been weeks.",1
"The App itself is good, although the Subscribers/Redditors are most of the time misleading. Why are the same images of a person continually repeated on their SuB?",1
"I Literally cannot use this app, i cant write, open anything, and after i cleared all cache and data, I cant even login without it freezing and crashing. Horrible experience, but already expected from reddit mobile.",1
I am just a beginner using this reddit. I love how it goes well and I will observe all the functions for better use in future. Overall there is nothing wrong with it yet. I hope I can get a lot of feedback from my question in the community.,1
"Pictures/videos just appear blank, definitely an app issue. No sound as well.",1
"It's ok. I installed it only because so many of my search results were Reddit threads and I wanted to read them. I'm still new to the app, but so far I am struggling to find what I'm looking for while using the search tool. Seems a bit sloppy and could be more user friendly.",1
The app orientation is not convenient for tablet/pad user. It can only be used in portrait mode and won't rotate to landscape.,1
"Fix the problem with your app forcing tablet users to use portrait mode only. Hello developers, it's 2024!!!",1
"You can't really expect much since it's a social media app, so the real power is in the community, and let's face it; if you're joining reddit you 100% know what you're getting into. I do have to advise, this is an app you should only use on WiFi, because oh boy does it go through data fast. Even when not using it. Highly suggest turning background data for it off, just so you don't run out of data. But yes it did work as stated. Not minor friendly though.",1
"How have you guys not fixed this yet? If I press play on media within the Reddit app, it should stop all my other apps from playing media AKA like Spotify.",1
"It's a Reddit app, great. This reminder to add a review won't go away till I do this I guess...",1
Stupid new UI changes for no reason,1
Slow on my S24 ultra,1
good really,1
"Reddit is great, but they keep pushing rage bait into my feed via ""you may be interested in this."" I keep telling it to show fewer posts like this, but it just finds new rage bait. I want to be on reddit for the things I'm interested in, not arguments that people are having with their neighbors.",1
"The app is alright. The interface and use is comfortable, however, there's a known problem with mods & general political leaning that causes the rules of the app & website to be enforced unevenly. I hope things change in the future, but overall do enjoy the experience 🙏🏼",1
Don't fix what ain't broken reddit.,1
Cant login in into the app,1
It's......ok,1
Bouch bit bind buaghtch,1
Whenever I open the comments of a video I saw the comments of a post a saw three or four scrolls ago.,1
"When I click on email links, they just take me to the home page. I have to close the app and click the link again like 2-5 times before it actually takes me to the post. It's pretty annoying.",1
Sound doesn't work and idk why,1
It's cool & informative,1
The way the replies to comments and the threads are set up is difficult to tell who said what when. The format is just weird and a bit confusing. It would also be better to give more suggested content. I feel like I get the exact same thing on my front page every day. It's also pretty difficult to go through your bookmarked posts and look for a post from a couple years ago. They should have like a filter system in the bookmarks for your profile,1
"I'm only able to post images sometimes, I post images on the same subreddit, and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, I'm confused and annoyed, I have enough karma, it just tells me something went wrong",1
"I can only give it 3 stars, for my first 2 minutes in her. I could feel the clarity, and the sound in the silence, made me know right away, I was in a different place now. Had I spent hours exploring, and discovering, I might have found it in five star exceptional 🇺🇸⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",1
Nije najs,1
"Mediocre. Reddit has been not great recently because of these reasons: - it bugs out constantly - it shows subreddits I already said I don't wanna see - Empty response from Endpoint. What does that even mean? Overall, needs a lot of work. 3 stars, mediocre. Fix it, or I'll switch more to DeviantArt.",1
New update broke reddit and I can't get in,1
"I get adds are needed but 3 stars for annoying ""discover channels"" in chat section, keep going to look at new message and then... nothing. Actually considering another platform, adds are too much!!",1
Viewing notifications hasn't been working for awhile now.....,1
Gives notifications in app when there's no new notification.,1
First time using app. We'll see how it goes .,1
not bad it's OK👍🏻 {Ha_Ne_En},1
I am just a beginner using this reddit. I love how it goes well and I will observe all the functions for better use in future. Overall there is nothing wrong with it yet. I hope I can get a lot of feedback from my question in the community.,1
Deleted TikTok account this will work,1
Hard to work with. Newby,1
Not enjoying the latest update.,1
Today I un-installed and deleted my account after seeing the third video in as many days of someone dying. If that's where social media is going I'll just get off here. Maybe giving everyone an equal voice was a dumb idea after all.,1
"Works well, active groups but the leftist bias is amazing.",1
Muted communities are still showing up in feed. The mute button is totally useless.,1
Meh,1
Please bring back the ability to sort by all subreddits from the homepage! It makes exploring Reddit much more efficient and enjoyable,1
good social media. But loading time waste my time,1
"Better than discord. But improvements are needed. ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ App interface in south Indian dravidian languages, pls. ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️. Keep updating pls. Android tv app pls. Inbuilt Google translations pls.",1
Issues after about half a hour with following and joining groups or subs,1
"The App itself is good, although the Subscribers/Redditors are most of the time misleading. Why are the same images of a person continually repeated on their SuB?",1
Nice,1
"Does ok to access reddit but would like the option to open more than one window at once. Also, quite a number of small irritations like losing the thread I was reading after a while and going back to a home page or whatever it goes to.",1
Good app,1
A bit cumbersome and limited with having to join groups to comment. Could definitely benefit from improvement,1
"I enjoy the app and think that there are some great communities and people on reddit, but there is a side of reddit communities that make me cringe and yell for common sense. Some moderators on some R/ community's boards are straight terrible/selfish/biased people, which isn't a reddit story fault its the moderator and the higher ups fault for not removing them I think that some communities make it confusing what you can post and what you can't post. Reddit is **IGHT** not the best & not worst",1
"If you like the free exchange of ideas, it's not bad. Until you discover that the little mods are like imaginary dictators and frequently remove post for no reason other than they disagree.",1
Great for the channel I am on. But I have been banned from so many for reasons unknown or reasons that are made up. It is fine to look but I like to correspond with others but Reddit is not as friendly as they should be. Reddit needs to oversee the administrators who block people because it makes them feel good.,1
I have IQ of 145 when I'm calm it goes too 200.,1
"Enjoying the app so far, a little bit glitchy, but when you refresh, it solves the problem. It's also recommended to download Imgur as a companion app to Reddit, so you can put links to your photographs to the platform (because if you use links from Instagram for your photos, it might not work).",1
Umm just wait till you go to the dark side of reddit,1
My brother got me permabanned.,1
"Such an empty space ""error""",1
It is what it say's on the tin. Saves me a lot of searching.,1
"app is nic ebut update ruined it virtical shift for short video was nice, now that shift is made horizontal if there is a post with multiple image in it i need to scorll through every imge before shifting to next post/video.",1
God awful app. Many others are far bwtter,1
"Votes broken, viewing my post in a browser shows 477 upvotes but when I view it on the app it shows 3. The notifications (2 different notifications for the vote count on the same post?) have different numbers too (2 votes and 250), it is so broken.",1
For some reason a few days ago I lost half my communities and not a single one showed up on my home page. Three and a half years gone.,1
"I enjoy Reddit quite a bit, lots of interesting topics for discussion. Plenty of valuable info here if you know how to weed out the trolls. One star off for its draconian ban policies. Way too strict, greatly stifles the ability to converse freely, this is a big turnoff. One star off for taking Awards away without any long-rumored replacement.",1
Have some Reallly usefull reditts as long as ypu don't go to the wrong community you will enjoyet,1
Needs to be re-vamped,1
Idk why you can't change flairs personalized in the app but fox please trying to update and see it that helps,1
It's reddit idk man 🤷,1
Its a great time killer.,1
"The app seems difficult to upload photos in a quick and easy process. I may not understand how this works, but it looks like you have to post images on another app, then link back on Reddit. Seriously?",1
Ok,1
"Would be four stars if I could actually swipe through a set of images without changing to popular accidentally. Also, it consistently 'Cannot reach Reddit. Try again?'",1
"Downgraded original 3* review since the video player has become even more wonky, and they removed the ability to sort your feed by recent, hot, etc. It's annoying to have to go into Settings to sort, while individual subreddits still allow for sorting from the menu bar. I hope this ""feature"" is reverted soon. (General navigation still sucks, but I had gotten used to it.)",1
Just a bit too many ridiculous adverts but apart from that great 👍🏻,1
Great,1
"I like the swipe up to see comments on the video I watched on the previous update, but now it's removed with the latest update. So many ads too so bummer / 5",1
"Love the app for the most part, but i say that as someone that just scrolls and usually doesn't engage. However, lately I can't open long image captions. I push more and just get the comments. Really frustrating, even after the update.",1
Good app but still not a patch on bacon reader which was awesome.,1
Sweet for chatting 100%,1
It's fine. Wish Apollo still worked.,1
Good app overall. Only downside is they recently started suggesting subreddits to me that are very relevant to where I live despite not having access to location nor have I ever shared that info on reddit. So that's pretty suspicious. Data mining...,1
I don't have enough experience to rate intelligentally,1
"this actually sucks i cant even log into my account or make a new one, it keeps saying ""sorry we cant log you in"" or it keeps making me wait 9 minutes this has been happening for a day now, ive literally uninstalled it aswell and installed it again. fix this.",1
they forced my account into testing the new ui without any way for me to opt out and new ui is bad,1
"It's a great platform supposedly, just ridden with lots of annoying bugs. One of them is when you try to upload an image as a comment and it turns into an asterisk. You have to try again and again in order to be successful and it's getting super frustrating that you end up not engaging at all.",1
"It's a good app, but I prefer Reddit is Fun app. Also, as a whole, the moderators are way too ban happy. For example if you like true crime and you say a child murderer deserves to die, they lifetime ban you. I guess they favor people who murder kids?",1
"Tbh this app isn't as great as the old 3rd party apps, and the new gesture controls could be implemented better or user customizable.",1
"Please marginalize the fascists, trumplicans and conservatives so their poisonous and reactionary positions can stop being normalized. Force them to go to the cheeto supporter platforms.",1
"Its buggy, message sometimes does update. Sorting of the latest message messed up.",1
I am not fond of the design and functions of the most recent update.,1
Breaks often and doesn't load,1
I like Reddit but this app is a mess.,1
"Reddit, your moderation sucks. I recently got a one week ban because of roleplay. How does talking as a fictional character translate to actually threatening something.",1
Would be better without adds ( and without cost a fortune to remove them F ),1
I like it 👍,1
"This app is okay, but this is existing in 90's it doesn't have any trending features",1
"App is solid but..... Really needs a feature added. An ability to make viewable offline. Not everyone has access to reception or wifi all the time.. Go to wifi or phone signal, save offline whatever you want and it will be available when you no longer have connection. Will make this app nearly perfect.",1
"A while ago I left several subreddits I wasn't interested in anymore. After I updated the app I had to leave the same subreddits again, which were quite a lot. Really irritating.",1
Wonderful,1
I actually really enjoyed the ability to swipe right to view other related posts and swipe up to view comments but it appears they removed that feature after adding it only like 3 weeks ago max other than that I dig reddit id say it still need some ways to make viewing posts when you search on mobile easier but overall its a solid app and social service,1
It can be a great place to go deep into an internet rabbit hole. But recently I haven't been able to sync my Reddit account to my phone or tablet. It doesn't even allow me to turn sync on and this is annoying. PLEASE fix; the typical stuff like clearing cache hasn't helped at all.,1
"Hello, could you please improve the loading time of pictures and stuff? It's a hassle to be constantly faced with similar issues while scrolling on reddit. When compared to other app, it doesn't happen to them as much as it's a problem of this app.",1
"Heeeyy the new update didn't work, I can't post anywhere without an ""endpoint error""",1
"I like using the app, but bugs and issues appear frequently. It's getting annoying.",1
It's freaking addictive I swear I have the hardest time putting my phone down once I open up reddit. I love the answers I get from the group forums everyone is helpful and considerate and honestly very knowledgeable.,1
"I can't change my username it says ""Unknown error"" everytime please fix it it's frustrating",1
I really didn't want to use the app but I installed it as Reddit is becoming browser-unfriendly on my phone.,1
The app is so frustrating. My homepage has been stuck for days. It happens at least 4 times a week and none of the usual tricks fix it. I'm thinking of permanently deleting the app and switching back to other more reliable social media. Would definitely not recommend.,1
"It's Reddit, what can I say.",1
"Good app could be great. I would like the ability to block more accounts could you increase the limit from 2000 to 10,000 because I'm already at my limit. Oh and make it so I can create custom saved post in nameable slots such as funny cat videos or songs. Like that",1
"Pictures/videos just appear blank, definitely an app issue. No sound as well.",1
In the last 2 weeks this app has gone from tolerable to unusable. So many issues going on when submitting comments. I'll never forgive you for killing sync and it's lucky I'm even bothered to carry on.,1
I can't post in the r/notinteresting 😕🤦‍♂️,1
Image quality has fallen a lot since the update,1
App is good but it can be optimisable low end device.,1
Post edits not saving.,1
Its ok. Lots of opinions that I dont agree with.,1
"I changed my review because some communities haven't been updating and the new tab wasn't working recently. It's not a bad app though, all things considered.",1
Just got it,1
"The app itself is fine, but there needs to be a more explanatory introduction to the app. On my first post, i got several negative comments telling me i was in the wrong subreddit. When you first open the app, there should be a tutorial or something telling you how the app works. Tbh, those comments were kinda upsetting and I've since deleted the app.",1
Not bad🤗🤗,1
Bad,1
"Ads and bugs, bugs and ads.",1
"Usable. I mostly use it for the chat function to get notifications on my phone, but sometimes the messages are out of order. Annoying when it happens.",1
"Great app, very welcoming and and accepting!!!!",1
"I'm sure it's mostly fine if it ever works, but currently mine won't even get past the loading screen. I just see the logo until it times out.",1
Yaha to vo sab bi ata ha bhai ab yo chrom pe jane ki lod ni ha,1
"C'mon, App is so buggy and slow. Just rebuild the damn app, give up on this mess!!!",1
Cool info but I still can't post after a few years of usage. 😕,1
Hard 2 Get Jonny Melton 2 Respond 2 Me so I've been Suppressing my Depression Over this since @1982...@stephaniedk13. Yes MELTON U really need to Clear This Up🥳🖤❤️🕳️🤙🛀,1
Can we have filter to sort GIF and videos?,1
"How have you guys not fixed this yet? If I press play on media within the Reddit app, it should stop all my other apps from playing media AKA like Spotify.",1
Worst rules ever I got banned for arguing with someone but not those who involved Even if I violated your rule 1 please unban me and give another chance because you should've warned me once instead of permanently banning me as you see I don't know much about the rules so please unban my account and give one last chance,1
Nice,1
"Love the community, the software could be better",1
Good,1
Idk what to say it kinda good,1
"I used to love this app and I still do love the content, but I have to update it every five minutes and it's down every other damn day. They really need to work on it.",1
Amazing 👍👍💋,1
Why can't I upload videos anymore... I've had this issue for over a year now.,1
I want option to save my accounts in games like Pubg Mobile & Farlight 84 with Reddit. You should add more Trends to the vertical list.,1
Meh,1
"I love this app generally; however, recently I have come across a glitch: when I try to comment with an added image, it disappears and turns into an asterisk... frustrating",1
Videos dont scroll smoothly on watch tab,1
Interesting topics and feedback,1
Nice using reddit,1
I can't login.,1
"I do like Reddit for the most part. The issue I have is security. Being hacked is seriously annoying. I got a new phone, copied everything properly, but when I tried to get into reddit, it loaded my old HACKED account. Now I can't log out of this one. If it was only one time, that's not a big deal. People need to get a life and stop hacking everyone, simply to be annoying. Everyone I know seems to get hacked. So I'm uninstalling and trying to sort it out..again.",1
"Sometimes hard to follow conversations. But, at least it's all honest, instead of over sanitized the way some platforms have become.",1
The UI is just garbage now,1
"Can't change profile picture, keeps saying unable to upload photo. Same with the banner photo it says unable to upload.",1
Can't scroll on a certain type of post continuously without going back and selecting another item again,1
This is a good app but how can you delet a single post from our history without deleting all .or add a option where we have to delet all hidden post,1
Do not waste your money on a Nokia even with a sound boosting app youeAr still can't listen to videos or music. And when you are trying to have a conversation on the phone either they can't hear you or you can'tthat hear well enough. It's a shame that my phone company representative said that I should purchase the Nokia instead of the Samsung as the Nokia cost was lower. Don't listen to anyone that says that you should be happy with aNokia because you will be disappointed with the device,1
New update made it laggy,1
It works I guess.,1
There were many issues. The primary for me was scrolling. That's fixed now. Would like more optimization and lower quality option for mobile data. Jitters in comment scrolling is still present. Watch section is jittery. Need to swipe twice to scroll next video.,1
Awesome,1
Takes way to long to load videos and images.,1
Too strick for no reason but still one of the best social platforms in the world,1
Perfect for memes,1
Pretty funny,1
Good,1
"Well, they finally fixed the app. Took a month somehow but it works. Im keeping the review low until i can verify they can keep the app running for more than a month",1
It's alright. No dramas yet,1
"Compared to Sync, this doesn't deserve 5 stars",1
Don't get me wrong its a good app but it has one bug I hate. Sometimes when I go on reddit it say an error has occured. So I uninstall the app but then when I try to log back in it says unable to authinticate so I to wait then it will work. So far it hasn't done that but pls fix.,1
Improve the speed and quality of this app,1
"Fix the problem with your app forcing tablet users to use portrait mode only. Hello developers, it's 2024!!!",1
Need features to read old threads,1
Good to socialize however I've been dealing with sam bug on my profile for a while now and still waiting for a response to a possible fix.,1
Its reddit but very slow...,1
NYC app always give ture and geniue option,1
"Good but Relay had better features. If you are going to shut down third-party apps, at least provide comparable quality!",1
Swiping on Reddit be like. Hey you wanna browse this subreddits videos about cats? Well after 3 swipes you are suddenly watching a video totally irrelevant to what you were watching.... Have fun! Fix this please,1
Doesn't open in app works,1
"The new update is worst. If you search any keyword you cannot view only videos. It will go through images, articles too if any. Please make the comment section as before because as of now it is very annoying.",1
Ttyu,1
"Latest update broke the scrolling. When watching one clip it plays the audio from the clip below, even though the clip is not on screen.",1
New gestures suck. Y'all do realise that the swipe from the side is the default gesture for backing out of screens right?,1
Good app to explore different things. But the problem is I get mail when someone direct messages me (that's great but) when I select view mail\message on Gmail It doesn't take me to message it just takes me to the home screen of the app.,1
"Other than having too many bleeding heart Dems, that's pretty good.",1
Uninstalled when it wouldn't let me customise notifications without creating an account. Lasted about a week before that abuse of phone facilities.,1
Can't private message videos or gifs. You should add the feature to be able to.,1
"It's not total garbage but pretty much sucks compared to the many 3rd party apps they killed. Unfortunately it's also mandatory if you want to see anything tagged NSFW so you might as well install it. Among the things most lacking is the ability to format contents. You have to use markup for everything links. It also likes to collapse comments when you have your finger on the screen slowly scrolling or when tapping links. In other words, it fails at what is essentially the heart of Reddit.",1
Tends to crash during peak usage,1
Nice app,1
"2 things it needs to improve on: 1. You should be able to delete a message in your inbox and not only mute, hide or block. Right now, evey chat I hide is in my inbox and can't get rid of them 2. If you block someone everything should be removed. No explanation needed.",1
"I've been using reddit regularly for the past 7 years. It's the only form of social media I regularly use. App is great but my only gripe is the lack of options and activity on Reddit chat. I'm disappointed there. Update: October 30, 2023. Chats have ceased to stop working for a bit. Chatting feature continues to have issues and seems to be worsening. Gonna have to dock a star down to 3 Update: I keep getting told to rate the app even though I already have. Still 3 stars...",1
Variable and. Very interesting.,1
The fonts are either too small or too big. I hope it can adapt to the system font.,1
Sometimes the article is just not well written or the grammar is atrocious,1
They keep giving me notif even after review. Annoying.,1
When I try to swipe photos it swipes from Home to Popular. Please fix.,1
Has great content and topics and you can find hidden info and details,1
You know damn well why I'm here,1
"Some boards are balanced, but you have far to many kids as mods, banning people for being a member if other /r boards, it's THAT childish. Reddit needs to hold these powermad moderators to a bare minimum standard whilst enabling features to allow users to escalate an issue above these lunatics. Echo chamber & group think is only welcome.",1
"Pretty decent platform , pick a subject and talk about it and/or add to someone else's comments. Does what it says on the tin. Could be little bit simpler to implement and create but overall not too bad .",1
"The app's quality is dropping mainly because of all the new annowing subreddits like woosh.. Also not the best place to communicate with smart people nowadays.. What a shame, it used to be good.",1
It's a great app that I often have issues with... things won't load or it just doesn't work,1
Eh. It's not the worst app but not the best.,1
Chat notification issue--unable to receive notifications in realtime,1
"Down arrow ""jump to next comment"" button no longer works. Well that pretty much makes it unusable for me",1
"Some of the new functions are unhandy. It takes more time to achieve the same thing as before, which I personally feel like a downgrade.",1
"Are there any available apartment homes available for move in?? Eager, loving and eager",1
It does everything I expect it to do so yeah.,1
Great App !! Need Some Changes Like Video Button ! Make Ui Better,1
"So far so good but I can't change my profile pic, whenever I try it say unable to upload image and it's also the same with the banner",1
"Nov '23, this app was riddled with bugs for just basic functionality. I gave the app a try again now, and after a few days I have to say it's a smoother experience than before. I haven't had any issues loading posts or content, the app hasn't randomly signed me out, and I can navigate the app without it freezing or crashing since I reinstalled. For basic browsing, the app now gets the job done, and I'm going to assume it's because there have been fixes over the past few months. Nice!",2
"I would give 5 stars but it's sometimes slow to load or images time out before they load, even when cell service is good or on high speed wifi. Also, if I click a shared link and choose to use the app it asks me to sign in or doesn't load properly. Aside from that, it's Reddit, so it's great. There are so many uses. You can find information and forum type support for a plethora of subjects and projects. When learning and research aren't your objective, there's plenty to keep you entertained.",2
"Current: after clearing all app data and restarting the app, it appears to be working as expected but with a slight performance hit (as opposed to how it was before this whole mess). I'm just glad it's fully functional again. Update: 5/3/19 update completely broke the app for me. Again. The next day it was back to the crazy long load times. Reset the app cache and it didn't help.",2
"One of my most used apps. However it bugs me that some features are inconsistent with the iOS version of the app. I can pinch-to-zoom to a huge degree on iOS but in the Android app (on a OnePlus 6T) the images will only allow a small zoom and on some posts, pinch-to-zoom doesn't work at all. What gives? Other than this minor gripe, the app works great.",2
"UPDATE: After getting a new phone, it seems to work now. Android 6 and older generally don't seem to function well, so if you have an older phone you may be SOL It used to work amazingly, minus the ability to adblock you get with the website, but for the last couple of weeks it has refused to load any content. I can get in and see that I have messages, but no subreddits will load, no posts will display, etc. I've reinstalled it and tried to find solutions to no avail. Oh well. (April 20th 2019)",2
"Still some features that haven't made it from the page to the app...it's frustrating that many account settings (some that impact viewing options) are administered on the webpage, yet control the app's behavior...opening Chrome to manage settings on the app is counterintuitive, and having to redo it after every app update in order to refresh them to the app is worse. That said, I'm sure this is all coming eventually, and what's there now is clean, usable, and reasonably bug-free.",2
"Great app, wonderful website. I've wasted more time on here than I care to admit. The android app has some shortfalls though compared to what I've experience on iOS. Since they added the ability to scroll through multiple photos within the same post, there seems to be a 25% chance that it freezes mid swipe, leaving you unable to go forwards or backwards through the album until you open and close the post again. Another issue with photos is sometimes zooming is weird or unavailable. Fix pls.",2
"Good, but could be a better experience. For instance, the comment editing feature has no rich text controls. There's a hyperlink maker, but it doesn't let you add a link to a text selection, you have to input both the link and the link text, severely limiting its utility, often you have to do double the work when you go back and add links to your comment. No bold or italic buttons. You have to use the website on a desktop computer if you want any of those ""modern"" features.",2
"Reddit video is buggy as hell. The player would random rotate the screen from landscape to portrait and vice versa, randomly mute and unmute, take forever to buffer/load, and for some reason would reload the video again if you go back a few seconds. Other than that I don't really know of any other issues that are worth mentioning and I personally use the app a lot and really love it.",2
"Hey, Reddit devs! You guys added a pretty neat feature that allows me to post multiple images at once and let's people slide through them. Great idea, but there's a hitch. The images are slightly zoomed in, so the text is usually cut off on the sides. You can't click and view them like the single photos. Please fix it soon! Videos still have problems, but it's actually not as bad as before so keep it up! Great work devs!",2
The reddit app is great. The only issue with it is there is no way to turn off trending notifications. Like randomly every 4 hours I get a trending notification from one of my subscribed subredddits. The only way to turn it off now is to turn off all notifications from reddit. Other than this one issue. It is a great app that is easy to browse and understand.,2
"It has its moments that the app sucks and is riddled with bugs, but generally I can waste so much time on this app that it doesn't matter. My biggest problem is that sometimes when I go to another app and come back my page goes all the way back to the top, which is frustrating after spending like an hour scrolling. Overall I'd still recommend it.",2
"Great app that is easy to use. However, there are issues with play videos and gifs often, whether because it's unintuitive or impossible to hear, etc. Also, when multiple images are within a post makes, the images no longer fit the resolution of the screen, which suuuuucks. Ultimately, it's pretty function and easy to use though.",2
"This is an awesome app. It's better than using the website. It has the option of you being able to go back and see your history of the threads you have visited. One feature I would like to see this app get though is being able to sync your history. Currently, it doesn't follow you from device to another device. If I log into the app on another device my history is gone. If I uninstall or clear the storage and cache then my history gets deleted. It should be saved and be able to sync it.",2
"Not as feature rich as the third party Reddit apps but very clean and we'll designed. Currently, images don't display well on the Pixel 3XL. When you full screen an image the top bar becomes white while the rest of the picture has a black background. I think this is an easy fix Reddit can make to improve the app experience on the Pixel 3XL.",2
"The is really good. Commenting and messaging is made really easy. The negatives I'd say are that you cant play videos properly. The app doesn't play sound and you can't use the seek bar for videos. The app also crashes every 15 minutes. **Update: 06/04/2020** 1. Still crashes every 10 minutes 2. Sound is still unavailable for every video with sound. 3. Can't seek in a video, pause etc. Every video plays like a .gif.",2
"So, most of the app works completely fine, and thats great, there's of course, random issues about pictures and videos not really loading, but, I guess that can't really always be avoided. The real issue I have is with a feature they promoted heavily, and now is part of my daily routine, the chat, its not comparable to any other messaging service, such as discord, whatsapp, etc. There is no way to send images, its slow, and on mobile it won't show new messages unless I reload the interface.",2
"I love using reddit. I really like the concept; a place where I go to see discussions or people's opinions about a range of topics or events that take place in the world. However, I am not a fan of my ""homepage"" layout or the notications page. I dont know what it is but it feels cluttered or not ""simple"" and minimal to my liking. Also, The ads and ""suggestions"" are extremely annoying. Nonetheless, I get a lot value from the app for what it provides me.",2
"I ***love*** it when I see a post I want to comment on, go to my homescreen or web browser to look something up for the comment, and switch back to Reddit only for it to reload and show me an entirely different set of posts on the screen. Then I can't find the post I was going to comment on. Super frustrating. Overall, super entertaining, addicting, amd frustrating.",2
I really like this app. I don't upload stories very often but spend more time reading stories. I really like how unlike the website I can have dark mode on so it makes it easier on the eyes to read. My biggest issues with the app is the constant pop-ups of most popular post which just looks like an old TV when you couldn't get a station. The only other thing I wish is that there was a way to remove adds without a monthly subscription. If it had one time payment to get rid of ads I would do it.,2
"I find this a very well created app. The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 Stars however is that certain settings can only be accessed if you use a browser-based connection and go to their websit for Reddit. While I can understand the reasons for doing that on their security level, I still find this very annoying. If this was done for a development decision, I just find this plain annoying.",2
"Mobile site is tedious and annoying, so finally switched to the app. App currently has no Message selection option with other users, even if clicking the 3 dots in the top-right of their profile. Only the chat option ever shows up anywhere. You have to go to your own profile and write out their full username in a draft message. Either make the full switch to the Chat feature, or leave the Message option be. 👍🏽",2
"Overall I think this app works very good, but there really needs to be an option for its communication to happen by Wifi only. An app like this that is non-essential for either the functioning of the phone or communication that truly is necessary, should have the option of it's communication being turned off so that it doesn't eat up the data allowance of a minimal data plan that someone has out of necessity for spending as little as possible on their cell phone service",2
"Great platform, but the app could use some improvement. Video loading is hit or miss at best, and it freezes or crashes relatively often. You would think with such a massive international user base these problems would be taken care of, but in the 2 years I've been a daily user I haven't seen any improvements. Quality content and smart user base makes it easy enough to overlook for me, though.",2
"Overall, good app. It makes Reddit streamlined to view on mobile. Only 2 minor issues: 1 - Sometimes if I click a link that opens to the Reddit app (such as Reddit emails to view a post) the app stays on the loading page. Best thing is to close the app and try again. 2 - To type a message to another Redditor, I can't see the text bubble as I type. I.e. the keyboard covers the text bubble when it comes up. So, I have to type, then stop to correct errors, before sending.",2
"Great app overall, good layout and organization, dark mode a huge plus. Major downside is the app does not overcome issues with device connectivity. This can force a user to need to restart the app, cycle airplane mode to refresh signal when not on wifi, and sometimes force a device restart to restore function. That major flaw aside, the app works splendidly and is a high performance time destroyer.",2
"Its really fun, but there's just one probably. Its with uploading pictures. It doesn't put the images in order of which they've been saved, it mixes then and it takes forever to find the picture you want to upload even if it's a resent picture. If you could please make it so the pictures are in order of how they were saved in your gallery, that'd be very much so appreciated, thank you :)",2
"Love reddit. Didn't give 5 stars because this bug where advertisement audio randomly keeps playing as you scroll from post to post. Kind of annoying, looks like it's been a problem for years but hasn't been fully fixed. Please if anyone with the ability to fix this is reading this, do whatever you can because it's verrry annoying. For the meantime I'm going to try out 3rd party reddit apps like Relay, to see if that fixes the problem.",2
"Only one pet peeve with the app so far, but it's a big one. I wish it would default to the app instead of via web browser when tapping on notifications. I see nowhere that I can change it in my app settings, and I've never told the app to do that. When it defaults to the browser, it always says ""This looks better in the app"" and then asks me to switch off the browser and into the app. However when I tap the ""see it in the app"" button, I get a forever loading screen in the app. 😢",2
"Had issues with app. I like the app, it works well, but 2 things. (1)streams on the feed, whether they auto play or not(live or static), they pause all audio on my device to put the stream audio on(even when it's muted). (2)I've had this issue with videos going full screen, freeze for 3 seconds and I'm not allowed to scroll comments until I back out and come back in. I managed to fix that by clearing cache & data for the app, then reinstall app. Please fix or add option to remove stream feeds.",2
"I love reddit but honestly the app is kinda meh. Ill give 4 stars though because its pretty easy to navigate and looks well designed. I do hate the fact that the app is over advertised, like a lot, and some of the websites features are covered up by the ads for it. Not to mention that you cant listen to sound from the app. You just cant. And its really annoying.",2
"A fun app with intuitive controls. Biggest feedback would be to rearrange some of the buttons. The back button on the android is right by the reddit inbox button, so I accidentally go into my mailbox a lot. The close button (x) is on the upper left corner of my phone, which is a far reach for my thumb. So I accidentally drop my phone a lot when I try to close a post.",2
"Updated Review due to recent decline of Reddit App overall: The app won't load or refresh randomly for well over 10 minutes, easily, each time it happens. Videos won't play a lot of the time, it's as if it's not actually a video but a screenshot of a video. If the video does actually work and allows me to press the play button, suddenly the sound won't work or allow me to press the sound button. I love Reddit but this app has been aggravating as hell lately! And yes, it's up to date.",2
being able to review my preferred categories on my phone is great. The app works well and has no problems but I don't understand why I can't save this app to my SD card. All these apps insist on being on your phone and it's making it pointless to have an SD card except for pictures and videos. stay ahead of the curve guys move to the SD card. the people like kindness and options.,2
"Not exactly easy to navigate, from a new-comer's perspective anyhow. At times, it's somewhat more complicated to use, then my mind feels like it's up to processing. Although at other times, there's such a vast wealth of interesting content within the app, one can find limitless hrs of joy if so chosen, whether seeking knowledge, opinions, tips and tricks, stories, resources, guides, content-specific-related chat, chat w/like-minded individuals, explanations, theories, debates, ideas, outcomes...",2
"The app does this thing i can only descibe as blinking. When i open the app it loads stuff and then goes blank and reloads it, and goes blank and repeats, It does this several times until i close the app. Even after reopening the app, it still does this. It also does something similar if you go fullscreen on a video, where it will close in and out of the video. Can you fix these bugs, they make it hard for me to enjoy using reddit.",2
"I love this app very much. My one problem is that when I try to switch off anonymous browsing, the app keeps me anonymous, and it's caused problems where I've tried to click on my notifications, it won't take me to the post, I'll lose the notification, and I'll be told that I've been switched back to my main account when I haven't. I can't log out, or view my messages or do anything that requires being logged in, so I've restored to uninstalling the app temporarily.",2
"Reddit is awesome, the app is awesome. The only problem I have is that many Android users (I'm on galaxy s8+) cannot upload videos. Whenever I try it gets stuck on submitting. No matter how long the video is it will sit there forever until I navigate somewhere else, then it starts over like it never tried to submit in the first place.",2
"I've been loving the app, but there's one major issue. I'm new, and mostly use it for trading on games like Dark Souls 3. Because my account is new, no one trusts me for trading, and I can't comment more than once in a 10 minute period, which is terrible for back to back messaging in a trade. Apart from that, the only problem is it recommending me subreddits I have no interest in, but that's not really a downside (idk if there's an option to turn it off, but it's easy to ignore). Great app!",2
"The app functions great. It's simple and mostly easy to understand. My one gripe right now is that I had to consult Google to figure out how find my posts that got lost in the feed, or the ones nobody responded to (Tap your profile pic in the top-left corner next to the search bar. tap history.). Also, if your very active, you'll find it tedious to sift through that history. It could be done way better. Otherwise, functions great and the notifications don't seem to get too intrusive. :)",2
Pretty cool app but a problem I noticed is that whenever tapping on a notification if you have 2 or more accounts and ur not logged into the one which you got the notification from it doesn't work. It just brings up ur main page for the account you have opened last and when you try to switch to another account it won't work. They seem to be fine if you have the app open when tapping on notifications tho.,2
"12/10/19: Custom user flair never save, when I open reddit and look at my user flair for a certain community, it goes back to the default. I would like to see this fixed soon. 1/8/20: When I upload a video, a notification shows up that says: ""Uploading file: [insert file's name here]"" I am unable to swipe away this notification and pressing cancel does nothing. The only option I'm left with is to restart my phone (Samsung Galaxy S10+) to make it go away.",2
"Also was having issues with the latest update, uninstall/ reinstall seems to have fixed it for now. Much quicker to load, too. Still, not addressing this issue despite many users complaining is enough to knock off a star. At least include that there's a known issue and how to fix it. I actually started using a couple unofficial apps for a few days before thinking to try it.",2
"Weeks later and still a broken mess. The newest update at least fixed the homepage loading issues and video loading, but that's about all. Thumbnails don't load, images don't load as well and there's also weird scrolling issues. Man what's going on over there guys? Did all of your experienced programmers quit or something? Edit: All of the prior issues have been rectified since the previous update.",2
"Definitely a better experience than trying to use the website on mobile. Not too happy with all the ads or the ""upgrade to premium!"" spam. Also, notifications are difficult to manage (each type of event showed up as a different stream on my phone). Not the app's fault, but as a new Reddit user, I was instantly met with hatred and derision when I attempted to have a rational discussion in a subreddit that, ironically, I agreed with. This led me to close my account and uninstall the app. YMMV.",2
"Pretty good app, the subreddit feature makes it trivially easy to find communities and self-promote. Sometimes the app can be weird in its layout, and the notifications that appear in my mail won't go away even if I clicked the notification outside of the app. Otherwise though, good themes and layout.",2
"Reddit is a good website and this app does a fairly decent job of getting you there. However, I have some complaints about the app's design, like how you can't press a button to go to a comment's parent or get context for it like you can on the website. I also don't like how, when you get mobile notifications of trending posts on your subreddits, it copies those notifications to your inbox. Also the app slows right down while viewing an image.",2
"I've recently began using Reddit to find memes and news, the app is pretty good for its purpose! However it's very laggy and the video quality makes them look like gifs, don't know if it's because I got an old crusty phone or the app is not properly optimized. This is the only app I have where this happens. Update: Well, I got a new phone and it works pretty well. Some options are not available on the mobile version and it's also hard to find the settings I want.",2
"It is the best social media platform that I have. One thing though that is super wrong. Whenever I look at an image, gif, or video sideways and swipe away to get out of the post, it causes my entire phone to freeze, and has to be restarted by holding the power button. PLEASE fix this, as it is really annoying having to restart my phone every time this happens.",2
"Right now, a reader. Not participating except once. I am blown away by other readers & writers. So freaking cool. What heads people have. So intelligent, funny, thoughtful.. The Apbyp is pretty easy to move around in. Plenty of nuances. Always a category to get excited about. Thought it was a basic political App, like heavy, dripping in the wrong place for me, but surprisingly it's intelligent, thought provoking & a teaching tool for me. I don't get on as I would like. I need time w/it.",2
"I really like reddit and its a good way to pass the time but recently when I have tried to get onto reddit it will not work. So troubleshooting, I uninstalled the app thinking I would just reinstall it but I keeps saying something went wrong. I have followed the given instructions to troubleshoot but none of those work. This is the only reason it does not get 5 stars.",2
"Long time mobile lurker here. Anyone else having a new problem where reddit freezes up? It happens when I am playing a video and click on comments while the video is playing. The video tries to go full screen then freezes with parts of the UI still up, but they don't respond when clicked/ tapped. The back arrow on Android is also unresponsive. Closing the task and reopening it lets me get back to scrolling my life away.",2
"For those who have the constant ""problems getting to reddit"" errors, try what I did, which worked when uninstall/reinstall alone didn't: clearing the cache partition, then reinstall. Google ""clear cache partition"" with your device name to probably find a short article or 90 second video about your device. I would still say in general that the app seems to load more slowly than other things on my phone, but Reddit is free and great and I love having a mobile version, so I can't complain too much",2
"The concept is amazing, the execution is amazing, the only issues I've ever had have been technical, specific to the app, and pretty minor. Example of a small issue I'm currently experiencing: When writing a long comment, if what your writing stretches from the top of the screen to where your on-screen keyboard is on your phone, you cannot scroll down, so you can't see what you're typing as you're typing Not a deal-breaker, just kind of annoying if you're long-winded like me 🤣",2
"Everyone can find something for them on reddit. Mods are hit and miss sometimes but overall pretty solid app as far as user friendly interface, ease of usability, simple clean design...would've given 5 stars but I despise its now ""pay to play"" in the sense that you must pay to unlock avatar outfits or even to be able to create your own username. Kinda lame.",2
After using it for only several hours I was able to get every where I needed to go. And enjoyed the constent tools and content that made it that much more easyier. I have gotten several apps were there is no direction or real help. But i did not have that problem. Dark mode is nice and smooth. As well as a huge selection of community pages. Get it!,2
"It is okay for text stuff but recent updates feel like the developers are trying to forcefully insert tik tok into it. The new video player is so cumbersome when trying to view the comments at the same time. Trying to go to a cross posted image post only shows the image file, and I have to specifically go to the crosspost before going to the original post. I feel like that change is just to show more traffic in statistics. All these changes make this app exhausting to use. Ads are fine though.",2
"I'm fairly new to Reddit. Mostly the app has been great. Only running into a couple of small issues. For instance, when a user uploads images along with their story, I'm unable to see any of the text, I can only see the images. The other issue is the reply, upvote & downvote buttons for specific comments at the bottom of all the threads are usually covered up by the ""add a comment"" (to the OP) box. Not sure if these issues are with the app or if it's with me but thought I would mention them.",2
"Use this daily, more so than the website. Works well, does what I need it to do. Only minor gripe is that when you tap the 3 dot menu icon on a post, the ""Hide post"" button is immediately below the ""Save"" button. I've accidentally hidden posts multiple times while trying to save them & it took me quite a while to navigate how to make them reappear. Other than that, I really dig the app.",2
"Good app, only issue is that you get at least one notification alert when you open the app but it's usually what's trending, it's not a message or reply (even though the icon is a envelope). Most apps give you a fake reply notice to get you to open the app and read the top story (I'm looking at you, LinkedIn).",2
"It's a good way of having a bonesy app that really features the more usable and satisfying components of the full website! I always turn to Reddit for the best in peer info and topics. Has a quirky problem that you may not be able to change your interests. Unfortunately, because of this my, feed is buggered with hokey topics. I am about to uninstall because I am no longer interested. Am Looki for a fix but thinking it is on its way down to a permanent Dev node that is not actively demand access.",2
"Overall, very good experience for users. Some ppl have valid complaints: some gifs/videos only load up once and therefore cannot be rewound; image galleries on posts are stretched to fit a space and sometimes that makes it difficult to read text (e.g. if someone posts a pic of tweets and you can't read them well enough bc some of the text is cropped out; sometimes volume doesn't work on certain videos and ppl attribute that to the app version of the site. If you can overlook, then great app!!!!",2
"Wonderful app. Glitches are chronic though. If I scroll for long enough the app flat out crashes, sometimes the app uninstalls itself? Somehow? The app still shows on my screen but I needed to reinstall it in order to use it. Sometimes a picture/gif/other media files don't load. Overall they're quite rare but still happen from time to time with no signs of a fix on the horizon. Would recommend",2
"Obviously Reddit is great, and overall I love the app. However it does have a few bugs that can get annoying and seem to have been going on for quite some time. For example when you open a notification for Reddit it opens an additional copy of the App instead of the one you already have open as an overlay, which tends to cause problems with making posts. Far too often I get a message saying something went wrong after I type out a long comment and click the post button. The fix for me is to go into multitask and close the additional Reddit windows. It's not a big deal but it definitely takes away from the experience.",2
"Reddit is a place I can really enjoy myself and talk to people I share interests with. The only things is I have slight problems when answering notifications. If I click on one it's no problem. But if I don't completely end the app before clicking another, it stays on that same post. Backing out of that post just backs me out of the app instead of sending me to the home screen.",2
"Good but have some issues! 1. The notification is too much irritating after download or save image or videos. It takes time to go. And it is also large which prevent to take next action. 2. Download, save, and subscribe button should be in front face not inside some three dots menu, like tikTok has. 3. Instead of three dot button long press on any video or image the menu would be convenient. These are my three remarks. Another thing video gets downloaded twice or thrice sometimes.",2
"Reddit became the more or less quick and relevant source of information compared to the Google's SEO pages. The information here has more value for me than any search engine. But search functionality itself is far from ideal on reddit. Also, the most annoying thing is that copying function is not permitted. It doesn't really stop from switching to other tools, you know. It just makes it more annoying",2
"Though made better, they took away the award system to monetize more money which a lot of people feel hurt the award system. You rarely see people even give awards now if not never. Maybe once a year. And that was when they gave you a free and people actually bought them because it reminded people. But they have improved the app in a lot of areas and made a few bad.",2
"Reddit is a rabbit hole of wholesome, and horrifying content, and it's easy to get lost there for hours at a time. It's a generally good place for me to post content, and receive attention from the relevant / appropriate community. My only peeves are: (1) phone notifications don't hide message content, and are glitchy sometimes. (2) choosing to hide messages makes them disappear, and not into a separate inbox that you can still access",2
"Only problem is when I miss pressing on the notification arrow and all Reddit notifications go away - if I pull up notification history and click ib a notification, it won't open with that message, but the one I already had open. Other apps are able to open their messages from the notification history.",2
"It's reddit on you phone. I don't use the computer site enough to know the differences I'm missing, but it is quick access and easy to use. The notifications need fixed though. I will constantly get notifications from groups I'm not apart of or following anymore.",2
"There's a lot to see and plenty of interesting topics to read. The members' responses range from insightful and informative to intentionally hilarious and entertaining. Occasionally, the app glitches but is something that is to be expected nowadays. Overall, it isn't terribly bad. Downvoting can really suck at times, but that's just human nature at play, albeit very petty at times.0",2
"A pretty good place to ask questions and get responses. Often, when I face a tech issue, want consumer advice, or need to know something about a topic, I ask the Reddit community in a specific group and it is usually helpful. When I can contribute, I try to do so in the same spirit of ""entraide"" (collaboration). Sometimes, I am a bit lost with the interface changes, though.",2
"I avoided downloading this app for years but finally downloaded it after using it without an account for damn near a decade and I now find myself using it more, especially to keep track with my favorite podcast family h3. I also like that it seems to be the only place on the Internet where if you can't find the answer you're looking for it just any answer at that on Google it any other search engine, someone on Reddit is bound it knows lol.",2
"Constantly freezes on launch especially from hyperlinks. Then when it doesn't freeze it does not open the requested area. Update +1 login freeze issue is fixed. Hyperlinks still do not open the sub, but they do open the application.",2
"People giving reddit bad reviews for not being vanilla enough, that's not what this site is about... Go back to Fb or Instagram. It's always been full of the obscure and out there topics, that's what makes it so good. Also a hive of excellent interest and research groups. The only reason why I give the app 4 stars is that it's laggy and freezes. I also used to like the live streams during covid, but they seem to have gone now.",2
"Easy to use, but here are couple improvements I'd like: 1) Allow older posts to be visible and easily accessible, so that the timeline integrity is maintained. 2) Allow for HD upload of files, so that video quality doesn't suffer.",2
New swipe right feature to see more posts is a terrible design decision when you have an album of photos you're swiping through. Unless you pay attention to the number in the top right when there are multiple photos you'll just end up swiping into new posts. Latest update plays audio from videos about 10 posts down. And sometimes it gets stuck on. Edit: they fixed it.,2
"Easy to use, never any glitches, you get to actually choose the subjects you are interested in with specified criteria along with rules and mods specific to that channel. The only drawback that I don't like is that there's a lot of Christian advertisements all the time. This has been since last Autumn. It's almost harassing at this point.",2
The app works quite well but Reddit login is the bane of my existence. It's overly 'secure' and is stressful to actually just simply login. I've never had such a hard time logging in ever. I love security but this isn't optimized. Note: never ever misplace your password (I use a PS manager and still have issues with this site).,2
"Great access to the community... Would only recommend the addition of a method for sending images in text... Which has now been implemented! However, there's also a very annoying Suggested Content feature that's relentless, unless and until you can find the obscure setting to disable it (it comes enabled by default, which is very annoying but understandable). For a long time I thought it was impossible to disable. I am now content with the app!",2
"Way better than Discord, but so often people go with default settings that don't let you post more than one pic or video to show a before and after type thing... And you can't edit the title once posted. Great community for looking topics up instead of trying to find DIscord invite links. Mostly in love but doggonit.",2
"I've used it to get help on any number of subjects including problems with my smartphone, cooking and DIY. I've also been able to help other people with their questions. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is that there is a bug in the app that keeps me from editing and updating a post that has a picture in it. That means I can't clarify a post based on comments received or even correct a spelling error.",2
"A short while ago, I used to be able to post my pixel art posts in the app. I've been posting some pixel arts for a while back then. But recently just now it says I can't upload my pixel art images because it says my image should be at least by 20 pixels. I don't understand why they have to add this inconvenience. I used to post many pixel art posts and I simply just can't because of this change. Please may you find this post and perform some adjustments to the app so I can enjoy it. Thank you",2
"grate over all but a few bugs. it's really frustrating that the unread message notification numbers wont go away when u dont have any messages left unread, especially if the sender deletes it before u can read it.",2
"I like that I can get a lot of information on problems I'm trying to solve and have many questions about! It's a good app when it's working correctly! I occasionally have issues with clicking on a reddit subject from Google search and having it link to the app...the specic subject I was searching for is nowhere to found when the app opens , the subject in my search inquiry fromGoogldoesn't match , I don't know if it's a problem with the communication of the app or Google search, or both ?🤔",2
"Over all based on how c we can engage in different communities of our interests, Reddit is the best and will be best, the app UI ( design) is full of information but just a little bit not used friendly, and as mentioned by other it's little bit sluggish but not too much. It can be improve. Worth using as for default social media app.",2
"I love almost everything about reddit. I do feel a little sad when I genuinely need outside opinion on personalized situations but I can't post yet because I don't have enough points. So I lose interest. Therefore, not logging in so much, therefore not earning points. It's really my problem, but if you're someone who needs to have that two way interaction right away. this can be aggravating. From now on, I'm going to make a genuine effort to learn how to use this app.",2
"Ace. Although, it would be better, I think if it could warn me before telling me, AFTER, I have made concerted efforts at quite a thoughtful reply to many posts posed, be so whatever the subject matters are, and then says take a timeout, for y number of minutes. Why, I wonder. Maybe trying to raise certs issues and root out bugs in the systems, which, possibly, could be at my end or areas of Reddit, which is ace, mostly.",2
"It's by far the best social app. Not perfect any means: specifically, the reliance on volunteer mods and lack of moderation consistency across Reddits are both positive and negative. But still it's much better--intelligent, courteous, substantive, informative--than any of the bigger social platforms. Especially Twitter/X, which was never great but is now trash.",2
"It's a good app full of fact checked resources on topics you are trying to research about. There are always people trying to help but also people on the opposite end that don't. My recommendation is if you choose to look up information about a topic, make sure there isnt misinformation that are precived to be true. Even when they're not. Just be careful and browse cautiously.",2
"I've had Reddit downloaded for a really long time, but just this past year, I've started using it regularly. I found it a bit overwhelming at first, but now I'm pretty comfortable navigating around the app. One of the things I like the most is that there isn't much censorship on Reddit. We have so many sensitive people these days that you can't post anything.. without it being taken down or cxled by someone. So it's nice to have an app with little censorship 😉, hoping it stays this way 👍🏻!!",2
"Pretty good Reddit viewer app. But it uses a smaller size of text than I specify I want all apps to use in the Android system settings, and the app doesn't let me set the size of the text I want within the app. So I have to use the website instead so the text isn't too small.",2
Honestly I've found it a good alternative to other shortform media platforms since if you click on a video you can scroll. The algorithm could be better but the advantage of it being hands-off (ie terrible) is you mainly get videos from subreddits you've joined.,2
"Bugs in direct message.The messages don't appear at first ,but it appears after some times which results in miscommunication So for example once conversation happens between us and I revisit back to the convos that happened a minute ago I find that there are messages that didn't appear at first galnce and I only see them after few seconds",2
"It's nota bad app. The adds aren't a problem, and I haven't had any really big issues. The only issues I've had are when some photos or videos don't load or start properly. Other than that it's a great app.",2
"Works great, pretty seamless UI. Only suggestion I have is to improve notifications. Even after I silence a sub reddit I stumbled upon I still get notifications from it and I don't see any settings for specific sub reddits. Just in general.",2
"I really like REDDIT. My one star less rating is because I am a fairly regular but casual user of the site. I want to enjoy it, but I don't allocate a whole lot of energy to it at this moment. This is largely because I am apprehensive about how the rating up votes and karma and demerits etc work. I find the system really confusing and yet not interesting enough to me to take the time to learn it well, so instead I just avoid REDDIT sometimes, even though a topic may be of interest. Prob'ly me.",2
"Would rate this between 4 and 5 stars if it was an option. Other than images taking a long time to load and the occasional bugs with closing the app after opening it to view a liked comment/post, the app's good.",2
"Not a perfect app, has issues like: only loading up to 10 posts and nothing more occasionally, the app won't open for me unless I Google search reddit (won't open when I click the app shortcut). Other than that it does what you want it to.",2
Its a good app,2
Love the new UI,2
"It's ok, I just hate the mods",2
This is a good site⭐⭐⭐⭐,2
"It's so diverse, I can go down memory",2
Good,2
Always has interesting conversations,2
I like the site. Lots of topics to explorer,2
"Only problem is when I miss pressing on the notification arrow and all Reddit notifications go away - if I pull up notification history and click ib a notification, it won't open with that message, but the one I already had open. Other apps are able to open their messages from the notification history.",2
Great app to read stuff you enjoy and discover new stuff to read. Again great app.,2
great,2
Works great so far,2
Good but not optimised for tablets,2
Good,2
Get all kinds of news here (and other conspiracy),2
It ain't as cool as Boost was that's for sure but it works ok,2
"It's cool, the news feed could b randomized a little more",2
Love if only they improve the video player.....would have been 5*,2
Still early but I like it so far 😌 good fun & so much variety,2
Fine not great,2
Amazing,2
Very good,2
Like the content but app is quirky at times,2
"Great app, but it can easily be an obsession.",2
I love all the reading about all the fun little story's and subreddits that talk about certain topics!,2
Thanks for your help,2
Mostly positive. Great app when it works. Which is most of the time.,2
Good app,2
"Constantly freezes on launch especially from hyperlinks. Then when it doesn't freeze it does not open the requested area. Update +1 login freeze issue is fixed. Hyperlinks still do not open the sub, but they do open the application.",2
Good,2
It's good. Honestly I'm not really an average internet user but I've found reddit to be the most original site I have ever been to.,2
informative more than instagram,2
Still new to this but trying have fun,2
Navigation issue other than that great work!!!,2
Its wonderful how you are able to give reviews on businesses and then get a review on your own reviews,2
happy,2
Informative,2
"Great source of information and entertainment. I dislike being forced to use an app, but the UI is pretty intuitive, and it isn't overly saturated with ads yet.",2
It's quite fun to use to join other content creators,2
I still like the app but the culture is very inducive to in-fighting amongst subreddits and forming echo chambers. Anyone who disagrees is downvoted to oblivion.,2
"Pretty happy with the Reddit app and content, a lot of information available",2
Great,2
Love Reddit!!!,2
It's a good thing. Interesting finds,2
I'll stand with my Oct 2023 review. Reddit continues to be a fun app. It provides a diverse and almost infinite variety of subject matter. It is an informative resource.,2
"The app is good, however there is a problem with uploading images, it simply doesn't work.",2
Lots of artificial intelligence people but great for certain topics.,2
Great presentation.,2
There is a little bit of everything content wise on reddit. It can be both the best and the worst of the internet so learn how things work and read the rules before posting! Subscribe to what you like and have fun.,2
I love it. It very helpful for bug identification.,2
Helpful,2
Just got it but so far it's alright,2
Two weeks since i joined and i halready benefited a lot. Love it.,2
"Love it! A classic app based on socializing, It's amazing! Big thanks to the developers It's a well made App!",2
It's so funny,2
It's a petty great place to find solutions to specific problems that Google or YouTube can't help with.,2
It is quite beneficial and informative.,2
Good. I get bullied for using it!,2
Best place for wasting my time on absolute nonsense I've ever had the pleasure of existing in!,2
I enjoy the app. Works as intended.,2
Good site for news,2
Good,2
I only rated it because I wanted it to never ask me again.,2
Ok,2
"Great network , nothing to personal but always fascinating",2
Cool!,2
It's good,2
I really like the app but every time I leave a comment or thumbs up the notification bell icon stays lit up and won't go off and it's very annoying 🙄😠!!,2
Interesting and informative,2
Can't download an image. Says download but doesn't show up.,2
A great tool for research,2
There are alot of political stuff on it which I personally hate!,2
"Love reddit as a tool, but sometimes it lags hugely.",2
Liked it,2
Good reviews,2
Cool,2
Most of the time... great experience,2
Great!,2
I like the freedom of speech,2
Banger 🔥,2
so what am mamlm,2
It works 🤷‍♂️,2
Good and amazing,2
Good...,2
I am enjoying me experience. And love control over what I see.,2
"Enjoy the wide variety of subs Reddit offers. Especially the photos of rabbits, birds, squirrels, cats, dogs. Lately I have also found useful threads re train travel.",2
Four stars cuz I have just begun reading reddit.,2
it works,2
"It's been nice so far, although there's room for improvement",2
"I enjoy reading the comments on current events. There's lots of racism to overlook, just like x. It comes from every ethnic group on earth. On some issues, lots of bots, just like x.",2
Excellent,2
I like seeing stuff I'm interested in without wading thru) lots of junk.,2
I like it. The videos are sometimes a bit finicky but overall Reddit is a pretty cool app😎,2
I dig it! Super cool awesome funtastic! Probably going to skip trade school and just learn everything here!,2
"On the whole it's a good place for just a natter, for a debate or for asking questions, especially gaming related. Just be prepared for the whiners and negativity in some areas.",2
It's ok,2
Entertaining,2
"Community sourced answers to questions I'd wish professional journalists would ask. Paid version avoids intrusive adverts. Moderation mostly centres SJW perspective, so scope of discusion can be limited. But that's on Reddit, the App itself is fine. Previously: It is difficult to filter out ads that bore or annoy me. I'm not trying to suppress advertising, just show me an ad that's interesting, informative, tempting, entertaining.",2
"Yes, there's always room for improvement and, Reddit, is only on the improve .",2
"This is a wonderful social app...respectful, knowledgeable people here.",2
"Edit 2: years later, and much better. Maybe it had something to do with Reddit getting rid of all their competing apps lol Evolve or wither, right? Edit: we're doing better; small improvements here and there. Most videos work now on mobile. Emails actually open the link 90% of the time. When I click on email links from Reddit, the app refuses to open. I have to copy the links and paste them into my browser. Not sure what that's all about.",2
"I absolutely love Reddit. I follow different parts but my favorites are about positive things going on in the world, people helping one another just because they can. I also really enjoy reading when someone posts a random question and so many people answer with a wide variety of information.",2
"Great communities, tons of useful information on a seemingly endless array of topics, just a great experience all around... thus far, lol. The fact of the matter is I'm not super active, I primarily just play the wallflower where most of the discussions are concerned, so I'm sure that's affecting my experience GREATLY.",2
"Love being able to talk with other gamers for help or info. For the most part, it's easy to use but then again a little confusing. I like that we don't get hassled about speech. Apps are super picky and ridiculous, but not this one..",2
"For the services that you say you offer, I would give them all 5 out of outdoors for working on this app. However, you'd better give it struggled. Innings, a shout out and thank you. Because he's the only reason I got your app. I was linked With the website for your app While I was researching, lost on fan girl mode, and just like that I'm here :) and I am struggles biggest fan. He changed my life 🥰",2
"So far everything with app has worked perfectly, alot of information and fun. Really starting to get way to many ads. When I first started watch Reddit there were no ads now I have to keep saying no on the ads. Please get rid of the ads or at least scale them to few and far between.",2
"I've been using Reddit for all my 'orthodox' queries for years, (even most of the 'normal' ones I normally would use Google for get better answers from Reddit - than Google itself!) but now having that in an app is great and much more convenient than going through a browser. The only thing I miss, is not being able to use my browser extensions that I rely on daily",2
"I love this app at times. People on here are from everywhere, I mean everywhere, so you never know who you are texting, and some people are just rude on purpose. I'm learning, but overall, it is a place for fun 😁 .the have many topics so I'm sure you will find a great group. I love wild animals, so I am part of that group.",2
"It's vastly superior to their PC interface. On the app I'm able to post multiple pictures AND write a lengthy description about them. I now have to upload images from my computer to phone so I can post content. Seriously Reddit, you need to fix this...",2
"Very straightforward. At times images or vids too slow to open, but that is more of an internet issue rather than the app. (I think??) Overall I give it a 👍👍👍",2
Love everything about Reddit except one time detail they keep on and off removing this one feature it's really annoying so you can't just swipe through everything at once you have to go off different pictures and go onto a different slideshow,2
"Very intuitive and easy to navigate. I'm an old guy and still find it well designed and thought out. Y'all did a good job on this one. Still pleased overall, but it would be great if we could control font size. 😀",2
"RedditHandle: u/KonradFelixCyprianus This app is an absolutely incredible tool for anyone who loves diving into the depths of online communities and discussions. Its intuitive interface ensures that navigating through the myriad of topics is a breeze, making it easy to find your niche or explore new interests. The design is sleek, modern, & user-friendly, enhancing the overall user experience. The seamless performance, coupled with its aesthetically pleasing layout, makes it a must-have.",2
"Honestly, when I first heard of reddit, I didn't even know what it was, or that it existed. Then once I found articles and things that led me there and I started using it, it has become one of my daily driver apps. I use it constantly, for Q&A, just to browse, news, but mostly, I use it to keep up on my tech. It's just very easy to navigate and I like the atmosphere of people on there vs. Facebook/insta, X, etc.",2
"Very enjoyable, I love pictures of people purchasing PS3 consoles especially those that are backwards compatible, I wish to get my own PS3 so I can play some nostalgia games from the ps1 and PS2 gens and hopefully get the old Xbox 360 along with one game and one game only which is lord of the rings battle for middle earth 2. I do have my own Xbox one and Xbox X which I love. But yeah PS3 and Xbox 360 for the win if I can get them.",2
"There seems to be a group covering most interests, with many overlapping interest groups noted. Given the difficulties in definitively sorting interests, this is what I expected. In exploring these overlaps, one encounters many rabbit holes and this aspect is most enjoyable 😁 to the curious.",2
I have enjoyed the reddit app and the communities I've found. Sometimes it can be hard to find your comments to respond and I don't always understand how things are picked for your feed. It is easy to search and sometimes I wish people would take advantage of this instead of asking the same question multiple times.,2
"The community here is awesomely active! I am quite new here so I am overwhelmed. Can't believe I did not know about this much earlier. It has most information (specially as a fellow gamer, the details here are amazingly helpful) - hate to say but it could be better than ""Ggle"" in terms of usefulness when hunting for specific dets ;) I'm lovin' it!",2
Loving Reddit! We're getting ready to do an update on the house we built in 1995 and the Reddit community is helping us choose a new design and what products to use. It is definitely helping what can be a stressful process go very smooth.,2
"A few days in I'm loving the concept of this site & the app is standard in layout & productivity. Though I have this ""this content is NSFW"" even though I have it set to alway show me this. Every time I go to a new place . Every time I click on a new pic/vid. Unless I'm doing something wrong.",2
"It took me a long time to warm up to it. For folks that are unfamiliar with Reddit, it's communication over the backyard fence, electronically. But, just because there is any subject in the world here, you have a chance to meet very interesting people, and the opportunity to waste an entire day by the time you look up and see But if you want to compare this to some NCIS show with seven seasons, here you have to read and push buttons which makes this an intellectual pleasure.",2
"While I do miss the old 3rd party apps, I feel that the official app has improved a lot since launch and that the devs are actively trying to improve it. I'm happy with the continuing changes and I'm hopeful they'll continue to improve it.",2
"Only discovered the usefulness of this App about 6 mths ago. It had been on my phone for some time but not used. Read a newspaper article about Reddit and since then, cannot not stop searching. There is a wealth of knowledge to be found. Wish I had discovered earlier.",2
I wish I would have gotten on board with Reddit sooner. I am more of a lurker and a reader than I am a contributor. I have learned a great deal about the world we live in as well as modern-day society with all of its hidden rules and conduct. There's so many people that freely Express how they genuinely perceive things and make sure their story with honesty for the most part and that's what I like about Reddit. Everybody is fake for the most part in real life. But then they get online andbereal,2
"Absolutely a wonderful app for the contents... I don't feel so alone in life, because I read the posts and know that others are having such a hard time... I wish that there were more stories that showed more of the human side and kindness that posts should have... There are some on this app who have nothing better to do than try to hurt a person who is down and out... Kindness is what most of us are looking for here...",2
Started using sometime ago because social media got to annoying. It became my one place to come see everything from news to just honest post by Reddit users. I like the feedback given by the user on any given topic. 🙂 It's also the best place to help get your mind off stressful things. Interesting postings at times.,2
Very reliable app when seeking information on pretty much any subject. People can get tangled up in conflict rather than sharing their opinions yet the threads don't always follow suit which is refreshing. Recommendations are sent without pursuing so it's easier to navigate through the entangled forums. Would highly recommend!,2
"I liked the older version of reddit. When you were watching a video, you could swip up to go to the next video. New update you have to go back and look for the next video to play. Can I request the older version.",2
The only safe social media site that exists. It's the most secure social media app because the way it's set up; you don't click links accidently while scrolling and get malware and have to factory reset all the time. I quit all my other social media apps because I kept clicking on malicious links while scrolling. Yours is still so I'm in control and and links have no web preview so they're easy to dodge. That's the best concept for cyber security! Kudos!🙌🏻,2
"Excellent platform - whatever your interest may be, there is a subreddit for it...my only issue is it's too bloody addictive! 4 May 2022....Still rated 5 star for me 🥸 Not so sure about the new format - gets confusing on times, but still the only platform for me 👍",2
"Update: things seem to have improved as of 2/14/2024. Happy VD, Redditors! Ever since the update the app has become unstable. Also I have to exit out of every video. Videos don't play. Feed doesn't refresh even after I close the app and reopen it. I wish I could uninstall the latest update.",2
Thank you for adding the ability to increase text size outside of system default. For some reason the default system text is always smaller in the Reddit app than any of my other apps. This feature helps so much for what is mostly a text-based experience.,2
On my phone daily using this terrific app sometimes two hours per day. I would definitely miss it if it were to go away. Always something new and entertaining. I Love It!!!,2
It is a dream come true for readers. We not only get to connect with others and share our interests but we also get and give recs. It is also amazing for authors to self promote and rwacha world wide platform without any form of payment!! 💯💯,2
Love it so far..the people seem understanding and supportive and mature compared to a lot of other social media platforms..and there's content almost on every other topic..love the diverse perspectives am getting.,2
"The only social media I use (properly). Plus, you get the best of Tik Tok, Insta, YT Shorts videos without all the annoying buttons overlay. 5/5 would recommend.",2
"Excellent variety 👌. Great app, still learning, so much I don't know how to communicate. I like it more the more that I use it. Over the past year I've found it have unlimited ways and avenues to express oneself and experience new ways of life. Reviewing on May 16, 2023, More avenues have opened since March. The site continues to get better 🙌 Continues to be outstanding 👏 👌 Fantastic site and diverse",2
"Great app! You will find videos here that you won't find elsewhere. So far, they promote free speech, unlike YouTube, Facebook and all if the other apps that you can upload videos and posts. That makes Reddit and Rumble the two big ones for free speech. Crazy that I have to put that in a review in the USA!! But it's true! The other apps remove, ban, shadow-ban, censor. Reddit does NOT censor speech!!!!",2
"I have always loved finding people with the same interests as myself!! Reddit does that and more. Even though I have other social media sites, I believe you can find everything you want one Reddit. If you can't, you can always ask questions, and others will answer!!",2
"I didn't use Reddit until recently, believing it was just a degenerate hive of neckbeards and such, but I have since learned that that isn't entirely true. In addition you can get so much feedback or help really quickly",2
Lots of different venues for nearly everything I enjoy. Just a tad too slow to react some days. But that's mostly on MY end of the stick.,2
In a general overview of the Reddit app itself I consider it the best of social media sites. In terms of the ability to generate a sub it can be bulky and a bit confusing and somewhat destructive in places. But I'm still learning this process ask me again in several months. Individual subs though over all are not generalized most stick to one subject only which I find quite restrictive. Many moderators do seem to be on power trips banning for very minor infractions a different subject,2
"Great place to spitball ideas, gain.insight and help others struggling along the trail of life like you are. If there were six stars... I'll probably regret this but, I'd give it a 6 out of 5. All day long. Except for the notifications I love it. Just haven't managed the settings the way I want yet.",2
"Decent and pretty much fully-featured. Quicker to use than the Web. I think there were issues with things like spoilers not working properly before, but it seems fixed unless I'm mistaken? As things are at the moment, I'm pleased to recommend this app as it is now!",2
"Reddit 🎂 is 2018 & is my favorite social media platform. I do not use other social media platforms. I like helping & connecting with people from all over the planet. If I can help just one person? It's meaningful to me. I find help, too. I'm not bombarded. It's 2023. I'm still using Reddit and enjoy it immensely. It has been especially helpful through the years of isolation the world has experienced and illnesses / being stuck in the house. Great way to explore the world!",2
"An awesome platform to share content, engage, and send gifts in the very possible way 😍. So, many professional and easy to use options 🤩. With a unique way of connecting with people 😌. Always had a great time using it 😎. Thanks for building such an awesome and unique platform 💓",2
"I Love this Community! Subs & such have been really current on all subjects, as far as I've been... & the rabbit hole is so deep. Admin. is well in touch with the user. Little touches a bonus, spam minimal. It just keeps getting Better.. Update: I agree with this statement... ""Rabbit hole is so deep."" and indeed; ""It just keeps getting Better."" I appreciate Reddit more after years of great content & serious commitment to quality entertainment for all. Thank You Reddit.",2
"I really REALLY have enjoyed this Reddit app for infinite reasons. I could elaborating on all the reasons why, only allowed 500 characters r allowed, I have so much to knock out off my ""To-do"" list that time is an issue😊 I'll give you my #1 reason why Im a REDDIT lover....#1 there are SO MANY subjects to discuss, get opinions & advice about, if you aren't able to find what you are looking for, you can just create the topic u want. I've had plants saved, help with Monopoly GO game, etc.😘",2
My number one app. There is a subreddit for everyone's interest. I've had my account for about 5 years now. I jut hope they don't start charging to use it because it is so enjoyable especially at night time. I use it at night to read r/ask reddit to keep my mind clear.,2
"Love the page and app. Sometimes funny, sometimes informative, sometimes reminds me that I'm not the only person staying in my bubble and acting like a cranky cat that wants tacos x",2
"It's somewhat awkward for me because it's an old phone, and the screen has bad spots, but the site itself is interesting and entertaining.",2
Honestly love this app. There are a few times when certain screens don't refresh properly... But that doesn't really bother me all that much. I enjoy Reddit way too much.,2
"Fun and entertaining stories, valuable info and thoughts on everyday topics, and all the tea! I love Reddit. I don't like to ask questions, but occasionally I weigh in on things important to me. There is something for everyone.",2
"Reddit is one of the more refined versions of social media and a great source of information at the same time. Add to that a few levels of witty ""fnar fnar"" jokeyness and humour, then you still have loads more.",2
"Great app, however, it seems that it is not optimized for my tablet(Lenovo Legion Y700 2023). Hoping you could optimize the landscape orientation for my tab. Thank you! :)",2
It's just like the website. It's intuitive and it's easy to navigate. I highly suggest that if you like Reddit then get to the app for your phone. You won't be disappointed.,2
"The posts crack me up! When I can not be on my bike, this is almost as good. I've also learned that some of my thoughts and beliefs about how things should be and the way it is , is quite different which has caused me to look at things more open mindedly. You should never stop learning.great fun. Some of these posts make me question how we have made it this far. Reddit is really like an open window to the world, there is always something to learn about.",2
"Reddit will keep you entertained for longer than healthy, i often find myself scrolling longer than i ever intended its easy to get lost in here so if you need to kill time or your bored and you would like to read or watch interesting stuff download reddit, theres no other app like it",2
"It's the perfect app for anyone who wants to anonymously post stories, questions, etc, and receive back some really off the wall stuff.",2
Fun entertaining educational enlightening enjoyable addicting I like the manner in which it works and there are tons of decent ppl utilizing Reddit for a wide variety of reasons. Number 1 I often find things hilarious.,2
Still learning how to navigate and may go premium to avoid ads...but I'm learning so much about my favorite topics...and having fun too.,2
"Love all the different and varied communities that are on this app. It makes it so fun as well as entertaining, especially when you don't know what you might see next as you scroll through the app",2
I like reddit. It has helped gain more perspective as a visual artist 😊 It is also great that I can host my own art community specifically for my artwork. Thank you! 😌✨🎉,2
"A wonderful source for peer-vetted information and recommendations. As well as a veritable cornucopia of anything and everything, a true dumpster divers hoard.",2
"Brilliant for soany different things. Reviews, gossip, how to's, and finding info you won't find anywhere else. Great for true crime lovers and those looking for information the other media tends to restrict.",2
I love Reddit. No problem with the app so far. The only complaint I have is that ALL the cool outfits for your avatar are expensive. Their should be some free ones that aren't generic. They're all like $24 and up.,2
"It's like a porn site for the intelligent. No really, they have a lot of interesting subjects and topics that gets discussed but be warned there is explicit content on here.",2
"There should be a way to post images/pictures in the comments. I've noticed with some you can, some you can't. I'm a visual learner, and that is how I like to reply / comment. Sometimes, it's easier to explain something if they could see it. It's good, though! It's the end of April, and I still enjoy it.",2
love the platform for the most part. like how I can find local things and places but I like the more adult oriented groups and pages,2
"Reddit is one of my favorite apps. It's good for socializing, catching up on the news, comic relief, and pretty much anything else you could think of. There's a subreddit for everything. That's a blessing and a curse. Stay vigilant.",2
"Of all apps to connect with others, this one is the absolute best. There's a subreddit for anything, and I like being anonymous. This is better than Facebook, Whisper, etc",2
Reddit is great. This should be the social media everyone is using because it's built around their actual interests rather than pushing a feed to endlessly consume.,2
I love reddit. You can find anything you want and it's super useful. Most Google results about car advice or diet advice include at least one reddit result anyway.,2
An unlimited source of contributed news/articles you don't find anywhere else. The reddit commentors are a cut above in their knowledge and can answer questions or expand on a subject. The communities are always greatly interested in their subject.,2
still enjoying the app. Having no issues at all with the app. Find it easy to use and follow the path and you'll find what your looking for.,2
App is great for getting detailed feedback and solutions to tech issues (especially cord cutting). LOVE REDDIT APP!,2
"I enjoy reddit because it gives me a broader perspective, helps me troubleshoot, get involved in things that interest me. I can share stories that may help others.",2
"I follow several threads. I have learned something about Bourbon, cigars, and Scotch. Nice to have things rated and dissected. And of course always some good laughs!",2
"It's all it's made out to be. Lots of topics, anonymity, and light on the toxicity. That may be to my decent boundaries, but it still holds true as my experience.",2
"Very useful support groups, shared experiences, and people just want to help one another.",2
"You need to be careful to accept that in general Reddit is by the people and for the people and there's lot's of good information to be found here. However, these are OPINIONS and as the old saying goes everybody has one. Great resource for me but typically a starting point or for needed perspective.... lot's of perspectives here.",2
"I like the reddit app. It allows me to get different viewpoints, perspectives, and professional insights on a wide range of topics.",2
"User friendly and variety packed. Downsides are confoundingly strict rules for posting on some subs and the general problem with the masses who may downvote because they disagree, despite your comment being perfectly relevant. Great app, though!",2
Hurray! Reddit app for Android added an accessibility option to increase font-size! A little clunky but it gets the job done. Thankyou,2
Very easy to use and. The community threads help alot with questions I can't get answers from anywhere els. A great place to search with out the distraction of advertising poping up .,2
"I really enjoy reddit. Most of the time you get people whom really know what they are talking about about and want to help you. I'm not going to lie though, sometimes you get people whom are rude and just want to stir drama for laughs. But that's all social media right!!! Lol. But anyways I really enjoy it and I'm on it very often.",2
It's actually a really good app as its easy to connect with community's that you enjoy and can also get new friends easily too. The app works smoothly and I haven't found a single bug/glitch in the app so I would recommend it to all,2
An amazing App to communicate freely in any group you can think of. Truly what it was meant to be. My phones a Galaxy S22 Ultra so I have no technical issues on the app. Others might but just not me.,2
"I find Reddit to be a valuable resource. Being able to post, read and share information on a variety of topics has greatly influenced my opinion on many issues. Observing the viewpoints of other bloggers are nice as well. Will continue to use as a go to app to see different views.",2
"When I have my back surgery I had the worst pain ever in my right leg afterwards, I was on gabapentin which did not work, I found out through Reddit that people have used Lyrica and that has helped the pain. I asked my doctor to switch me to Lyrica and for the first time since surgery which it's been 3 weeks I woke up the last 3 days without the leg pain. It's very nice to see what others are going through and that definitely helps. I love Reddit",2
"Loading pics can be a hassle if not formatted correctly. Other than that, it's very user-friendly",2
"I can spend hours on reddit. The ads have gotten annoying, but end of the day, it's a community of people who (mostly) are helpful and entertaining",2
Often better than Google for information. Just add reddit to the end of your search. Great communities for investing and cars. Travel. Must have app.,2
"What I live about Reddit is that it is all positive, at least as far as I have seen so far. There are no trolls just looking to insult people for no good reason. I love it, use it more than Facebook now. Edit: 4 years later and I still love Reddit and the exchange of ideas. I've seen some of the darker side of it, but I still find that there's more positive than negative.",2
"Covers pretty much any topic you're interested in, where you can info, opinions, experiences, etc, of people around the world!",2
"Newsweek's crossword puzzle.. numbers are missing or misprinted...overall , a pretty good & challenging puzzle.",2
"Is a good app for pretty much anything, great advice communities for a plethora of subjects too. Pretty much any topic you can think of there will probably be a community on this app for",2
"I get answers, options, and insights. A great break from news, business and politics from my other reading choices.",2
"Super helpful. I don't scroll on it often, but it is so helpful when it comes to finding people to answer your questions",2
"I read it mostly for jokes it has plenty of great dad jokes... It also has lots of sports for your favorite teams' comments, photos, etc. It's a nice app lots of history info, too",2

"The community here is awesomely active! I am quite new here so I am overwhelmed. Can't believe I did not know about this much earlier. It has most information (specially as a fellow gamer, the details here are amazingly helpful) - hate to say but it could be better than ""Ggle"" in terms of usefulness when hunting for specific dets ;) I'm lovin' it!",2
Good!,2
Great app that provides good information from normal users!,2

This is the only social media I have joined and I am having a blast! There are so many wonderful communities that help each other out with ideas and suggestions.,2
"Absolutely a wonderful app for the contents... I don't feel so alone in life, because I read the posts and know that others are having such a hard time... I wish that there were more stories that showed more of the human side and kindness that posts should have... There are some on this app who have nothing better to do than try to hurt a person who is down and out... Kindness is what most of us are looking for here...",2
Great app experience,2
I love it,2
Wow,2
"The ""adding a gif to your comments"" part doesn't work correctly. It'll let you find and pick a gif to add, bit once you start to type your comment or even just submit it, the gif disappears and turns into an asterisk * . Its's weird.",2
I have a lot of fun on this app. I enjoy the many different group topics and the freedom to express yourself openly.,2
"The app works great on my pixel 7 pro, I've never had any problems with it. Reddit is my favorite app and I use it a lot so it has to be good, It's where I get a lot of my information and ideas for further reading.",2
Enjoyable and fun,2

"It's very funny, sad yet informative.",2
"News at my fingertips. There are subs for so many special interests from bread to orchids to home repairs. Sadly, groups on the dark side subs still thrive, feeding foreign and domestic propaganda to redditors. These subs can and should be avoided. Look for the funny critter subs instead. So far Norton considers the app as safe.",2
You'll find conversations on literally every topic you can think of. It's pretty awesome but at the same time probably not good for children,2
Love the uncensored adult NSFW content and communication. 💯👍🏼☮️,2
perfect,2
Great content,2
Much better then X,2
Reddit is more informative than Facebook because it is optimized by the user's and the rules of use are clearly defined by the user and when all the citizens of Reddit police themselves openly it makes the online community a lot more fun and fair for everyone some time i think that what would i do if i had to choose between Reddit or Facebook F-B would be deleted before Reddit for the reason that i injoy reading the mostly informative answers to a wide variety of questions .+ some are very funny,2
"Good forums, chat, and subject matter.",2
Super good access to a variety of information.,2
Amazing 👏,2
Content versatility is amazing 🤩,2
It's like a whole complex world!,2
